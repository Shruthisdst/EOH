		<description>
			<p>Being the first manifest sound that emerged out of the ḍamaru (miniature drum) of Lord Śiva during his famous dance (tāṇḍavanṛtya), it is the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet and the fundamental sound without which no other letter can be pronounced. Hence it is identified with God himself or used as his symbol. The Sanskrit lexicons give as many as 31 meanings and it is used in six different ways in grammar.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In Indian philosophical systems, the word bādha and its derivatives are often used as technical terms, in the sense of objection or contradiction. Hence &#x2018;abādhita&#x2019; means that which is not contradicted, &#x2018;a&#x2019; representing the negative particle. For instance, truth or reality is defined as that which is abādhita, never contradicted. Obviously what is contradicted can never be considered true or real in the ultimate sense.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Lyrical poems, the compositions of the mystics of Maharashtra, are popularly known as &#x2018;abhaṅgas.&#x2019; &#x2018;Abhaṅga&#x2019; literally means &#x2018;unbroken or indivisible.&#x2019; The story goes that when Sant Tukārām, one of the greatest saints of Maharashtra, was compelled by his detractors to consign his poetical works to the river Indrāyaṇī, Lord Viṭṭhala (Viṣṇu) restored them to their author saying that the works were &#x2018;abhaṅga&#x2019; (&#x2018;indestructible&#x2019;). That apart, it is true that these poems and songs abound in philosophical, mystical and ethical teachings which are &#x2018;abhaṅga&#x2019; and hence true for all time. Besides Tukārām, several other saints like Jñāneśvar, Nāmdev, Eknāth and Rāmdās, including women saints like Janābāi and Kānhopātrā have composed these abhaṅgas. Importance of the divine name and its repetition in spiritual life, God-realisation as the <em>summum bonum</em> of life, the necessity of acquiring guru&#x2019;s grace, the harmony of worldly life and spiritual life, the need for inculcating moral values in day-to-day life are some of the oft-recurring themes of these compositions. If making the abstract spiritual truths intelligible and practicable to the common masses is the measure of success of religious reform movements, the Bhakti Movement of the saints of Maharashtra through their abhaṅgas has succeeded admirably. Even today these abhaṅgas are sung by the common folk.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Literally the word means a &#x2018;reflection,&#x2019; an &#x2018;appearance,&#x2019; hence, a false phenomenon which shows itself as the real. For instance, the reflection of an object in a mirror is an &#x2018;ābhāsa.&#x2019; The word is widely used in Advaita Vedānta in the context of the relationship between the jīva (individual self) and Brahman (the Supreme Self). The jīva according to one of the schools of Advaita Vedānta, is only an &#x2018;ābhāsa&#x2019; of Brahman in and through the medium of the antaḥkaraṇa (mind).</p>
			<p>In Hindu logic, the word is used with regard to hetu or cause. Owing to several factors, a real hetu can get obscured and a false hetu, hetvābhāsa, can appear in its place leading to wrong conclusions. For more details see <ref>HETVĀBHĀSA</ref>.</p>
			<p>In temple architecture, the word stands for a particular type of vimāna (tower over the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>).</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;non-existence&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The production of an effect is the sign of the existence of the cause. In the same way, the non-production of it is the sign of its non-existence. This is the line of argument adopted by the Vaiśeṣika system, one of the two dialectical schools of Hindu philosophy. According to it, the non-perception of a jar in the ground before us is the same as the perception of the non-existence, abhāva, of the jar. This is the only system which considers abhāva as a fundamental category of reality and describes four kinds of it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>prāgabhāva—non-existence before coming into being, as for e.g., the non-existence of the jar before it is produced;</li>
				<li>pradhvaṁsābhāva—non-existence after destruction, as for e.g., the non-existence of the jar after it is destroyed;</li>
				<li>anyonyābhāva—mutual non-existence of two different objects, as for e.g., the non-existence of the cow in the horse and <em>vice versa</em>; and</li>
				<li>atyantā- bhāva—absolute non-existence, as for e.g., the non-existence of colour in air.</li>

			<p>Some of the Śaiva schools of philosophy describe yoga as being of five kinds, one of which is abhāva-yoga. In this state, the fourth yogic plane to be ascended, the yogi transcends the world appearance in its various forms. He is not concerned with the world. To him, the world has practically disappeared. Hence the name abhāva-yoga, the mystic experi-ence (yoga) in which the world has been negated (abhāva).</p>

			<p>The icons of gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon, whether they are of the aspects of the Supreme or of the minor deities presiding over various powers of the cosmos, often display this pose. Usually the right hand is shown raised, exhibiting the palm and with the fingers extended. It symbolises assurance of protection from fear and danger. It is but natural for mankind, with its fear of the unknown, to seek protection from the Divine and to believe in an appropriate response from It.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In the eternal quest for happiness, peace and pleasure, man is often compelled to counteract the various forces and powers that thwart this quest. When common or natural remedies available to him fail to bring the desired result, he naturally turns towards uncommon and supernatural remedies. Attempts at enlisting the help of the supernatural, be it a fierce deity, a ghost or a disembodied spirit, are a common feature of all cultures. Hinduism seems to be no exception to this. The rites of abhicāra, though occasionally mentioned in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, are found in abundance in the last of the Vedas, the <em>Atharvaveda</em> as also the subsidiary works based on it like the <em>Āṅgirasa Kalpasūtras</em> and the <em>Kauśika Kalpasūtras</em>. These rites pertain to a wide variety of subjects ranging from curing serious ailments, inflicting injury on enemies and rivals, winning the love of the beloved, to securing long life and prosperity. For instance, if a woman ties a particular root on her body with appropriate mantras, the mind of her husband is attracted only towards her and not towards her co-wives. A person harassed by enemies can perform certain rites by which spirits called kṛtyās will come to his help in overcoming them. Persons suffering from incurable diseases are advised to wear certain amulets like mūlamaṇi, duly consecrated.</p>

		<description>
			<p>According to Hindu iconography certain categories of the images of Viṣṇu whose installation and consecration help in black magical rites for the destruction of enemies, are classed under the ābhicārika type. These images, whether in the standing, sitting or lying posture, are bereft of beauty or symmetry. Emaciated body, dark complexion, dark clothes and a shrunken countenance with the eyes turned upwards characterise such images. They are, as a rule, established in the outermost periphery of the village or town, known as the &#x2018;paiśācapada&#x2019; (the place where goblins live), in inaccessible places like mountain tops or thick jungles. Installation is done at inauspicious moments and worship conducted through magical formulae and sorcery.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;theory of words in relation&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The darśanas or Indian philosophical systems were very particular in working out their own theories about the meanings of words and sentences, because, upon these depended the development of their arguments to establish their schools <em>vis-a-vis</em> other schools.</p>
			<p>A word may have a direct meaning as also an implied meaning. When such words are put together to form a sentence, the total effect may be something more than the meanings indicated by the individual words. Different schools differ as regards the details.</p>
			<p>The above theory is propounded by the Nyāya school and accepted by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa (7th cent. A. D.) of the Mīmāṁsā school. According to this, the words forming a sentence, can have independent meanings also in addition to contributing to the total sense of the sentence. For instance, in the sentence &#x2018;gām ānaya,&#x2019; &#x2018;Bring the cow&#x2019;, the word &#x2018;gām&#x2019; is a noun in the accusative case and refers to a cow, an animal of the bovine class. The word &#x2018;ānaya&#x2019; is a verb in the imperative mood denoting the action of bringing. When related in a sentence thus, they give the total meaning that the person to whom they are addressed, is expected to bring the animal cow. However they do not lose their individual significance. The words when used independently continue to denote the animal cow and the act of bringing.</p>
			<p>This theory is not acceptable to Prabhākara Bhaṭṭa (a disciple of Kumā-rila), another teacher of Mīmāṁsā, forming a parallel school. According to him, words have no independent denotation and can denote something only when used in injunctive sentences (&#x2018;vidhi&#x2019;) in relation to other words. His theory is known as &#x2018;anvitābhidhāna-vāda.&#x2019;</p>

		<description>
			<p>Sins of omission and commission, when not intentional, can be atoned by certain expiatory rites known as prāyaścitta. Abhijit is one of such rites. It is actually a minor Vedic sacrifice similar in structure to the major sacrifice Soma, but requiring just a day to perform. It is specially recommended as an expiation for the sin of killing a brāhmaṇa.</p>
			<p>Abhijit is also the name of a nakṣatra (star or asterism) counted as the 28th, after uttarāṣāḍha. In mythological works, Abhijit is described as a daughter of Dakṣa-Brahmā and as a wife of Candra (the moon).</p>
			<p>The auspicious period that occurs at midnight is also called abhijit. Lord Kṛṣṇa is said to have been born at that time.</p>

			<p>One of the greatest warriors of the second generation in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> and a legendary figure, Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna and Subhadrā, and the husband of Uttarā. Trained in the martial arts by his father Arjuna and uncle Śrī Kṛṣṇa, he matured into a great warrior at an early age. During the Mahābhārata war, in the absence of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, Abhimanyu was obliged to break through the cakravyūha, the wheel-formation of the Kaurava army. Though he fought valiantly, he was surrounded by a multitude of Kaurava warriors and killed as he was ignorant of the technique of extricating himself out of that cakravyūha.</p>
			<p>However, before laying down his life, he fought bravely against the greatest of the warriors on the Kaurava side and displayed remarkable heroism.</p>

		<description>
			<p>If what is known as &#x2018;Pratyabhijñā-darśana&#x2019; (Kashmir Śaivism) has attained a respectable status among the medieval philosophical systems, it is mainly due to Abhinavagupta, the encyclopaedic scholar and prolific writer of the middle ages. His ancestors hailed from the &#x2018;Antarvedī,&#x2019; the country between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā rivers. He lived in Kashmir. His literary activities extended from about A. D. 980 to A. D. 1020. He was an authority on several subjects and at least forty works are attributed to him.</p>
			<p>His <em>Tantrasāra</em> is a voluminous treatise on Tantra. <em>Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-vimarśinī</em> is an authoritative work on the monistic Śaivism of the Pratyabhijñā school of Kashmir. Among his other works <em>Tantrāloka</em> and <em>Paramārthasāra</em> should also be mentioned.</p>
			<p>Abhinavagupta has carved out a niche for himself in the fields of poetics and dramaturgy also. His two superb commentaries, <em>Dhvanyāloka-locana</em> (also called <em>Locana</em>) and <em>Abhinavabhāratī</em> on Ānanda-vardhana&#x2019;s <em>Dhvanyāloka</em> and Bharata&#x2019;s <em>Nāṭyaśāstra</em> are considered as supreme authorities even now on those subjects.</p>

		<description>
			<p>All living beings, starting from an insignificant worm right up to the highly evolved man, have a natural fear of death and a strong desire to live. According to the Yoga system of Patañjali, though this is understandable, it is not desirable! It is not desirable because it is born out of avidyā or ignorance of the true nature of the soul which is really immortal. This very ignorance is a great stumbling block on the path to perfection. Hence abhiniveśa which is technically termed as a kleśa, an affliction or a vicious tendency, preventing the rise of true knowledge, must be cast off by the seeker of perfection. Spiritual practices like kriyāyoga will help the seeker in this task.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The ṛṣis (men of knowledge and wisdom), who were the spiritual leaders of the Hindu society, kept before it the supreme ideal of mokṣa, liberation from the transmigratory existence. However, they never forgot that man has a constitutional inclination towards the enjoyment of pleasures got through artha (wealth) and kāma (desires of the flesh). While recognising this, they also stressed the need to confine them within limits through dharma (righteousness), and instituted the system of yajña or sacrifice through which man could achieve the desired ends. Abhiplava is one of the sacrifices included under the Soma group of sacrifices and forms part of a bigger one called Gavāmayana. It is spread over six days and includes four ukthyas (a small Soma sacrifice) and two Agniṣṭomas (another Soma sacrifice with hymns of praise on Agni, the fire-god) and the singing of some Sāma hymns.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Caste has always been a dominant feature in the Hindu society. Division into groups based on vocation is a phenomenon common to all societies. But in India, such groups have often become fossilized and mutually exclusive, the membership of the group being acquired only by birth. Hence the appellation &#x2018;jāti&#x2019; (= birth). In spite of the vigorous attempts of its leaders to make the particular jāti a water-tight compartment, thanks to human nature, mixing has always taken place throughout history, giving rise to more castes, born out of the admixture of the prevalent ones. The ābhīras constitute such a mixed caste. They are regarded by Manu as the offspring of a brāhmaṇa by an aṁbaṣṭha (descended from a brāhmaṇa father and vaiśya mother) woman. Whether the ābhīras were a nomadic tribe which migrated into India by stages or were natives of this land, it is certain they lived a nomadic and predatory life. By the 2nd cent. A. D. some of them had attained high ranks and had even siezed political power, wielding it effectively till the 4th cent. A. D. Mention may be made of Ābhīra Īśvarasena, son of Śivadatta, supposed to be the founder of the Kalacuri-Cedi era (3rd cent. A. D.) who rose to the royal rank in northern Maharashtra.</p>
			<p>The common people among them lived by dairy farming. They have contributed much to the development of Indian music. The Apabhraṁśa dialect, a form of Prākṛt, is also their contribution. But their greatest contribution is towards the growth of pastoral legends centring round Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The modern āhīrs are considered to be the descendants of ābhīras and are scattered over the greater part of India.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a technical term used in Vedic liturgy to indicate the extracting of the soma juice from the soma stalks, by pressing them. There are two kinds of pressing: kṣullakābhiṣava (the little pressing) and mahābhiṣava (the great pressing). In the kṣullakābhiṣava, the Adhvaryu (one of the principal priests who does most of the ritual acts and recites the mantras from the <em>Yajurveda</em>) places a few soma stalks on one of the lower grinding stones (called upara), pours consecrated water (called nigrābhya) and beats the stalks in three turns consisting respectively of 8, 11 and 12 single beatings. The juice extracted is collected in a cup. In the mahābhiṣava, four priests sitting round the hide that holds the pressing stones (called adhiṣavaṇacarman) beat the stalks in three turns, after sprinkling them with consecrated water, using the crushing stones (called grāvan) for the operation. The whole act is a ceremonial ritual, forming part of Soma sacrifices.</p>
			<p>Abhiṣava is also the technical name given to the ceremonial bath taken before religious rites, especially sacrifices.</p>

			<p>The kṣattriya kings of olden days used to consider it a matter of prestige and pride to perform the Rājasūya-yāga, an elaborate and expensive ceremony of royal consecration. Abhiṣecanīya is the principal rite in the whole ceremony. The name is derived from &#x2018;abhiṣeka&#x2019; (sprinkling with holy water) which forms the most important part of the ritual. The Abhiṣecanīya rite which comes under the Soma group of sacrifices, is spread over five days, consisting of one dīkṣā (taking the vows), three upasad (a group of rites in which ghee is offered to Agni), and one sutyā (pressing of the soma stalks) days. The Dīkṣā lasts for a year. In the actual unction rite, the water drawn from various sources and places is kept in wooden vessels and sprinkled over the king by several people led by the priests including representatives of all groups.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Performance of religious and semi- religious rites to propitiate one&#x2019;s ancestors is part and parcel of many cultures in the world. The Hindus do it through śrāddha (death anniversary rites of departed ancestors), though its forms may vary from caste to caste. Inviting and feeding the brāhmaṇas of learning and character is not only obligatory but also considered highly meritorious since the spirits of the departed souls are believed to be satisfied with it. When these brāhmaṇas are partaking of the food, the performer of the śrāddha or his representative is expected to stand respectfully in front of them (abhi) and chant certain Vedic and paurāṇic hymns prescribed as suitable for such occasions, in their hearing (śravaṇa). The idea is that this helps in creating a spiritual atmosphere soaked in which the brāhmaṇas eat the food and consequently the forefathers will feel immensely satisfied and happy.</p>
			<p>Some of the hymns recommended by the dharmaśāstras to be chanted during abhiśravaṇa are:</p>
			<p>Gāyatrī (<em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 3.62.10), Rakṣoghna Mantras (<em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 4.4.1-5), Pitrya Mantras (<em>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa</em> 2.6.12.3), Apratiratha Mantras (<em>Taittirīya Saṁhitā</em> 4.6.4.1), <em>Puruṣasūkta</em> (<em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 10.90.1), <em>Śrīsūkta</em> (<em>Ṛgveda-khila</em>), <em>Pavamānasūkta</em> (<em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 9.1.1), Trisuparṇa Mantras (<em>Mahānārāyaṇopaniṣad</em> 38 to 40).</p>
			<p>While chanting the hymns, the sacred thread should be worn in the upavīta fashion (hanging from the left shoulder to below the right arm-pit). The chanting should be neither too loud nor too fast.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Honouring one&#x2019;s superiors is a basic dogma in Hindu religion and culture. As long as it was scrupulously followed, it contributed to the solidarity of the society. In the presence of a person worthy of honour, one is expected to rise from one&#x2019;s seat and salute him. The former is called pratyut-thāna and the latter abhivādana. After facing (= abhi) him, introducing himself and bowing down to him, the superior is expected to pronounce benediction (vādana). Hence the term. While offering abhivādana, it is necessary to repeat one&#x2019;s gotra (parental lineage) along with the name of the particular branch of the Veda traditionally studied in the family, and one&#x2019;s own name. During this repetition he should touch his ears and bend his head down. After this he can bow down touching or not touching the feet of the superior. In upasaṅgrahaṇa, another variety of abhivādana, clasping the feet of the superior at the time of saluting is obligatory.</p>
			<p>Elaborate details have been given in the dharmaśāstras with regard to abhi-vādana. For instance, it can be nitya (obligatory every day), naimittika (occasio-nal) or kāmya (done with certain rewards in view). Bowing down to one&#x2019;s teacher and parents everyday comes under the first category. Saluting the elders on special occasions like after returning from a journey, belongs to the second. If done at one&#x2019;s own will, seeking knowledge or long life or bliss in heaven it is classed under the third. Detailed rules have also been given as to whom abhivādana can be offered or should not be offered, the rules being based on caste, learning, status in society and age. It is noteworthy that salutation to women, except to one&#x2019;s mother, should be offered without touching their feet.</p>
			<p>The persons to whom abhivādana is offered should return it in a manner proper to their position and status.</p>

			<p>&#x2018;Practice makes perfect&#x2019; as the saying goes. Practice is nothing but repetition of effort to achieve perfection.

This abhyāsa when kept up over a long period, but in unbroken continuity, and with devoted faith, will become firmly established leading to yogic states (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 1.12, 13, 14).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Controlling the vagaries of the mind and concentrating it on a chosen object or theme is a formidable task. Only those who have attempted it can vouch for its near impossibility. However, the great teachers of yoga assure us that it is not impossible, though difficult. With the right attitude and determined practice, this becomes possible. The path prescribed is abhyāsayoga. This term which seems to be the creation of the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (8.8 and 12.9), a highly venerated scripture of Hinduism, has been interpreted in two slightly different but compatible ways:</p>
			<ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>abhyāsa or practice leading to yoga or concentration;</li>
				<li>abhyāsa or practice which is itself yoga since it leads to yoga or concentration. Withdrawing the mind repeatedly from the various objects towards which it is naturally drawn and fixing it upon the desired goal is abhyāsa. When this fixing becomes steady and grows in intensity, it ripens into yoga or perfect concentration, also called samādhi. Hence abhyāsa and yoga form the preliminary and final stages of the same discipline. Retiring into solitude, choosing the right place conducive to yoga, observing moderation in all aspects of daily life, practising self-control—these are some of the disciplines recommended by the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> for abhyāsayoga (<em>vide</em> 6.10-28).</li>

			<p>The Hindu scriptures, especially the dharmaśāstras, have always emphasised that a householder must strive for abhyu-daya (worldly prosperity) but not forgetting that niśśreyasa (mokṣa or liberation) is the ultimate goal of life. For a man of the world, it is certainly not wrong to entertain modest ambitions with regard to wealth, power, progeny or fame, to keep himself and his family happy and contented. On the other hand, he will be failing in his duty if he neglects his family and makes his dependents suffer. However, it is equally emphasised that while striving for abhyudaya, he should never forsake dharma (righteousness).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Belief in the continued existence of the forefathers (pitṛs) in a subtle body at a different plane (pitṛloka or the world of manes) is a common feature of mankind in general and the Hindus in particular. It is often believed that these forefathers when propitiated through appropriate rites can bestow on their descendants worldly prosperity, nay, even spiritual benefits. The propitiating rite is called śrāddha, since it is offered with śraddhā (faith). Of the several śrāddhas, ābhyudayika-śrāddha is particularly connected with abhyudaya (worldly well-being) and is performed on auspicious occasions like the birth of children, their marriage and so on. It can even be performed at the commencement of a charitable act such as the dedication of a well or tank or park to the public.</p>
			<p>Unlike the other śrāddhas which are solemn, this śrāddha is a joyous occasion. Hence certain changes have been effected in its performance. For instance: It is done in the morning and not in the afternoon. The yajñopavīta (sacred cord) is worn in the usual way and not from right to left. The mantra &#x2018;svadhā,&#x2019; which is a must in other śrāddhas is not used. Yava grains (barley) are used as the oblatory material instead of sesamum.</p>
			<p>This śrāddha is sometimes identified with Nāndīśrāddha or Vṛddhiśrāddha.</p>

			<p>Any spot of serenity and natural beauty can be made into either a place of picnic or pilgrimage. The choice depends upon the temperament. To the Hindu mind such spots reflect God&#x2019;s beauty and offer a congenial atmosphere for contemplation upon Him. One of such spots that nature has been bountiful in bestowing upon India is Mount Abu situated in southern Rajasthan and at a distance of 170 kms., (110 miles) from city of Ahmedabad. It is part of the Arāvalī range of mountains. The summit called Guruśikhara rises to a height of 1700 metres (5610 ft.) above the mean sea level. Referred to as Arbuda in the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, it is extolled as a tīrthakṣetra (a place of pilgrimage) on account of its association with the great sage Vasiṣṭha whose āśrama or hermitage was situated here. This is also supposed to be the place of origin of the Agnikula-kṣattriyas of Rajasthan like the Cauvhāns, Solaṅkis and Parmārs. Among the Hindu religious sites, the chief one is the Guru-śikhara itself, containing in a cavern the &#x2018;footprints&#x2019; of an ancient sage. The Acaleśvara temple campus has a cleft in the rock containing &#x2018;Śiva&#x2019;s toenail.&#x2019; The same campus contains a shrine for Arbuda Mātā, the consort of Śiva and the Mother-goddess of the hill. There are also shrines for the sages Vasiṣṭha and Gautama at Gomukha. The temples at Devāṅgaṇa are dedicated to Viṣṇu and Narasiṁha. Mount Abu is also famous for its Jain temples built in marble by the merchant prince Vimalśā (A. D. 1032) and the brothers Tejpāl and Vastupāl (A. D. 1197—1247). These temples are dedicated to Ṛṣabha-deva and Pārśvanātha, the 1st and the 23rd Tīrthaṅkaras.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Śiva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity responsible for the dissolution of this universe is worshipped both in the anthropomorphic aspect and as the liṅga. The latter however is the rule, the former being an exception. Etymologically the word &#x2018;liṅga&#x2019; stands for that in which everything gets dissolved (<em>līyate asmin iti liṅgaḥ</em>). Liṅga also means an emblem. Hence the Śivaliṅga is an emblem of God Śiva into whom everything gets dissolved at the time of destruction of the created universe. Since God is beyond name and form and since we cannot conceive of an abstract principle like Him without the aid of concrete symbols, a rounded surface is perhaps the nearest approach to him.</p>
			<p>Śivaliṅgas may be cala (movable) or acala (immovable). The acala-liṅgas, also called sthāvara-liṅgas, are the stone liṅgas permanently fixed in the temples. There are several varieties of them classified under four or six or even nine groups. An acalaliṅga has three parts: Brahmabhāga (square in shape), Viṣṇubhāga (octagonal) and Rudrabhāga (round). The first two parts are embedded inside the pedestal, the third part alone being visible. This is the one to which pūjā or worship is offered. Hence it is called the &#x2018;pūjābhāga.&#x2019;</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Rituals are an important aspect of every religion. If philosophy explains the basic truths and mythology expounds the same through stories and analogies, rituals give them a concrete shape and lay down the practical disciplines to be followed which will ultimately lead to the realization of those truths. In Hinduism such rituals are legion. In fact, even the basic acts of our daily routine like cleaning the teeth or bathing have been elevated to the level of a religious ritual. The idea is that our whole life is a yajña (sacrifice) or sādhanā (spiritual practice).</p>
			<p>Practically all the rituals have to be preceded by ācamana or ceremonial sipping of water. A few drops of water, as much as can immerse a grain of blackgram, are taken in the palm of the right hand cupped like a cow&#x2019;s ear (gokarṇa) and sipped from the root of the thumb (called brahmatīrtha). After sipping three times, various parts of the body like the eyes, ears, nose, chest and head are touched with the wet hand in a specified order. Ācamana should always be done in the sitting posture.</p>
			<p>The process of ācamana is believed to cover the prāṇa (basic life-energy, considered as a deity) so that it protects the performer. Even the ancient Upaniṣads like the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> (4.1.14) and the <em>Chāndogya</em> (5.2.2) seem to subscribe to this view.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;conduct&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The smṛtis and dharmaśāstras, the law books that regulate the life of individuals, both at the personal and at the social level, usually deal with three important topics: ācāra (ceremonial duties), vyavahāra (civil and criminal laws) and prāyaścitta (penances and expi-atory rites). Of the three, ācāra usually gets the pride of place. Literally, ācāra means conduct. It is often identified with sadācāra, the conduct of good and great men, so much so that dharma (righteousness) itself is said to be born out of ācāra, &#x2018;ācāraprabhavo dharmaḥ&#x2019; (<em>Mahābhārata, Anuśāsanaparva</em> 161.172). Whenever one is in doubt with regard to one&#x2019;s duty or action in a particular situation in life, one is advised to seek the guidance of the wise elders of impeccable character. Their words should be implicitly obeyed.</p>
			<p>The ṣaṭkarmas, the six duties included under daily routine, are the most important aspects of ācāra at the personal level. They are: snāna (bath), sandhyā (the sandhyā ritual), japa (repetition of mantra), devapūjā (ritualistic worship of the family deity), homa (sacrifice), Vaiśvadeva (offerings of cooked food to all the gods) and ātithya (honouring the guests). Undergoing the various saṁskāras (purificatory rites) and performing the prescribed duties as per one&#x2019;s varṇa (caste) and āśrama (stage of life) are the other important aspects of ācāra.</p>
			<p>The word ācāra is also used in the sense of &#x2018;customs and tradition&#x2019; which is equally important. No doubt the Vedas are the supreme authority in all matters regulating the Hindu society. Since they do not deal with the details of various problems that arise in the day-to-day life and conduct of the individuals, one has to rely upon the smṛtis (recorded collections of great sages) and sadācāra (the conduct of great men). However, in matters of dispute, falling within the jurisdiction of jurisprudence, ācāra as custom and long-standing tradition or usage, is often the decisive factor, provided it is not against the spirit of the Vedas and smṛtis. Such ācāra can be deśācāra (pertaining to the particular region), jātyācāra (pertaining to the particular caste) or kulācāra (pertaining to the particular family). Even the judges or the king had to take cognizance of these ācāras before giving their verdict.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In ancient India, education, the panacea for all maladies and problems of life, was imparted more by personal contact than by lectures and discourses. The student learnt more by observing the teacher&#x2019;s life than by hearing his teachings. Hence the teacher had to &#x2018;be&#x2019; that, which he wanted to &#x2018;make&#x2019; of his student. First &#x2018;be&#x2019; and then &#x2018;make.&#x2019; It is this philosophy of education that is reflected in this word &#x2018;ācārya.&#x2019; It is only he who successfully gathers (ācinoti) the essentials of dharma and wisdom from all sources and practises them (ācarati) in his own life, that deserves the appellation &#x2018;ācārya.&#x2019; In a more technical sense, the ācārya is one who performs the upanayana ceremony of the novice and imparts the Vedas to him, along with the accessories known as the Vedāṅgas.</p>
			<p>Great stress was laid on the quali-fications which the ācārya had to possess. Birth in a family known for its erudition and piety was always recognised as highly desirable. Deep erudition in the branch of the Veda he was required to teach was expected as a matter of course. A pure and sinless life, serenity and composure, active interest in imparting knowledge were the other qualifications looked for in the ācārya.</p>
			<p>The word is also frequently used as an honorific to men of great erudition and learning, especially if they are the initiators of new schools of thought or the revivers of old ones, like Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Madhva and others.</p>
			<p>The term is also applied to an adviser or preceptor guiding sacrificial rites.</p>
			<p>The wife of an ācārya is called &#x2018;ācāryāṇī&#x2019; whereas a woman preceptor is designated &#x2018;ācāryā.&#x2019; From this we can infer the existence of women preceptors also.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>If the solid world we perceive with our senses is a wonderful phenomenon, the unseen Power behind it is a deep mystery. The quest for the mode by which this unseen Power has evolved into this tangible world has resulted in several philosophical schools, often called &#x2018;darśanas,&#x2019; in the text-books of Hindu metaphysics. Of these, the Vedānta Darśana of Bādarāyaṇa has attracted the maximum number of commentators one of whom is Nimbārka (11th-12th cent. A. D.). According to him, Brahman, the highest Reality, is a personal God, identified with Kṛṣṇa or Hari. Brahman has two powers cit-śakti (sentient power, i.e., the indi- vidual souls) and acit-śakti (non-sentient power, i.e., nature). At the beginning of creation, He manifests these two powers. From acit-śakti or acicchakti, there is a gradual evolution of the entire material world.</p>
			<p>This acicchakti manifests itself in three different forms:</p> 
			<ol>
				<li>the prākṛta or what is derived from the prakṛti, primal matter, responsible for the material world;</li>
				<li>the aprākṛta, the non-material aspect, the stuff of the celestial bodies and objects as also the regions where the Lord and the freed souls live;</li>
				<li>kāla or time.</li>

			<word>Acintya-bhedābheda School</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>There have always been two major but parallel currents of thought—advocating jñāna (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion)—in the Hindu religious tradition, each getting the better of the other at certain periods of history. The school of jñāna or knowledge, based on the Upaniṣads and allied literature like the darśanas has always stressed that mukti (liberation from transmigratory existence) is possible only through ātmajñāna or knowledge of the Self. The school of bhakti or devotion, rooted in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, but dependent mainly on the epics and the purāṇas (mythological lore) has emphasized that such liberation is possible only through the grace of God, bhakti or devotion to God being the only means of obtaining it. Each of these two schools, being unable to ignore the logical and psychological force of the other, has been obliged to find a place for some of the principles of the rival school though relegating them to an inferior status. More sober thinkers have attempted at reconciling, even harmonising, these two viewpoints with varying success. The best of such attempts which has succeeded remarkably is found in that classic scripture <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam,</em> which itself is based on an earlier work of a similar kind, <em>Śrī Viṣṇupurāṇa</em>. The philosophical schools of bhakti, based on these two and allied works (e.g., <em>Harivaṁśa</em> and <em>Brahmavaivartapurāṇa</em>) could not disregard the Upaniṣads or the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> (also called <em>Vedāntasūtras,</em> a work systematising the philosophical ref- lections scattered all over the Upaniṣads) which had attained a very high status among thinkers and religious leaders. Hence they ventured to interpret the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> and the Upaniṣads by superimposing their views—commonly known as the Bhāgavata school—on them. Though it is difficult to assess the degree of their success, there is no doubt that they have enriched the Hindu philosophical tradition. Among such Bhāgavata schools, those of Nimbārka (11th-12th cent. A.D.), Vallabha and Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya or Caitanya (both of the 15th cent. A. D.) have gained recognition and respectability. The religio-philosophical system propounded by Caitanya (A. D. 1485-1533), Jīva Gosvāmī (16th cent. A. D.) and other scholar-mystics of Bengal is known as the Bengal School of Vaiṣṇavism, also designated as the &#x2018;Acintya-bhedābheda&#x2019; school. This designation obtains from the fact that the relationship between Brahman (God) on the one hand and prakṛti (nature) and jīva (individual soul) on the other, is &#x2018;acintya&#x2019; (incomprehensible) since both &#x2018;bheda&#x2019; (difference) and &#x2018;abheda&#x2019; (non- difference) can be predicated of it.</p>
			<p>The teachings of this school can be summarised briefly as follows: The ultimate Reality is personal, (Brahman or) Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the God of love and grace. He is the same as the Brahman of the Upaniṣads. He is sat-cit-ānanda (existence-consciousness-bliss-absolute). He is infinite, omnipotent and omnipresent. He is the very embodiment of all blessed qualities that we can ever conceive of. In this sense, he is saguṇa (with attributes).</p>
			<p>He has three śaktis or powers: svarūpaśakti, māyā-śakti and jīva-śakti. By his svarūpa-śakti (also called cit-śakti) he upholds his own existence and that of others, knows and makes others know, enjoys and makes others enjoy bliss. These three characteristics of his svarūpa-śakti corresponding to sat, cit and ānanda aspects of his, are called sandhinī, saṁvit and hlādinī śaktis respectively.</p>
			<p>His māyāśakti (also called acit-śakti or jaḍa-śakti), has two aspects: guṇamāyā comprising the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas; jīvamāyā, which makes the jīvas (individual souls) forget their true nature and hence get into the bondage of transmigration. God creates the universe by activating this māyāśakti. The created universe is real but transitory.</p>
			<p>All the living beings form his jīva-śakti (also called taṭasthaśakti).</p>
			<p>Creation proceeds out of him by the exercise of māyāśakti and jīvaśakti. Māyā-śakti evolves into the material universe and jīvaśakti involves the jīvas in it. The purpose of creation is to give more opportunities for the jīvas to get mukti by striving for it and by working out their karma.</p>
			<p>God who is the very personification of love and joy, assumes infinite forms including the avatāras or incarnations in this world. Of these, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the chief. His supreme delight is in love, manifested through the Vṛndāvana-līlā. Rādhā, the doyen of the gopīs and the eternal divine consort of Kṛṣṇa is actually the personification of his hlādinīśakti.</p>
			<p>The jīvas who are infinite in number and different from God, are conscious entities atomic in size. They get into the bondage of saṁsāra (transmigration) due to the ignorance of their real nature, brought about by māyā. Mukti is gained by breaking the bondage of karma through bhakti or devotion to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This bhakti can be like that of the servant towards his master (dāsya-bhakti), that of the friend towards his friend (sakhya-bhakti), that of the parents towards their child (vātsalya-bhakti) or that of the beloved towards the lover (kāntā-bhakti or madhura-bhakti).</p>
			<p>For practising the spiritual disciplines leading to bhakti, guidance from a competent guru (spiritual preceptor) is essential. Logic and reasoning are not to be trusted in the path of religion since they can undermine faith. Ethical virtues like compassion, tranquillity and equani-mity, humility and freedom from passions should be cultivated. Since all devotees are children of God, caste distinctions should be ignored.</p>
			<p>When bhakti matures into an abso-lutely pure and selfless state—called kevalā or śuddhā—the devotee aims exclusively at the loving service of Kṛṣṇa as the nearest and dearest one, for his happiness only and does not care even for mukti. This is posited as the fifth puruṣārtha. (See <ref>PURUṢĀRTHAS</ref>.)</p>
			<p>Though four kinds of mukti (See <ref>MOKṢA</ref>) like sālokya are recognised, the śuddha-bhakta is not interested in them.</p>
			<p>All this applies to the jīvas who are bound (baddha). There is another class of jīvas known as nityamuktas (ever-free), who have never been in bondage.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;acintya-bhedābheda&#x2019; itself needs some explanation. Hindu philosophers are broadly divided into two groups, one holding the view that in the ultimate analysis there is no difference (abheda) between Brahman and the jīva; and the other accepting difference (bheda). The Bengal school of Vaiṣṇavism differs from both and calls itself &#x2018;acintya-bhedābheda- vāda,&#x2019; since Brahman and jīva are identical (abhinna) in some respects and different (bhinna) in others, the very relationship being beyond our comprehension (acintya). Both being cit (consciousness) are identical in that respect. But Brahman is vibhu-cit (all-pervading consciousness) whereas the jīva is aṇu-cit (atomic consciousness). Again, the jīva is an aṁśa (part) of Brahman who is the aṁśin (the whole). Since the relation between the part and the whole is one of simultaneous bheda and abheda, the same subsists between Brahman and jīva also. How exactly this can be, is beyond human comprehension. Hence the appellation.</p>
			<p>On the side of dogma, this school accords Śrī Caitanya the same status as God since it believes that he is the combined incarnation of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.</p>
			<p>At the social level, the leaders of this school have contributed significantly by removing caste distinctions and encouraging the cultivation of primary moral and social values.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Man is a &#x2018;thinking animal.&#x2019; Once his animal needs are satisfied and he obtains relative peace and stability in life, he starts thinking about the &#x2018;how,&#x2019; the &#x2018;why&#x2019; and the &#x2018;when&#x2019; of things perceived. This thinking about the origin and evolution of things has got to be in the form of conjectures and hypotheses before being advanced as theories. Such conjectures and hypotheses again, can start only from the seen and the known before progressing towards the unseen and the unknown. It is but natural that this world in which man lives, moves and has his being (as it were), is the first to catch his attention. Such attention and thinking often leads to a broad categorisation of the created world. Of such categorisations, what can be more simple, direct and obvious than the twofold one, viz., the living and the non-living, the sentient and the non- sentient? This is exactly what the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta system—of which Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) is the chief exponent—has done.</p>
			<p>According to this system, the ultimate Reality is threefold: cit (the sentient), acit (the insentient) and Īśvara (God). The former two are dependent realities, subservient to the latter. (For details see <ref>VIŚIṢṬĀDVAITA VEDĀNTA DARŚANA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>The acit principle, as its very name indicates, is the matrix of all that is without life and consciousness. Also called prakṛti (nature), it is jaḍa (lifeless and insentient) but capable of vikāra (modi- fication or evolution). It is avidyā (ignorance) since it is opposed to true knowledge and also called māyā since it is the cause of all diverse creations. Being insentient it is incapable of evolving by itself but does so under the controlling will of God.</p>
			<p>According to one classification this acit has three aspects: the śuddha-sattva, the miśra-sattva and sattva-śūnya. The śuddha-sattva aspect has pure sattva guṇa (See <ref>GUṆAS</ref>.) capable of producing knowledge and bliss, and is the matrix out of which the world Vaikuṇṭha (See <ref>VAIKUṆṬHA</ref>.) has been made. It is un- affected by the karma of the individual souls and is directly under the control of God. The miśra-sattva aspect has the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas. It is this which evolves as this world, contracts and obstructs the jñāna (knowledge) of the jīvas (individual selves) and sustains their bondage by producing viparīta-jñāna (knowledge opposed to their real nature). Kāla or time forms the third aspect viz., sattva-śūnya.</p>
			<p>Whether kāla should be deemed as an aspect of acit or considered as a special power inhering in God has been a point of debate among the thinkers of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school.</p>

			<p>It is often seen that some persons become known to history because of their association with the more brilliant one who makes history. Whether the former, though deserving better recognition, are overshadowed by the latter, or, become known only because of their association with the latter who are head and shoulders above them, is a matter of opinion. Acyuta Prekṣa, who gave saṁnyāsa to Madhvācārya belongs to this group. Not much is known of him. As per the scanty information available in the work <em>Maṇimañjarī</em> of Nārāyaṇācārya (14th cent. A.D.), he was the head of the &#x2018;Bhaṇḍāra-keri Maṭha.&#x2019; His preceptor belonged to &#x2018;Ānanda-bāla Maṭha&#x2019; and hailed from Nandigrāma. Since there are several Nandigrāmas in the country, it is difficult to decide which one it was. Acyuta Prekṣa was an advaitin and belonged to the Bhāgavata school. It was he who administered the monastic vows and gave the new names Pūrṇa- prajña, Ānandatīrtha and others to Madhvācārya. He had to accept defeat from his own disciple while teaching him. In course of time, he was himself converted into a dvaitin.</p>

			<word>Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Each of the four Vedas, the basic scriptures of the Hindus, is divided broadly into two sections: the Mantra and the Brāhmaṇa. The Mantra section contains prayers and hymns. The Brāhmaṇa section deals with the application of these mantras in rituals.</p>
			<p>The <em>Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa</em> forms the sixth (and the last) chapter of a bigger work called <em>Ṣaḍviṁśa Brāhmaṇa</em> which itself is the second of the nine Brāhmaṇas of the <em>Sāmaveda</em>, available to us now. Though the first five chapters of the <em>Ṣaḍviṁśa Brāhmaṇa</em> deal with the ceremonies and rituals connected with the Somayāgas, the sixth one makes a comp-lete departure and deals with strange phenomena like ill-omens and the expiatory rites that help offset their effects. It is perhaps due to this reason that this particular section is thus designated (adbhuta wonderful, strange).</p>
			<p>There are indications to prove that the <em>Ṣaḍviṁśa Brāhmaṇa</em> originally consisted of only five chapters and the sixth i.e., the <em>Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa</em> was appended to it later.</p>
			<p>The entire book deals with adbhuta-śāntis or appeasement of portents, and is divided into twelve khaṇḍas or sections. The various portents indicating imminent dangers are described as being connected with the gods like Indra, Yama, Varuṇa and Viṣṇu; and appropriate śāntis (rites of appeasement of the deities) are also given. The idea seems to be that when these gods are displeased, troubles start and when appeased through appropriate rites, they cease.</p>
			<p>The list of portents given is quite long but interesting. Starting from the breaking or damage of household articles for apparently no reason, right up to natural calamities like earthquakes, destruction of crops and the fall of meteors, the list mentions the happening of many unnatural and improbable phenomena also. Among such, it is curious to note that temples shake and the idols of gods laugh, weep, sing, dance or close their eyes! This is a clear indication that temples with idols installed, had already come into being by the time of this Brāhmaṇa.</p>
			<p>The śānti rites are usually sacrificial oblations with suitable mantras addressed to the deity that has been displeased.</p>

			<word>Adbhuta Rāmāyaṇa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the two great epics of India, the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> of Vālmīki, has been the basic text for the story of Rāma. It has been the primary source of inspiration over the millennia, for many a poet who has retold the story in his own way, often adopting it to the philosophy of his life. One such work is the <em>Adbhuta Rāmāyaṇa</em> (&#x2018;the Wonder that is Rāmāyaṇa&#x2019;). Though attributed to Vālmīki, it is obviously a late work. Scholars are divided about its being earlier or later to another, more well-known work, the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> (A. D. 1400). The glorification of Kālī and identifying her with Sītā induce us to think that the work must have been written at a time when reconciling the Rāma cult of the Vaiṣṇavas and the Śākta cults had become a social necessity. Also, the words in the colophon as seen from a printed text—&#x2018;iti ārṣe śrīmad-rāmāyaṇe vālmīkīye ādikāvye adbhutottarakāṇḍe...&#x2019;—give rise to the suspicion that the writer might have attemp-ted to pass it off as an appendix to the <em>Uttarakāṇḍa</em> of Vālmīki&#x2019;s <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Adbhuta Ramayaṇa</em> is a compa-ratively smaller work of 1355 verses spread over 27 sargas or chapters. Unlike the other Rāmāyaṇas it is not divided into kāṇḍas or books.</p>
			<p>The contents of the work may be summarized briefly as follows: The sage Bhāradvāja approaches the great sage Vālmīki and requests him to give the secret teaching that is hidden in his original <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> which is rather voluminous. Vālmīki replies that the real secret is that Rāma is the Highest Brahman and Sītā, the Highest Prakṛti, the power of Brahman. Then he goes on to narrate the reasons for the descent of Rāma (sargas 2 to 4) and Sītā (s. 5 to 7), which were apparently due to the curses of the sages Nārada and Parvata, but really to destroy the wicked and protect the good. This is followed by the story of the birth of Sītā as the daughter of Rāvaṇa, but abandoned by his wife Maṇḍodarī, and found by Janaka, the king of Mithilā, in his field. After this, the events move at a terrific speed: Rāma&#x2019;s marriage, Paraśurāma&#x2019;s humiliation at the hands of Rāma (s. 9), Rāma&#x2019;s entering the forest along with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa (The entire episode of the <em>Ayodhyākāṇḍa</em> of Vālmīki&#x2019;s <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> leading to Rāma&#x2019;s banishment is glossed over here!), Sītā&#x2019;s abduction by Rāvaṇa and Rāma striking friendship with Sugrīva and Hanumān (s.10). In answer to the simple question that Hanumān asks, &#x2018;Who are you?&#x2019; (s.10) Rāma waxes eloquently to describe himself as the Ātman, Parameśvara, Māyāvī and Antaryāmin (s. 11 and 12). Most of the ideas and even the words are reminiscent of the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, and some of the Upaniṣads. This is followed by a short discourse on bhakti or devotion (s. 13) and a curious mixture of a variety of philosophical and mythological topics (s. 14). The next chapter contains a beautiful hymn of Hanumān on Rāma (s. 15). The sixteenth sarga disposes off very briefly (in 20 verses) the entire story of the <em>Yuddhakāṇḍa</em>. In the seventeenth, Sītā reveals the existence of a thousand-headed Rāvaṇa, the elder brother of the ten-headed demon, and describes him as she had heard from a brāhmaṇa in her younger days. Hearing this, Rāma starts on an invasion of the Puṣkara Dvīpa, the abode of the thousand-headed monster, in order to destroy him. In the terrific war that ensues, Rāma falls down unconscious (s. 18 to 22). Seeing this tragedy that had overtaken Rāma and his forces, Sītā assumes the terrible form of Kālī and destroys the demon along with all his forces. She is helped in this by her innumerable emanations (s. 23). Rāma wakes up and is surprised to see Kālī there (s. 24). He praises her with a long hymn containing 1008 names (s. 25). Though called <em>Sītā-sahasranāma</em> (&#x2018;thousand names of Sītā&#x2019;) almost all the names belong to the Śakti cult. Sītā dissolves the form of Kālī and reappears in her original form. After thus gaining victory, Rāma returns to Ayodhyā and resumes his rule (s. 26 and 27).</p>
			<p>Though this work might have served a specific purpose during the days of its composition and later, it fails to come up to the level of the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa</em>.</p>

		<description>
			<p>One of the questions discussed frequently in Hindu metaphysical works is the relationship between God, the creator and the created world. Most of them subscribe to the view that God creates the world, sustains and supports it and dissolves it at the end of a cycle of creation. The created world cannot exist unless it is supported and sustained by him. He is thus the ādhāra (the ground and the support) and the world itself is ādheya (&#x2018;that which is supported&#x2019;). The relationship that subsists between them is called &#x2018;ādhara-ādheya-bhāva.&#x2019; The relationship that exists between the ground and a jar kept on it gives us some idea of this &#x2018;ādhāra-ādheya-bhāva.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>In the works on yoga, the word is used to indicate certain centres in the body like the navel, the heart or the middle of the eyebrows which act as supports for meditation or prāṇa (life-force).</p>
			<p>In Sanskrit grammar the word is used to indicate the sense of the locative case.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Belief in God and putting up structures to worship him or to pray to him seems to be a common trait of human beings irrespective of their geographical boundaries or differences of culture. There are evidences to show that the Hindu places of worship, called devālayas (temples, houses of God), have been existing since very ancient times. These devālayas are highly symbolic and attempt at unravelling this symbology, in concrete terms, have resulted in a regular science and art of temple construction. Apart from the usual foundation laid to support the superstructure of the temple, these works on temple construction insist on the laying of the ādhāraśilā or support-stone below the floor of the garbhagṛha (<em>sanctum sanctorum</em>).</p>
			<p>In the middle of the site for the garbhagṛha, where the idol will be installed, the ground is excavated to a pre-determined depth. A number of articles are ceremonially fixed therein, one after another, with appropriate mantras. (See <ref>ṢAḌĀDHĀRA-PRATIṢṬHĀ</ref>.) Of these, the ādhāraśilā is the first to be fixed, and at the lowest level, as the base or support. It is a square block of granite or any other hard stone, of specific dimensions. On it are placed the other articles like the pot called nidhikumbha and the lotuses of stone and metal.</p>
			<p>According to one of the interpretations of temple symbolism, the temple represents the body of the yogi (the spiritual aspirant practising yoga) with all the cakras (centres of psychic power). The ādhāra-śilā, then, stands for the mūlādhāra-cakra (the lowest centre).</p>

			<word>adharma</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;unrighteousness&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Among the pairs of words used often by the Hindu scriptures, the pair &#x2018;dharma-adharma&#x2019; is perhaps the most recurrent. Since the etymological definition of &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; is &#x2018;that which supports and sustains,&#x2019; all that attempts to destroy or oppose or reverse this process of supporting and sustaining comes within the purview of the word &#x2018;adharma.&#x2019; If dharma is the straight path that leads to abhyu-daya (well-being and prosperity) and niśśreyasa (spiritual perfection), adharma is the crooked path that leads away from both. If dharma indicates actions and duties, ritualistic or otherwise, which are in conformity with the teachings of the śāstras (holy scriptures) and ācāryas (spiritual and religious leaders), and not antagonistic to sampradāya (customs and traditions), adharma stands for all errors of omission and commission.</p>
			<p>In practice however, the word is more frequently used in the sense of unrighteous deeds and conduct resulting in sin. For instance, telling lies, stealing, cheating, adultery and committing such other forbidden acts and crimes are adharma. Dereliction of duties and not discharging the responsibilities one is entrusted with, are adharma. Performing such acts as are not prescribed for one—for e.g., a brāhmaṇa taking to arms or agriculture even though there is no urgency or emergency—is also considered adharma.</p>
			<p>The personified adharma, in the mythological lore, is said to have hiṁsā (violence) as his wife, anṛta (falsehood) as his son, and nikṛti (deceit) as his daughter. Māyā (delusion), bhaya (fear), vedanā (torment), naraka (hell), duḥkha (sorrow) and mṛtyu (death) are the other offsprings coming in that lineage (<em>vide Viṣṇupurāṇa</em> 1.7). Though the details of such lists may vary, the purport is clear: adharma is at the root of all our fears, troubles and sufferings.</p>
			<p>In Jaina metaphysics, adharma is considered to be a dravya (substance) responsible for restful state and immobility of things.</p>

			<word>ādhi</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;illness of the mind&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The ancient Hindu sages have recognised that the body and the mind form one unit and that this unit is of fundamental importance in achieving anything worthwhile in life. Hence each should be kept in a healthy condition and in harmony with the other. Vyādhi (illness of the body) and ādhi (illness of the mind) are both considered to be serious obstacles in the path of progress, whether temporal or spiritual.</p>
			<p>In most general terms, anything that disturbs the equilibrium of the body is a vyādhi and anything that upsets the equi- poise of the mind is an ādhi. The ariṣaḍ- vargas or six enemies viz., lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride and envy, as also worries and anxieties are examples of ādhi. Rāga (attachment) and dveṣa (aversion) are the root causes of all ādhis. Conquest of these will help in removing the ādhis.</p>
			<p>In the dharmaśāstras, the word is used in the sense of a pledge, deposit or article of mortgage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The three words respectively mean: pertaining to</p>
			<ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>the bhūta or living beings;</li>
				<li>the daiva or fate, unseen forces and gods;</li>
				<li>the ātma or the body (and the mind).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sorrow and suffering (duḥkha, tāpa) are inevitable in life. In fact, they are a part of life. A knowledge of their origin, causes and even categorisation helps one to minimise their effect if not eradicate them. The Hindu religious works usually call them &#x2018;tāpatraya,&#x2019; &#x2018;the three miseries.&#x2019; They are: ādhyātmika, ādhidaivika and ādhibhautika.</p>
			<p>The ādhyātmika duḥkha or tāpa is that which is caused by bodily suffering and mental anguish. Hereditary diseases like leprosy, disabilities like blindness or lameness and diseases caused by the violation of the rules of health and sanitation are classed under this. The mental agony caused by worries and anxieties, attachment and aversion, also comes under this group.</p>
			<p>The ādhidaivika duḥka or tāpa is that which is caused by daiva. The word daiva includes the power of time, nature and the unseen hand or fate. Diseases caused by the changing seasons, misery caused by the elemental forces like floods and fire, suffering caused by black magic or disembodied spirits or gods who are displeased, natural tribulations due to hunger, thirst and old-age belong to this group.</p>
			<p>The ādhibhautika duḥkha or tāpa is that which is caused by other bhūtas or living beings, like wild animals, snakes, or enemies.</p>
			<p>Some of these, like hereditary diseases or physical disabilities cannot be got rid of. Hence they must be endured. Some like the diseases caused by change of seasons or the machinations of enemies can be countered by taking appropriate precautions. However, raising the mind to the level of the spirit, thus transcending the limitations imposed by the body-mind complex, is the best solution to offset the effects of tāpatraya.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;intercalary month&#x2019;)</note>
			<alias>adhimāsa</alias>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>From the most ancient times, all religious activity of the Hindus was performed at times considered auspicious or suitable for them. Calculations were done based on the movements of the sun, the moon, the planets and the stars. This resulted in the growth of an entire science of Vedic Astronomy, &#x2018;Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The most fundamental periods of time, common to all the nations are the day, the month and the year. The day is due to the revolution of the earth round its axis. The month is mainly a lunar phenomenon based on the waxing and waning of the moon. The year is due to the apparent motion of the sun as seen from the earth. Hence the Hindus followed a luni-solar calendar from the ancient times, and being aware of the difference between the two ways of calculating, also provided for the necessary adjustments to be made to bring the two into consonance. The lunar year on which are based the religious activities, is less than the solar year by about eleven days. Hence two intercalary months are added in five years, one being a second āṣāḍha (the 4th lunar month) at the end of 2 years and a second pauṣa (the 10th lunar month) at the end of another 2 years. This is according to Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa. Later works give varying periods after which the intercalary month occurs. The general rule seems to be that the lunar month in which no saṅkrānti (apparent movement of the sun from one constellation to the next, as seen from the earth) occurs, is called an adhikamāsa and bears the same name of the next lunar month which is called śuddha or nija or prākṛta, to distinguish it from the former.</p>
			<p>Somehow, the adhikamāsa was considered even from the ancient times, inauspicious and hence named malamāsa (&#x2018;the dirty month&#x2019;), malimluca (&#x2018;a thief&#x2019;), aṁhaspati (&#x2018;the lord of sins&#x2019;) and so on. During this month one was advised to avoid acts like consecrating Vedic fires, installing images, offering gifts, observing vratas or religious vows, performing upanayana and other saṁskāras (puri- ficatory rites).</p>
			<p>However in some purāṇas like the <em>Padma</em> (6.64) the intercalary month is named &#x2018;puruṣottama-māsa&#x2019; (&#x2018;month of Lord Viṣṇu&#x2019;), probably with a view to reducing the opprobrium attached to it and considered, on the other hand, as holy.</p>

			<word>adhikāra</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;competence&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>All people are not endowed with equal ability. To perform an act properly and efficiently one must have at least the minimum capacity and competence in that field. Training can improve it but cannot create it. This patent fact has been recognised by the Hindu scriptures and propagated under the nomenclature &#x2018;adhikāra.&#x2019; For instance, it is the man who is endowed with physical strength and mental courage that has the adhikāra for joining the armed forces. Similarly it is the person who is endowed with more than average intelligence, a fair degree of scholarship and a capacity to speak well, that has the adhikāra to enter the teaching profession. Again, it is the person who has practised at least to a certain degree, purity and self-control, that has the adhikāra to become a monk.</p>
			<p>In most cases, adhikāra can be developed by assiduous cultivation. One who has adhikāra is called an &#x2018;adhikārin&#x2019; and the doctrine that advocates the need for adhikāra is called &#x2018;adhikāravāda.&#x2019; The differences among the adhikārins are termed &#x2018;adhikāribheda.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>In this creation there is nothing that is absolute. Everything is relative. Divergences and differences do exist. The &#x2018;Doctrine of Adhikāra or Adhikārabheda&#x2019; is just a recognition of this patent fact. It does not necessarily suggest a gradation, with its corollary of &#x2018;higher&#x2019; and &#x2018;lower&#x2019; status, implying pride or contempt. It is more an acceptance of a fact as it exists, helping one to understand where one stands and start one&#x2019;s progress from that base. Also it is designed to awaken one to one&#x2019;s duties rather than to one&#x2019;s rights and privileges.</p>

			<p>In the Mīmāṁsā philosophy, it is used as a technical term and indicates the section of a work dealing with a particular topic.

			<word>Adhikāra Nandi</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Everyone that enters a Śiva temple cannot fail to see the image of Nandi, the reclining bull. In iconography, Nandi or Nandikeśvara is depicted in two forms as vṛṣabha or reclining bull and as Adhikāra Nandi, an image resembling that of Śiva. In this aspect , the two back hands hold the paraśu (battle axe) and the mṛga (antelope) and the two front hands are folded on the chest in the añjali (obeisance) pose. In all other respects, the characte-ristics of the image are identical with those of Śiva.</p>
			<p>Since he is the chief of the gaṇas (retinues) of Śiva, exercising his authority (adhikāra) over them, he is christened &#x2018;Adhikāra Nandi.&#x2019; He is also called Nandīśvara or Nandikeśvara.</p>
			<p>As regards the origin of this deity, there are three different accounts available in Hindu mythology. Desirous of a son, a sage Sālaṅkāyana by name, propitiated Viṣṇu, who granted his wish by producing a boy exactly resembling Śiva, from the right side of his body. He was named Nandikeśvara. According to another account, a sage called Nandi obtained the status of a god and the headship of the gaṇas of Śiva by propitiating him. A third account depicts him as emerging from the yāgaśālā (sacrificial shed) of the blind sage Śilāda, in the form of an young lad resembling Śiva, thus bringing &#x2018;nandi&#x2019; or joy to him. Śilāda adopted him as his son.</p>
			<p>Adhikāra Nandi took a prominent part in the destruction of Dakṣa&#x2019;s sacrifice.</p>
			<p>He is more often represented as a bull and also described as the vāhana (mount) of Śiva.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Vedic sages were fond of performing sacrifices to propitiate the various deities like Indra through whom they could fulfil their wishes. In one group of such sacrifices called Somayāgas, the libation of the juice of the soma creeper was the most important ceremony. The act of pressing out the juice from the creeper was no less important and even that had a ritualistic bearing. The word &#x2018;adhiṣavaṇa&#x2019; is used to indicate both this act of pressing the soma creeper and the wooden contrivance used in the process. More often, the latter which is in the form of a pair of semicircular wooden boards, is called &#x2018;adhiṣavaṇa-phalaka.&#x2019;</p>

		<description>
			<p>While discussing the theory of illusory perception, this word is often used in Vedānta to denote the substratum wherein the illusion occurs. For instance, when a snake is perceived in a rope, or silver in nacre, the rope or the nacre forms the &#x2018;adhiṣṭhāna&#x2019; or substratum, for this illusory perception. Ignorance of this adhiṣṭhāna causes the illusion and its true knowledge dispels it.</p>
			<p>While enumerating the five causes responsible for the accomplishment of every action, the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (18.14) puts &#x2018;adhiṣṭhāna&#x2019; as the first in the list. The word is interpreted there as the body, since the body is the primary basis necessary for all actions.</p>
			<p>In works on Hindu Architecture including Temple Architecture, the word denotes the basement of a building or even a column. Innumerable varieties of the same are detailed in those works.</p>
			<p>In Civics, the word was used to indicate a seat of administration like a city-council.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Temples form a very important part of the Hindu religious institutions and culture. Building of temples has developed, over the years, into a great art. Architecture and iconography have grown both vast and deep because of it. The images, though prepared strictly according to the standards of iconography, are unfit to be installed in them unless sanctified ceremonially by rites recommended in the āgamas (a class of religious works connected with temple worship). &#x2018;Adhivāsa&#x2019; is such a rite, making the image &#x2018;live in&#x2019; various substances like water and grains. The adhivāsas are three: jalādhivāsa, dhānyādhivāsa and śayyādhivāsa. The first is to remedy the effects of chiselling, the second for purifying the physical image and the last for inducing spiritual effulgence.</p>
			<p>In jalādhivāsa (&#x2018;living in water&#x2019;), the image is taken in a procession round the village, placed on level ground on the bank of a river or tank, sprinkled with the water of the same, wound round with kuśa grass and new cloth and ceremonially immersed in the water so that the head lies towards the east and mouth upwards. The duration of jalādhivāsa is from one night to nine nights, though three nights are more common. After taking it out of water, the image has to undergo physical and ceremonial cleansing once again.</p>
			<p>Dhānyādhivāsa (&#x2018;living in grains&#x2019;) and śayyādhivāsa (&#x2018;living in the bed&#x2019;) are actually one ritual in practice. On the vedi (special platform) a sthaṇḍila (an esoteric geometric design) is inscribed. Grains like wheat, rice, barley and black sesame are spread and a lotus of eight petals is inscribed on the grains. A bed is now prepared over this with five materials viz., wooden plank, skin of deer or tiger, a rug of animal hair, feathers of birds and cloth. In the absence of the first four materials, five layers of cloth can be used. The image is now made to lie for three nights on this bed, with kuśa grass underneath it, the head being towards the east and mouth upwards.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;adhivāsa&#x2019; is also used in the sense of &#x2018;perfuming&#x2019; or sanctifying with perfumes or other approved materials, any object or objects used in ceremonial worship.</p>

			<p>The dharmaśāstras have made it obligatory for every man born in the brāhmaṇa, kṣattriya and vaiśya castes to undergo the sacrament of upanayana (See <ref>UPANAYANA</ref> for details.) after which alone he becomes eligible for the study of the Vedas and the performance of ordained rituals. A concrete part of this sacrament is the investiture with the sacred thread called &#x2018;upavīta&#x2019; or &#x2018;yajñopavīta&#x2019; which should be worn permanently on the body. One of the three modes of wearing this upavīta is &#x2018;adhonivīta&#x2019; or &#x2018;adhovīta&#x2019; or &#x2018;saṁvīta&#x2019;. In this mode, the sacred thread hangs from the neck like a garland, stretching below the navel. This mode of wearing is recommended at the time of performing secular activities. The relatives of a dead person—if he belongs to any of the first three castes—attending his funeral procession are also required to wear the sacred thread in this mode.</p>

			<p>Human beings by nature, are interested in getting the good things of life so that they can live in comfort, happiness and peace. Those of them that believe in an after-life, are also interested in perfor-ming those acts here, that assure them a happy life hereafter. If the religious and spiritual leaders do not show them the right way, in all likelihood, they will take to the wrong way, the way of selfishness, competition and even fighting among themselves. Hence the need to show them the right path, the straight path, the good path. This is exactly what &#x2018;adhvara&#x2019; is. Etymologically it means a path which is not crooked, which does not cause harm to others. But in usage, it means a Vedic sacrifice. Since the Vedic sacrifices point the straight and good path for the fulfilment of man&#x2019;s wishes, here and hereafter, it is but proper that they are designated &#x2018;adhvara.&#x2019;</p>

		<description>
			<p>Man aspires after maximum happiness but with minimum effort, if he can help it. This aspiration can often tempt him to resort to shortcut methods which will entail a lot of suffering to other beings. The Vedic ṛṣis (sages) who had thoroughly understood human psychology, propounded and propagated a system of sacrifices by following which man could get his desires fulfilled, in a righteous way.</p>
			<p>Every such sacrifice must have a minimum of four priests: hotā, adhvaryu, udgātṛ and brahmā. Adhvaryu, the second priest who follows the <em>Yajurveda</em>, is by far the most active of the group. It is he who surveys the sacrificial ground, designs and builds the altars, prepares or secures the utensils, cooks the sacrificial oblations, fetches water and wood, kindles the fires, brings the animals and immolates them, all the while repeating the appropriate mantras from the <em>Yajurveda</em> at appropriate times. Being constantly on the move, he has no fixed seat. He is normally assisted by three priests: pratiprasthātṛ, neṣṭṛ and unnetṛ. Sometimes the number of such priests including him may be as large as 36.</p>

			<p>The attempts at reconciling Brahman the Absolute with the world which is imperfect and limited have resulted in the &#x2018;doctrine of adhyāropa-apavāda.&#x2019; The problem is sought to be resolved by considering the world as an adhyāropa or adhyāsa, a superimposition (even as a snake is superimposed on a rope resulting in illusory perception) and denying it absolute reality. The process of desuperimposition called &#x2018;apavāda,&#x2019; consists of negating the illusory appearances by adopting the right means of knowledge and perceiving the truth as it is. Adhyāropa is practically the same as &#x2018;adhyāsa&#x2019; (See <ref>ADHYĀSA</ref>.) A slight shade of difference in meaning is perhaps, that adhyāropa refers to the process and adhyāsa is the result.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Advaita Vedānta philosophy, the chief exponent of which was Śaṅkara (A.D. 788-820), accepts Brahman (the Absolute), which is beyond names, forms, attributes, and hence, defies all description, as the Ultimate Reality. But the world that we perceive with its myriad names, forms and attributes, circumscribed by time, space and causation, cannot be easily brushed aside or wished away. Hence there is a great need to explain the relationship between Brahman the Absolute and this world of phenomena. &#x2018;Adhyāsa&#x2019; or &#x2018;adhyāropa&#x2019; is the explanation offered by Advaita Vedānta.</p>
			<p>Literally, the word means one thing &#x2018;sitting upon&#x2019; another, hiding its nature for the time being. It is defined as &#x2018;the appearance elsewhere, as in memory, of something perceived earlier.&#x2019; (<em>Adhyāsa-bhāṣya</em> of Śaṅkara, <em>Brahmasūtras</em> 1.1.1). Two oft-repeated analogies are the erroneous perception of a snake in a rope in insufficient light and of silver in nacre shining in light. In both cases, the impressions of a snake and silver from an earlier idea of the same are superimposed on the rope and the nacre under conditions conducive to the erroneous perception. These erroneous perceptions have been caused by the &#x2018;adhyāsa&#x2019; of the snake on the rope and the silver on the nacre. This again is due to ajñāna or avidyā (ignorance) of the real nature of the adhiṣṭhāna (substratum—here, the rope and the nacre). This ajñāna is anādi (without beginning) since it has no ascertainable beginning. Once this ajñāna is removed by right perception, the error disappears automatically.</p>
			<p>Using the doctrine of adhyāsa and the two analogies already mentioned, Advaita metaphysics tries to explain that the world palpably perceived by the senses is only an erroneous perception caused by adhyāsa on Brahman. Once the real nature of Brahman is realised, the world appearance ceases. At the subjective level, this adhyāsa causes the erroneous perception of the body-mind complex on the ātman (the immanent aspect of Brahman at the individual level). Once the real nature of the ātman is realised, its identification with the body-mind complex will disappear.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In the Upaniṣads as well as in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> the three words adhibhūta, adhidaiva and adhyātma are frequently met with. The indeclinable &#x2018;adhi&#x2019; has the sense of &#x2018;ruling over,&#x2019; &#x2018;pertaining to&#x2019;. The word &#x2018;ātman&#x2019; is often used in the sense of the body. Hence &#x2018;adhyātma&#x2019; generally indicates the Self within the body which resides in it and rules over it. It is also used to indicate Brahman or the Supreme Self.</p>
			<p>The word is also used as an adjective and in combination with other words. For instance: adhyātmavidyā (knowledge of the Self), adhyātmayoga (yoga or meditation on the Self).</p>

			<p>Mind is the basic instrument for gaining knowledge and wisdom. Controlling its vagaries and making it flow in a concentrated manner is the best means of attaining knowledge in any field. This however is easier said than done. By a long and arduous process of yogic discipline which includes the practice of ethical principles like ahiṁsā (non-violence), satya (truth) and brahmacarya (continence) and the practice of concentration by stages, the mind loses all its dross and impurities and becomes placid and pellucid. Such a state of mind is called &#x2018;adhyātma-prasāda&#x2019; (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 1.47). In this state the mind, being rid of all impurities that distract and disturb it, has become like a pure crystal capable of reflecting the consciousness of the puruṣa (the Self), in full measure. Such a mind can produce instant knowledge of any object towards which it is directed.</p>

			<word>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hindu life will lose all its meaning and charm without Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, the two colossuses that have strode the Hindu heart for the last few millennia. If the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> of Vālmikī has been the basis on which the Rāma personality has been built up, no less important are its numerous imitations and adoptions that have kept alive the Rāma cult and the Rāma community leading to the development of Rāmālogy. Perhaps, one of the most important Sanskrit works of this type is the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> which is very popular in North India, not only among the devotees of Rāma but also among the Vedāntins. In fact, it is this work that provided Tulasīdāsa with the inspiration to compose his immortal work, the <em>Rāmacaritmānasa</em>.</p>
			<p>Though depicted as a part of the <em>Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa</em>, respected as a canonical work of the Vaiṣṇavas and begun in the Tantra style of conversation between Śiva Mahādeva and Pārvatī, scholars ascribe it to the period 14th-15th cent. A.D. Nothing is known of the author, though the Rāma tradition believes it to be Vedavyāsa since it is said to be an integral part of the <em>Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>Like its original source, the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> also has seven kāṇḍas or books, named in the same manner, except for the sixth, the <em>Yuddhakāṇḍa</em>, which is sometimes designated <em>Laṅkākāṇḍa</em>. The total number of verses is 4200 spread over 65 sargas or chapters. Written in mellifluous Sanskrit, the work admirably sums up the main events of the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> of Vālmīki omitting only the minor details, or descriptions of war and nature. On the other hand new material pertaining to Vedānta philo-sophy, the cult of bhakti in general and Rāma-bhakti in particular and several hymns in praise of Rāma have been liberally added.</p>
			<p>A few of the changes and innovations made, departing from the original may be noted here: The major alteration in the facts of the story is the introduction of a shadow Sītā throughout the period of her abduction, the real Sītā having disappeared into the fire just before the golden deer episode. She re-emerges from the fire at the end of the war when the shadow Sītā enters into it. The whole drama is preplanned and enacted at the bidding of Rāma himself (<em>vide</em> 3.7). Other alterations though minor in nature, are: the earth accompanies the gods in the form of a cow (1.2); Sumitrā gets more of the sacred pudding than Kausalyā and Kaikeyī (1.3); Ahalyā after being cursed by her husband, the sage Gautama, becomes a stone (1.5); Rāvaṇa treats Sītā with the respect due to a mother (3.7.65); Rāma establishes a Śivaliṅga at the site of the bridge to Laṅkā (6.4.1-2).</p>
			<p>Coming to the additions to Vālmikī&#x2019;s story, five paurāṇic episodes need be mentioned: the stories about Vālmīki himself (2.6), Śuka (6.5) and Kālanemi (6.6) who warn Rāvaṇa about Rāma&#x2019;s divinity and the need to propitiate him, Vālī and Sugrīva (7.3). The dialogue between Rāvaṇa and Sanatkumāra is another addition (7.3).</p>
			<p>But the major contribution of the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> lies in its casting of Rāma in the role of a spiritual teacher and in the several exquisite hymns sung in praise of Rāma. There are four occasions when Rāma assumes the role of the teacher and gives philosophic disquisitions. In response to Lakṣmaṇa&#x2019;s questions on three different occasions he teaches know-ledge, devotion, detachment (<em>vide</em> 3.4), methods of worship (4.4) and the way of emancipation (7.5). In reply to Kausalyā&#x2019;s query, he teaches the three yogas of karma, jñāna and bhakti (7.7).</p>
			<p>The well-known <em>Rāmagītā</em> is part of the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> and is the teaching given to Lakṣmaṇa on the last occasion already referred to (7.5). It contains a rather strong dose of Advaita Vedānta though couched in beautiful poetry. In fact some scholars feel that this <em>Rāmagītā</em> and<em> Rāmahṛdaya</em> (1.1) were independent works incorporated later into this <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>As regards the laudatory hymns, we find quite a good number of them: by Brahmā (1.2; 6.13), Kausalyā (1.3), Nārada (2.1), Vālmīki (2.6), Jaṭāyu (3.8), Vibhīṣaṇa (6.6) and all the gods (6.15).</p>
			<p>However the real contribution of this work is in its repeatedly propounding the doctrine that Rāma is Brahman the Absolute and that Sītā is his Māyāśakti or Prakṛti, thereby raising the personality of Rāma to the highest level and providing a firm base to the cult of Rāma. No occasion that gives a chance to do this is missed. Not only sages, gods and devotees, but even the enemies of Rāma—not excepting Rāvaṇa himself !—recognise his divinity and divine mission. Their only duty is to cooperate in the cosmic play of the Divine and be blessed. This task has been admirably fulfilled by the book.</p>
			<p>In the orthodox circles of Rāma devotees, the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em>, is considered to be a mantraśāstra, a sacred book, each stanza of which is revered as a &#x2018;mantra&#x2019; (mystic syllable) and devoutly repeated in a ceremonial way.</p>
			<p>It is worthwhile noting that the well-known Hindi work, <em>Rāmcaritamānas</em> of Tulsīdas (A. D. 1532-1623), is based almost entirely on the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em>.</p>

			<word>Adhyātma Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Upaniṣads are the treasurehouse of the spiritual knowledge of India. They have been accepted and venerated as basic scriptures by most of the religio-philosophical schools of India. Every philo-sopher or religious reformer has taken pains to show that his views are rooted in the Upaniṣadic traditions, or at least, do not go against them. Even the non-Hindu and non-Indian savants have heaped praises on their enlightened views.</p>
			<p>The ten Upaniṣads on which Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) wrote commentaries have universally been accepted as the more ancient, more authentic and authoritative. The <em>Adhyātma Upaniṣad</em>, though outside this list, still, breathes the spirit of the more ancient and the major Upaniṣads.</p>
			<p>Since the printed texts give the śāntimantra as &#x2018;pūrṇamadaḥ ...&#x2019; it is to be surmised that it belongs to the <em>Śukla Yajurveda</em>. The last verse of the Upaniṣad declares that it was first revealed to the sage Apāntaratamas who taught it to Brahmā. Brahmā gave it to Ghora Aṅgiras who in turn transmitted the same to Raikva. Raikva passed it on to Rāma and Rāma revealed it to all the living beings.</p>
			<p>The teaching itself has been designated as &#x2018;nirvāṇānuśāsanam&#x2019; (&#x2018;command concerning final emancipation&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>The text consists of 70 verses, all in the śloka metre, and has not been divided into sub-sections. But there is a method and order in the dealing of the subject matter. It starts with the description of the antarātman, the Innermost Self, the same as Adhyātman, (hence the name <em>Adhyātma Upaniṣad</em>) who exists in all things and beings controlling them from within, but whom none of them knows. He has also been called &#x2018;Nārāyaṇa&#x2019; here (verse 1). After declaring that the sense of &#x2018;I&#x2019; and &#x2018;mine&#x2019; with regard to the body and the senses which are anātman or non-Self, arises due to adhyāsa or superimposition by ignorance, the Upaniṣad exhorts us to get rid of this adhyāsa by being devoted to Brahman and through discrimination. The line of arguments to be pursued in this is practically the same as in Advaita Vedānta (v. 2-11). This is followed by a description of the ātman-Brahman principle as the one without a second, and without internal distinctions. The disciple is asked to see It as his own Self (v. 12-27). Renunciation leads to intuitive knowledge which results in the withdrawal of the mind into itself. Resting it on the ātman, one attains infinite peace and joy or realization. This is the next topic (v. 28 and 29). Then, the identity between the jīva (individual soul) and Brahman (the Cosmic Soul) is shown by negating the accidental characteristics like association with the mind and the māyā-power (v.30-32) followed by a delineation of the three sādhanās or practices, śravaṇa (hearing), manana (reflection) and nididhyāsana (meditation) resulting in samādhi (superconscious experience) (v. 33-35). Then, there is the description of &#x2018;dharma-megha-samādhi,&#x2019; &#x2018;the samādhi which results in kaivalya or liberation&#x2019; (v. 36-43). This is followed by a nice pen-picture of the jīvanmukta, one who is liberated even while living in the body (v. 44-47). He is never affected by the vicissitudes of life and is ever in equipoise. Then the Upaniṣad says that the knowledge of the ātman destroys all the previously accumulated karmas, except the prārabdha-karma which has already begun to fructify. It can be exhausted only through experience. However, the liberated soul is unaffected by it (v. 48-60). It ends with a poetic description of the personal experience of the jīvanmukta (v. 61-69).</p>
			<p>This Upaniṣad is sometimes called <em>Turīyātīta Avadhūta Upaniṣad</em> also.</p>

			<p>The Hindu sages have always advocated mokṣa (liberation from transmi- gration) as the parama-puruṣārtha (the highest goal to be achieved by man) and have recommended adhyātmavidyā as the means of achieving it. Adhyātmavidyā is the science that leads one to the realization of the Self within. It is the knowledge and wisdom taught in the Upaniṣads, the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> and other works which follow them. A study of these books under enlightened teachers will lead to a clear understanding of the ātman or the Self and meditation on this understanding will ultimately lead to realization. Parā-vidyā and brahmavidyā are other words often used as synonyms for this. It is the highest knowledge and the only one worth seeking in life. Hence in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, Lord Kṛṣṇa goes to the extent of identifying himself with it (<em>vide</em> 10.31).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Study of the Vedas, technically termed &#x2018;adhyayana,&#x2019; was considered not only as part of education but as part of religious life as well. Since a change of svara (intonation) would often entail a change of meaning as well, great care was exercised in preserving the oral musical tradition of the Vedas.</p>
			<p>The student desirous of learning the Vedas had to live in the house of the guru, after first completing the sacrament of upanayana. Avoiding the days known as &#x2018;anadhyayana&#x2019; (or anadhyāya) (See <ref>ANADHYĀYA</ref>.) on all other permissible days he could approach the guru for Vedic studies after finishing the daily religious chores like the sandhyā. He had to sit facing north. The guru would recite the Vedic mantras pāda by pāda (i.e., a quarter of a stanza) and the student had to repeat them at least twice. Once he learnt the correct pronunciation and intonation and also committed it to memory, the guru would proceed with the next part. The student had to revise the lessons by himself or with the help of senior students the same day. The study would cover the Saṁhitā, the Brāhmaṇa and the Upaniṣad parts of the particular śākhā (branch) of the Veda to which the student belonged. It would normally take twelve years to master one&#x2019;s śākhā.</p>
			<p>Along with the Vedic studies, a study of the Vedāṅgas (subsidiaries like grammar) dharmaśāstras, itihāsas and purāṇas as also some secular sciences would also be pursued.</p>
			<p>As for teaching (adhyāpana), it was expected that the teacher (adhyāpaka or ācārya) should be well-versed and competent and of a sinless life. He could teach anyone eligible for Vedic studies, on any of the following three conditions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>as dharma, as part of his duties;</li>
				<li>for artha or wealth, if the student promised it beforehand;</li>
				<li>as a reward for śuśrūṣā or personal service. He was not expected to teach if none of these conditions was fulfilled.</li>

Considered as a minor manifestation, he is described in iconographical works as sitting upon the serpent Ādiśeṣa, with the right leg hanging and the left as folded and resting upon the seat. Of the four hands, the two back hands hold as usual, the śaṅkha (conch) and cakra (discus). The front right hand rests upon the seat whereas the front left is supported on the folded left knee. The colour of the figure is coral red and it is richly decorated with ornaments. The other two gods of the Trinity, Brahmā and Śiva, as also the sages Bhṛgu and Mārkaṇḍeya are also shown, in a reveren-tial aspect.</p>

			<p>The esoteric Nātha cult which originated in Bengal and the followers of which are found in some parts of North India considers the Supreme Being as elusive and intangible, and as manifested in the universe created out of him. It designates him as &#x2018;Ādinātha.&#x2019; Following in the footsteps of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (10.129) and the opening verse of <em>Manusaṁhitā</em>, the Nātha cult describes the beginning of creation as starting from a bubble or an egg which appeared as a result of the impulse for creation in the infinite void and all- encompassing darkness. The egg hatched and out of it emerged &#x2018;Ādinātha&#x2019; the primeval God. From his sweat was produced his spouse Ketakā or Manasā who in turn created Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. Further creation proceeded out of them.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Every religion has three aspects: philosophy, mythology and rituals. While philosophy tries to find solutions to the ultimate questions and problems of life, mythology tries to explain the truths discovered by it, through stories, allegories and examples. The Hindu mythological lore, designated &#x2018;purāṇa,&#x2019; does this and much more. It gives whole systems of knowledge in various fields whether allied to or even remotely connected with philo-sophy, or not. The <em>Ādipurāṇa</em> is one of the purāṇas often included in the lists.</p>
			<p>According to one tradition, it is the original purāṇa, as its very name implies, composed by Brahmā the Creator himself.</p>
			<p>Comprising four hundred thousand verses, it is the source book for all the other purāṇas written by Vyāsa. The book however is not available now.</p>
			<p>Among the extant purāṇas, the <em>Brahmapurāṇa</em> is occasionally designated as <em>Ādipurāṇa</em> also. One <em>Ādipurāṇa</em> is sometimes listed among the minor purāṇas known as upapurāṇas. This book, now available in print is obviously a much later work. It is mainly the story of Kṛṣṇa.</p>
			<p>The Jaina tradition (digambara sect) also has an <em>Ādipurāṇa</em>, an incomplete work by one Jinasena, a part of which was added on later by another author Guṇabhadra. It describes the stories of Ṛṣabhadeva and Bharata, the first two Tīrthaṅkaras.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The source and sustenance of all creation whether at the level of matter, mind or life, is one. It is called Śakti (power or energy). Hinduism posits a cyclic theory of creation (sṛṣṭi), preservation (sthiti) and destruction (pralaya) and this goes on eternally. It is the Śakti of God that is responsible for this. This Śakti is usually conceived as a female deity, as the Consort of God. Since she is the original source, she is often called &#x2018;Ādiśakti,&#x2019; the Primeval Power.</p>
			<p>It is the Śaiva and Śākta Āgama works that propound this theory of Śakti, and She is fully identified with Pārvatī, Śiva&#x2019;s Consort. Māyā (the illusory power of God) of Vedānta and Durgā of the purāṇas are also called Ādiśakti since they also are identified with Pārvatī.</p>

			<p>In the Hindu mythological literature, Ādiśeṣa is described as a mighty serpent of a thousand hoods on which he is supporting the world. He forms the bed on which Lord Nārāyaṇa is reclining. Ananta, Anantanāga, Śeṣa and Śeṣanāga are his other names. Born as the son of Kadru and Kaśyapa he later on dropped out of the company of his brother-serpents since they illtreated his step-mother Vinatā who was a good and noble woman. He pleased Brahmā, the Creator, by severe austerities and obtained the boon of the power to support the world on his hoods. Lord Nārāyaṇa was pleased to make him his couch. Lakṣmaṇa and Balarāma, the brothers of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, are said to be the incarnations of Ādiśeṣa. So also Patañjali, the promulgator of the Yoga system of philosophy.</p>
			<p>It is obvious that this is a highly allegorical and symbolical picture. Ādiśeṣa really stands for cosmic time and space which are &#x2018;ananta,&#x2019; endless or infinite. Hence, the myth of Ādiśeṣa supporting the world on his thousand hoods signifies that the created world comes into being in the infinite time and space and is sustained by them. The thousand hoods stand for the innumerable divisions of time and space.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;śeṣa&#x2019; means &#x2018;what is left over&#x2019;, &#x2018;the remainder&#x2019;. Since creation cannot proceed out of nothing, it is to be assumed that &#x2018;something&#x2019; is left over (śeṣa) from the previous cycle of creation. So Śeṣa represents the totality of jīvas or individual souls in their subtle forms left over from the previous cycle and needing more opportunities for redemption.</p>
			<p>The serpent usually stands for kāma or desire, which is always left over (śeṣa) even after acquiring and enjoying the desired object. Hence in a cosmic sense it can stand for the desire of the Lord to proceed with the next cycle of creation after rest.</p>
			<p>Lord Nārāyaṇa reclining upon the serpent couch can mean that desire for creation as also time and space form the basis, resting on which he proceeds with creation.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Aditi, the &#x2018;devamātā&#x2019; (mother of the gods) is one of the few goddesses mentioned in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> and other Vedic literature. She is often associated with Diti, her sister, and mother of the daityas (demons). She is eulogised as the boundless and identified with practically everything in the created world. She is the sky and the air. The three aspects of time are also she. She has become all the human beings, nay, even the gods. She is the mother and she is the father too. That is why supplications are made to her to confer her blessings on children and cattle as also for the removal of sins (<em>vide Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 1.89.10).</p>
			<p>In the mythological lore of the Vedas she is usually described as one of the daughters of Dakṣa, though sometimes she is said to be his mother. There are also passages which mention her as the wife of Viṣṇu instead of Kaśyapa. However according to most of the accounts she was married to the sage Kaśyapa for whom she bore several sons. The gods being her sons are called Āditeyas. Sometimes the eight Ādityas are described as her sons. Out of these eight, she is said to have cast out the last son Mārttaṇḍa.</p>
			<p>Coming to the Upaniṣads, the word &#x2018;Aditi&#x2019; is used to denote death, the devourer (ad to devour) (<em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> 1.2.5), and the deity presiding over the earth (<em>Mahānārayaṇa Upaniṣad</em> 28.1) as also the jīvātman or the individual soul (<em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> 4.7).</p>
			<p>In the epics and the purāṇas she is always depicted as the daughter of Dakṣa, wife of Kaśyapa and mother of gods including the Vāmana incarnation of Viṣṇu. Indra is said to have picked up a pair of divine kuṇḍalas (ear-rings) as they were thrown up by the churning of the primeval ocean (See <ref>SAMUDRAMATHANA</ref>) and presented them to Aditi. But the demon Narakāsura Bhauma (the son of Bhūmi or earth) stole them from her. It was Kṛṣṇa who recovered and restored them to her.</p>
			<p>Aditi is also the name of a place of pilgrimage on the bank of the river Gaṅgā.</p>

			<p>Āditya is one of the well-known epithets of the sun.</p>
			<p>The Ādityas, the sons of Aditi, repre-sent a group of deities. They are six in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, eight in most of the Brāhmaṇas (except the <em>Śatapatha</em>) and twelve in the later mythological lore. They can be described as the personifications of the laws that rule the universe and the human society. They regulate the relationships of human beings among themselves and with the forces of nature.</p>
			<p>Since Āditya is one of the names of the sun, the Ādityas can be considered as imperishable beings, the gods of light, by whom all kinds of luminous life are manifested and sustained in this universe.</p>
			<p>The twelve Ādityas are: Mitra (the friend), Varuṇa (one who encompasses and binds), Aryaman (the destroyer of foes), Dakṣa (the skilful), Bhaga (the giver), Aṁśa (the liberal), Tvaṣṭṛ (the shaper), Savitṛ (the vivifier), Pūṣan (the nourisher), Śakra (the mighty), Vivasvat (the resplendent) and Viṣṇu (the pervader).</p>
			<p>Sometimes, these twelve are linked with the twelve aspects of the sun spread over the twelve months and hence des-cribed as the twelve spokes of the wheel of time.</p>

			<p>Every Hindu has to undergo certain saṁskāras or sacraments—religious rites conducive to inner evolution—at various stages of his life. The dharmaśāstras list them as sixteen; hence the name &#x2018;ṣodaśa-saṁskāras&#x2019; (ṣodaśa 16). One such ṣaṁskāra called &#x2018;niṣkramaṇa&#x2019; (lit., &#x2018;going out&#x2019;) consists of taking the baby outside the lying-in chamber for the first time, to see the sun. This is &#x2018;āditya-darśana.&#x2019; For details see <ref>NIṢKRAMAṆA</ref>.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu hymnal literature is as vast as it is deep. Quite a few of these hymns, whether they contain praises of the Lord or expound some philosophical doctrines, are often used for ceremonial chanting, considering them as mantras (esoteric words and sentences) capable of fulfilling one&#x2019;s desires. The <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> of Vālmīki, though a voluminuous work, strangely enough, contains only one such hymn; strangely enough because, the <em>Mahā-bhārata</em>, the other epic, as also the purāṇas contain scores of them. This hymn known as the &#x2018;Ādityahṛdaya&#x2019; occurs in the <em>Yuddhakāṇḍa</em> (sarga 105).</p>
			<p>After the first round of battle with Rāvaṇa, Rāma was rather tired and anxious as to how he could vanquish his formidable enemy. Just at that time, Agastya the sage of the Vindhya fame, who was among those that had gathered to witness the battle, came forward to reveal a secret with the help of which Rāma could conquer Rāvaṇa and fulfil the mission of his life. The secret was the <em>Ādityahṛdaya</em> hymn by reciting which he could get enough power to destroy his foe. Being initiated into its mysteries by Agastya, Rāma recited it thrice, became imbued with energy and enthusiasm and achieved victory with ease.</p>
			<p>Whether the <em>Ādityahṛdaya</em> comprises the entire chapter or part of it only (e.g., verses 6 to 21) is a point on which there are differences of opinion. Verses 1 to 5 form the introduction and eulogise the hymn. Verses 6 to 21 describe Āditya or the Sun-god, his various names and attributes. Verses 22 to 25 describe his power and give the phalaśruti (the benefits of recitation). Verse 26 gives the viniyoga (the method and purpose of recitation). Verses 27 to 31 complete the narration of the story.</p>
			<p>Here are a few of the epithets which the hymn uses to describe and eulogise Āditya: He is so effulgent that even the gods adore him. In fact he is the very personification of all gods including the Trinity. It is he that is manifested as the leaders of the eight quarters. He is the creator and sustainer of the world. It is again he that destroys the world at the end of the cycle of creation. He is manifested in everything that is created.</p>
			<p>The proper recitation of the hymn will free a man from all troubles and tribulations and fulfil the wishes of his heart.</p>
			<p>Every mantra has a ṛṣi (the seer to whom it was revealed), a chandas (the poetical metre) and a devatā (the deity to whom it is addressed), who are to be adored at the beginning of a ceremonial recitation. In the case of this hymn (which is considered as a mantra), Agastya is the ṛṣi and anuṣṭubh is the chandas. As regards the devatā, some state that Brahmā residing in the sun is the deity whereas others consider Rāma the Supreme God, the internal ruler of the sun, is himself the deity. The viniyoga or purpose is to obtain supreme knowledge or victory in all walks of life.</p>
			<p>Any Sunday on which there is a saṅkrānti (movement of the sun from one zodiacal sign to the next) is believed to be very holy and suitable for the recitation of this hymn. Repeating it 108 times in a Sun-temple and observing a fast in the night are considered to be highly meritorious.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Purāṇas or the mythological lore of the Hindus are a vast body of literature dealing with not only philosophical and religious subjects but also cultural and even mundane subjects. They are divided into two broad groups: The Mahāpurāṇas (the great, big or main purāṇas) and the Upapurāṇas (small or subsidiary purāṇas). <em>Ādityapurāṇa</em>, a purāṇa dealing with the deity Āditya (Sun-god), is often mentioned in the latter group. The book itself is not available now, except for some quotations incorporated by the dharmaśāstra literature. These quotations concern the following subjects: rājadharma (duties of the king), dāna (gifts), śrāddha (obsequial offerings), vrata (religious vows and obser- vances) and śauca (ceremonial purity).</p>
			<p>The <em>Matsyapurāṇa</em> (53.62) as also Al Beruni (A. D. 1030) mention this purāṇa.</p>

			<p>Vratas or religious vows and observances are a common form of practical religion in Hinduism. These vratas are undertaken either for fulfilling a desire with divine intervention or for expiating sin or even as observing a spiritual discipline.</p>
			<p>The Ādityaśāntivrata can be observed on any Sunday associated with the Hastā-nakṣatra. Worshipping the image of the Sun with 28 or 108 fuel sticks of the arka plant (<em>Calatropis gigantea</em>) is the main part of the ritual. These fuel sticks are to be offered with honey and ghee (or ghee and curds) in homa (fire sacrifice). The vrata can be repeated seven times.</p>

			<p>Places of pilgrimage have always played a very important part in the life of a devout Hindu. Endowed with natural beauty and conducive to peace and blessed-ness these places have been attracting millions of pious pilgrims since millennia.</p>
			<p>Ādityatīrtha is one of the less known places of pilgrimage mentioned in some of the Hindu scriptures (<em>vide Śalyaparva</em>, ch. 49 of <em>Mahābhārata</em>). Situated on the bank of the now invisible Sarasvatī river, the place got its name on account of its association with Āditya (Sun) who performed a sacrifice there and obtained lordship over all bright objects. It was here that Lord Viṣṇu killed the demons Madhu and Kaiṭabha.</p>
			<p>Again it was in this sacred place that great sages like Vyāsa, Kṛṣṇa and Śuka performed austerities and gained perfection.</p>
			<p>The <em>Padmapurāṇa</em> locates it at the confluence of the river Sābhramatī with the sea.</p>

			<p>A brahmacārin (celibate student) living in the house of the ācārya (preceptor) had to observe several vratas (religious observances) as part of the student-life. Whenever the study of new sections of the Vedas had to be commenced he had to prepare himself physically and mentally for the same. For instance the followers of <em>Sāmaveda</em> were required to perform five vratas before studying its several sections: godānika, vrātika, āditya, aupaniṣada and jyeṣṭhasāma vratas.</p>
			<p>Ādityavrata was considered as optional by some authorities, whereas the other vratas were compulsory. It had to be performed before beginning the study of the śukriya section (last part of the Āraṇyaka) of the Sāmaveda.</p>
			<p>Before beginning the vrata nāndī-mukha-śrāddha (See <ref>ĀBHYUDAYIKA ŚRĀDDHA</ref>.) had to be performed and upanayana saṁskāra had to be undergone once again, followed by ājyahoma (offering ghee into the fire) with Āditya mantras. During the period of the vrata which lasted for a year, the brahmacārin had to wear only one cloth and avoid taking protection against the sun&#x2019;s rays by contrivances like umbrella. Of course, taking shelter in the house or under trees was allowed. Also, he was prohibited from entering into more than knee-deep water, for bath. The vrata had to be concluded with offering caru (porridge of unpounded rice) to Indra, repeating the ājyahoma and gifting a cow to the ācārya (preceptor).</p>

			<p>The population of the Ādivāsīs, the original inhabitants of India or aboriginals—that is what the name signifies—exceeds thirty million. They are primarily to be found in north-east India, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Maharashtra, Deccan and South India. How many of them are really the &#x2018;original&#x2019; inhabitants and how many have come as migrants is anybody&#x2019;s guess. The various tribes of Ādivāsīs largely inhabiting the mountain and jungle areas differ widely from one another with regard to racial characteristics, language, food habits, modes of dress, means of occupation as also their cult and culture. By and large they are treated as belonging to Hindu culture.</p>
			<p>Their religious beliefs and observances include the worship of nature and totems as also their ancestors and spirits. Taboos are many. Bloody sacrifices are common. Priests are sorcerers too and have a tight grip over the community. Modern education, wherever it has percolated, is fast changing the complexion of their life style.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Indian systems of metaphysics known as &#x2018;darśanas&#x2019; invariably deal with three topics: Pramā (valid knowledge), pramāṇa (means of valid knowledge) and prameya (objects of valid knowledge)</p>
			<p>The Viśiṣṭādvaita Darśana, one of the important schools of Vedānta, whose chief exponent was Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) categorises prameya into two broad groups of &#x2018;dravya&#x2019; (substance) and &#x2018;adravya&#x2019; (nonsubstance).</p>
			<p>If dravya acts as a substratum or locus of change, adravya is an attribute or quality always necessarily dependent on dravya. Neither dravya nor adravya can be thought of apart from the other.</p>
			<p>The adravyas are ten: sattva, rajas and tamas (the three guṇas or qualities of prakṛti or insentient nature); śabda (sound), sparśa (touch), rūpa (colour or form), rasa (taste) and gandha (odour) being the five characteristic qualities of the five bhūtas like ākāśa (ether); saṁyoga (conjunction or external relation between substances) and śakti (potency or the effecting agency in all causal substances as for instance, plasticity in clay or the power of attraction in a magnet).</p>
			<p>According to Viśiṣṭādvaita, instances can be given where an adravya can be viewed both as a substance and as an attribute. For example, though light is an attribute of an effulgent object, it serves also as a substance, since it is subject to contraction and diffusion, and possesses colour as an attribute. Dharmabhūtajñāna is another example.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Human efforts, however great, often end in failure or only in partial success. The reason is that there is an unseen (adṛṣṭa) power that is guiding human destinies. Success or failure depends on the consonance or otherwise of this power with our efforts. This belief in an unseen power is common to almost all the religious groups.</p>
			<p>Most of the Hindu religious works use this word in the sense of &#x2018;karma&#x2019; or fate (the consequence of actions, good or bad, done in the previous lives). The word is sometimes used to indicate only merit, accruing to the performer of good deeds. Some schools use it in the sense of blind destiny also.</p>
			<p>The Pūrva-mīmāṁsā system however employs it in a technical sense as equivalent to &#x2018;apūrva,&#x2019; the unseen effect of sacrificial rites producing the desired results for the performer in his future life.</p>
			<p>Adṛṣṭa resides in the subtle body of the soul unfolding its results at the appropriate time in future or in future life. Its power is irresistible and incompre- hensible by ordinary consciousness.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At a time when the common masses of India were oppressed by the fanatical Muslim rulers on one side and the tyranny of the caste system on the other, the Bhakti Movement (the Hindu spiritual renaissance through bhakti or devotion to God) started and sustained by a galaxy of great spiritual leaders from Rāmānuja to Caitanya (11th to 16th centuries A. D.) came as a great saviour. One of the important predecessors and a senior contemporary of Caitanya was Advaitācārya (16th Century A. D.) also known as Advaita or Advaita Prabhu. Not much is known of him. He was a resident of Śāntipur and a disciple of Mādhavendra Purī. It was in his house that Caitanya met his mother Śacī Devī for the first time after taking to the monastic life, and decided to stay at Purī (Orissa) for the rest of his life in deference to her wish.</p>
			<p>Even before Viśvambhar—that is how Caitanya was known in his premonastic days—was acclaimed as a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa by the contemporary Vaiṣṇava leaders, Advaitācārya had had visions of him as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa himself.</p>
			<p>According to the theology developed by the later Caitanya school, Advaitācārya was an aspect of Viṣṇu.</p>

			<p>If Hindu philosophical systems have grown both in width and depth revealing power and energy, it is not a little due to the freedom of thought enjoyed by the various writers. It was perhaps Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) the doyen of Advaita Vedānta who initiated and also gave a fillip to voluminous writing on abstruse philosophical subjects. Criticism, defence and counter-criticism of his views by sub- sequent writers gave rise to a phenomenal growth of Vedānta literature. When Vyāsa Tīrtha, a pontiff of the Mādhva school (15th-16th cent. A. D.) caused a jolt to Advaita metaphysics by his well-known polemical work <em>Nyāyāmṛta</em>, the Advaita tradition met his challenge through the <em>Advaitasiddhi</em>, the most celebrated work of Madhusūdana Sarasvatī (16th cent. A. D.).</p>
			<p>The point of dispute between the two works is the definition of what is true (satya) and what is false (mithyā). Any object is considered as satya (true, real) only as long as it is not bādhita (contradicted or negated) by subsequent experience. All the criticisms of <em>Nyāyāmṛta</em> against the five definitions of falsity given by the previous writers on Advaita have been met by the <em>Advaitasiddhi</em>. The book also discusses and supports many of the conflicting theories regarding the unity or plurality of the selves, unity or plurality of avidyā (nescience), Brahman or the jīva as the locus of avidyā thereby implying that any of the theories can be resorted to in explaining the indeterminable false world since the main interest of the advaitin is the one absolute Brahman. The different theories of Advaita can be adopted by the different aspirants according to their fitness (adhikāra).</p>
			<p>The work has three Sanskrit commen- taries of which <em>Laghucandrikā</em> of Brahmā-nanda Sarasvatī is popular among the scholars.</p>

			<h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
			<p>Man is often described as a rational animal. Once the animal in him is reasonably satisfied by the provision of basic biological and some psychological needs, the rational part gets an opportunity to evolve to higher levels. Philosophy including metaphysics is one of the highest aspects of this evolution.</p>
			<h2>DARŚANAS</h2>
			<p>The Indian philosophical systems have developed not only as a result of intellectual speculation but also of mystical intuition. Hence the name &#x2018;darśana&#x2019; (lit., &#x2018;seeing&#x2019;), usually applied to them. The topics most commonly discussed by these darśanas are generally four:</p>
			<ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>nature of the physical world, its origin and evolution;</li>
				<li>nature of man and other living beings;</li>
				<li>existence of God, his nature and attributes;</li>
				<li>the goal of human life and the way of attaining it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Different standpoints and differing views of these topics of discussion have naturally led to a variety of schools. These schools are broadly divided into two classes: the āstika and the nāstika. The former accept the authority of the Vedas whereas the latter do not.</p>
			<h2>VEDĀNTA DARŚANA</h2>
			<p>The Vedānta Darśana is the last of the former schools but has gained the most important place among them. A judicious combination of reasoning and acceptance of the authority of the Vedas as also a long unbroken tradition are responsible for its gaining the pre-eminent place.</p>
			<p>Though the &#x2018;prasthānatraya&#x2019; (&#x2018;the three great paths&#x2019;) viz., the Upaniṣads, the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> and the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, are the basis of the Vedānta Darśana, it is the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> (also called <em>Vedānta-sūtras</em> and <em>Śārīrakasūtras</em>) of Bādarāyaṇa-Vyāsa that occupies the key position. The sūtras (aphorisms) being quite terse and often ambiguous have naturally led to widely differing interpretations, resulting in the three well-known systems of Vedānta viz., Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Vedānta&#x2019; itself means the &#x2018;end or the essence of the Vedas.&#x2019; It is the Upaniṣads that mainly comprise the Vedānta since they normally form the last part of the Vedic literature and contain the quintessence of their teachings.</p>
			<h2>ADVAITA VEDĀNTA</h2>
			<p>The Advaita Vedānta Darśana owes its systematisation as a formidable doctrine, to Gauḍapāda (7th-8th cent. A.D.) who wrote his famous Kārikās on the <em>Māṇḍūkyopaniṣad</em> and Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820). Śaṅkara&#x2019;s commentaries on the prasthānatraya as also a few independent treatises form the bedrock on which the later Advaitins built their edifices.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Advaita&#x2019; means &#x2018;non-dual&#x2019;, &#x2018;one without a second&#x2019;. The system derives this nomenclature from the fact that it recognises Brahman (the Absolute) as the only reality and denies permanent reality to the world as also to the individual souls.</p>
			<p>The entire edifice of Advaita metaphysics is built upon the foundation that Brahman is the only reality, &#x2018;brahma satyam&#x2019;. This premise is based firmly on the famous Upaniṣadic statement &#x2018;sadeva somya idamagra āsīt, ekamevādvitīyam.&#x2019; &#x2018;Dear (Śvetaketu), in the beginning (before creation) Reality (or Brahman) alone existed, the one without a second&#x2019; (<em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> 6.2.1). However, the world of multiplicity is a matter of our day-to-day experience. Hence it becomes necessary to offer an explanation as to how Brahman, the one without a second, appears as this world of multiple names and forms. The explanation offered by Advaita is &#x2018;Anirvacanīyakhyāti,&#x2019; its theory of erroneous cognition, which defies logic. (For other theories about erroneous cognition see <ref>KHYĀTIS</ref>.) Perceiving silver in nacre in moonlight or snake in rope in insufficient light are stock examples given by the Advaitins. In both cases there is an erroneous perception brought about by the impressions of silver and snake from an earlier idea of the same, now superimposed upon nacre and rope under conditions favourable to the error. This superimposition called &#x2018;adhyāsa&#x2019; or &#x2018;adhyāropa&#x2019;, is responsible for the mithyājñāna (false knowledge) that the object perceived is silver or snake.</p>
			<p>The silver or the snake perceived is neither &#x2018;sat&#x2019; (real) nor &#x2018;asat&#x2019; (unreal). It is not asat or unreal like &#x2018;the son of a barren woman&#x2019; since it is actually perceived. Neither is it sat or real since it disappears as soon as the substratum (the nacre and the rope) is perceived as it is. To explain such a peculiar phenomenon Śaṅkara creates, out of logical necessity, a third type of perceived objects which is &#x2018;sad-asad-vilakṣaṇa&#x2019; (different from both the real and the unreal). The &#x2018;khyāti&#x2019; or the cognition itself is described as &#x2018;anirvacanīya,&#x2019; incapable of any precise definition or description.</p>
			<p>The basic cause of this erroneous perception is termed &#x2018;ajñāna&#x2019; or &#x2018;avidyā&#x2019; (ignorance) which is said to be bhāvarūpa (existent) and is endowed with two śaktis or powers viz., &#x2018;āvaraṇaśakti&#x2019; (veiling power) and &#x2018;vikṣepaśakti&#x2019; (transforming power). It veils the true nature of nacre and rope and shows up silver and snake in their place by apparently transforming them. Such an apparently transformed object is called a &#x2018;vivarta&#x2019; of the original and the theory that propounds this is known as &#x2018;Vivartavāda.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Since this avidyā does not make the nacre and the rope completely disappear from view, but only makes them appear as something else, it is described as bhāvarūpa or existent.</p>
			<p>An attempt may now be made to explain how this world of duality has evolved out of the non-dual Reality called Brahman in the Upaniṣads. The world of duality can be broadly divided into &#x2018;dṛk&#x2019; (the seer) and &#x2018;dṛśya&#x2019; (the seen). Both these again are divided into the innumerable living beings (jīvās) and the countless objects of creation. How does Brahman the Absolute, the One without a second, the indivisible Reality, appear divided into innumerable beings on the one side and countless objects on the other? It is avidyā that causes the one Ātman (the Self)—incidentally, the Upaniṣads use both words, Ātman and Brahman, to indicate the same Reality—appear as many jīvas and it is māyā that causes the world of phenomena. Māyā is avidyā at the cosmic level.</p>
			<p>Śaṅkara accepts three degrees of reality. The first, known as &#x2018;prātibhāsika-satya&#x2019; (apparent truth, illusory appearance) is illustrated in the wrong perception of silver in nacre or snake in rope. The second, called &#x2018;vyāvahārika-satya&#x2019; is illustrated by this world of our day-to-day experience. This world-appearance has a much higher degree of reality and lasts till one gets ātmajñāna or brahmajñāna, realization of the Truth, Ātman-Brahman. It is satya or true for all purposes of vyavahāra i.e., day-to-day existence or practical life. The third, designated as &#x2018;pāramārthika-satya,&#x2019; is the highest Truth and the only truth that really exists. It is Brahman or Ātman, which is nirguṇa (without attributes) and nirākāra (without forms), hence incapable of being described except in a negative way (&#x2018;neti,&#x2019; &#x2018;neti&#x2019;—&#x2018;not this, not this&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>Brahman associated with māyā is Saguṇa Brahman (Brahman with attri-butes) or Īśvara (Lord of creation, God). It is this aspect of Brahman that is responsible for creation, preservation and destruction of the world. As for the actual order of evolution of the created world, the descriptions given in the Upaniṣads are accepted.</p>
			<p>For Śaṅkara who holds that the world process is only a &#x2018;vivarta&#x2019; (illusory appearance) due to adhyāsa (superimposition) on Brahman, the very attempt to describe the various steps of evolution is a futile exercise. However, since the śruti (revealed scripture, the Upaniṣads) has done so, a place of honour must somehow be accorded to it. Hence he characterises such descriptions as giving the &#x2018;taṭastha-lakṣaṇa&#x2019; (accidental or casual charac- teristics) of Brahman helping us to be directed towards it, even as the branch of a tree helps us to locate the crescent in the sky. On the other hand Brahman as it is, can be comprehended only through its &#x2018;svarūpalakṣaṇa&#x2019; (integral or essential characteristics), which is &#x2018;sat-cit-ānanda.&#x2019; &#x2018;Sat&#x2019; (eternal reality), &#x2018;cit&#x2019; (pure consciousness), and &#x2018;ānanda&#x2019; (unalloyed bliss) are not really its characteristics but its very essence.</p>
			<p>This Brahman or Ātman which is sat-cit-ānanda, has inexplicably got itself involved in the body-mind complex, the involvement being due to avidyā. Since the origin of this involvement can never be logically or satisfactorily explained, avidyā is stated to be anādi or beginningless. The involved ātman is designated as &#x2018;jīva.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>This jīva, the ātman in bondage, has five kośas or sheaths (For details see <ref>PAÑCAKOŚAS</ref>.), three śarīras or bodies (See <ref>STHŪLAŚARĪRA</ref>, <ref>SŪKṢMAŚARĪRA</ref> and <ref>KĀRAṆA-ŚARĪRA</ref>.), performs actions motivated by desires, experiences pleasure and pain due to karma and undergoes transmigration (See <ref>KARMA</ref> and <ref>PUNARJANMA</ref>.) until libera- tion. Śaṅkara declares that this jīva, when shorn of its upādhis or limiting adjuncts like the body and the mind, is identical with Brahman, since its essential nature also is sat-cit-ānanda.</p>
			<p>The main trouble with the ātman become jīva is the tādātmya or false identification with the mind and the body brought about by adhyāropa or adhyāsa (superimposition). Hence the only way of remedying it is by apavāda or desuper-imposition, denying this identification. For this, one has first to prepare oneself by the preliminary fourfold discipline or sādhana-catuṣṭaya viz., viveka (discrimination between the eternal and the non-eternal), vairāgya (dispassion), śamādi-ṣaṭka (cultivation of the six virtues like self-control) and mumukṣutva (desire for liberation). (For details see <ref>SĀDHANA-CATUṢṬAYA</ref>.) Then one has to approach a competent guru (spiritual preceptor) and learn the truth from him by śravaṇa (hearing), manana (reflection) and nidi-dhyāsana (contemplation). The most important part of the guru&#x2019;s teaching will be in the form of &#x2018;mahāvākyas&#x2019; (great sentences) like &#x2018;tat tvam asi&#x2019; (That thou art&#x2019;) or &#x2018;ahaṁ brahmāsmi&#x2019; (&#x2018;I am Brahman&#x2019;). (See <ref>MAHĀVĀKYAS</ref> for details.) Śravaṇa and manana produce the deep-rooted conviction that one is the spirit. Hence in nididhyāsana, desuperimposition in the form of &#x2018;I am not the body, nor the sense-organs, nor the mind, nor even the ego&#x2019; and so on, can be practised leading ultimately to the realization that one is the ātman. This realization resulting in mukti or liberation can be had even while one is living in this body. It is known as &#x2018;jīvanmukti.&#x2019; He will attain &#x2018;videhamukti&#x2019; after the body falls off, the continuance of the body between the two states being due to prārabdha-karma. (See <ref>PRĀRABDHA KARMA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>Mukti or liberation from transmigration is not the gaining of a new state but recognising the already existing original state.</p>
			<p>Two kinds of mukti—jīvanmukti and videhamukti—are envisaged in the Advaitic works. The Vivaraṇa school upholds the theory that mukti is simultaneous with jñāna. Hence jīvanmukti is not only possible, but the only mukti that can be recognised. Continuance of the body for some more time, due to prārabdha karma, has no effect upon jñāna. On the other hand, the Bhāmatī school holds that even after jñāna, if the body continues due to prārabdha karma, this imposes a limitation thereby implying the existence of a trace of avidyā. The death of the body puts an end even to this trace of avidyā, and real mukti is obtained then. Since this comes after the death of the body, it is called &#x2018;videhamukti.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>A favourite topic of discussion that frequently crops up in Advaita metaphysical works is the locus of avidyā. Since Brahman is the only reality that exists, it alone is the āśraya (locus) as also the viṣaya (object) of avidyā. This is one school. Sureśvara and Padmapāda are the main protagonists of this school. According to them avidyā is one only.</p>
			<p>Since Brahman is pure consciousness, avidyā can never exist in it nor act on it. This is the opposing school propagated by Vācaspati Miśra. For him, the jīvas are the loci of avidyā and there is one avidyā for every jīva.</p>
			<h2>POST-ŚAṄKARA ADVAITA</h2>
			<p>Though Śaṅkara wrote profusely, clearly enunciating the main doctrines of his school, there are certain places in his writings wherein the important aspects of certain doctrines are either vague or are capable of more than one interpretation. This has naturally, resulted in the growth of quite a voluminous post-Śaṅkara Advaita literature leading to different prasthānas or schools of thought. The &#x2018;Vārttika-prasthāna&#x2019; of Sureśvara (9th cent. A. D.) comes first in the series. This school gets its designation from the exposition contained in the &#x2018;vārttikās&#x2019; or commentaries in verse of Sureśvara on Śaṅkara&#x2019;s bhāṣyas on the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> and the <em>Taittirīya</em> Upaniṣads. According to this school, Brahman is the material cause of this world, and not māyā. The locus of avidyā is Brahman and not the jīvas. Avidyā is one only and not many. The mahāvākyas or the great Vedic dictums are capable of producing immediate cognition of the Self as Brahman. Hence dhyānābhyāsa or practice of meditation on the meaning of those dictums is not necessary. The jīvas are but ābhāsas or appearances of Brahman in the individual minds. (This has earned the theory, the designation of &#x2018;ābhāsavāda&#x2019; as opposed to &#x2018;pratibimbavāda&#x2019; and &#x2018;avaccheda-vāda&#x2019; of other schools.)</p>
			<p>The &#x2018;Vivaraṇaprasthāna&#x2019; of Padma-pāda (9th cent. A. D.) and Prakāśātman (A. D. 1220) comes next. The name is derived from the work <em>Pañcapādikā- vivaraṇa</em> of the latter, it being a voluminous commentary on the <em>Pañcapādikā</em> of Padmapāda, which itself is a commentary on Śaṇkara&#x2019;s Brahmasūtra-bhāsya. Though this name suggests that it covers five pādas or sections of the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, only the commentary on the first four sūtras is now available. The chief doctrines of this school are: Avidyā is a jaḍātmikā śakti (a force of material nature) and is the material cause of this world. It is bhāvarūpa, a positive entity but not real. Māyā, prakṛti, avyakta, avyākṛta, tamas, śakti etc., are all its synonyms. It is called avidyā when āvaraṇa power is predominant and māyā when vikṣepa power becomes dominant. Alternatively, it is māyā at the cosmic level and avidyā at the individual level. Avidyā rests on Brahman but acts on the jīvas. The jīvās are pratibimbas or reflections of Brahman in the antaḥkaraṇa (mind). The reflected images have no reality other than that of the original (bimba) brahman. This theory is called &#x2018;pratibimbavāda&#x2019; and contrasted with &#x2018;ābhāsavāda&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The &#x2018;Bhāmatīprasthāna&#x2019; of Vācaspati Miśra (A. D. 840) is the third and the last of these major schools. <em>Bhāmatī</em> is his celebrated commentary on the Śāṅkara-bhāṣya of <em>Brahmasūtras</em>. This school is built round the <em>Bhāmatī</em> along with its subsidiary commentaries <em>Kalpataru</em> of Amalānanda (13th cent A. D.). and <em>Parimalā</em> of Appayya Dīkṣita (16th cent A. D.) The views of this school can be briefly summarised as follows: Brahman is the material cause of the world, not as the locus of avidyā but as the object of avidyās supported by the jīvas. Māyā is only an accessory cause. Avidyā cannot abide in Brahman. It abides in the jīvas and is plural since the jīvas are plural. Vācaspati advocates two varieties of avidyā: the mūlāvidyā or kāraṇāvidyā (primal nescience); the tūlāvidyā or kāryāvidyā (derivative nescience). It is the latter that is responsible for bhrama-saṁskāras or error impressions. Also, Vācaspati appears more inclined towards the &#x2018;avacchedavāda&#x2019; or the theory of limitation with regard to the appearance of the jīvas. Just as a pot limits the infinite sky in itself, avidyā of the individual limits Brahman and makes it appear like a jīva. Another point of importance in this school is that the mahāvākyas do not produce anubhava (immediate cognition). It is the mind seasoned by meditation that gives such experience.</p>
			<p>Mention may also be made here of &#x2018;dṛṣṭisṛṣṭi-vāda&#x2019; which advocates that the world is created simultaneously with its perceptions, and, &#x2018;ekajīvavāda,&#x2019; which propounds that there is only one jīva which is in bondage and when it gets liberation, everything else disappears. Prakāśānanda (15th-16th cent. A. D.) is the chief exponent of these schools.</p>
			<p>Advaita was subjected to continuous criticism by other Vedāntic schools as also the Buddhists and hence the growth of polemical literature became inevitable. Mention must be made of two most important works of this type: The <em>Khaṇḍana-khaṇḍa-khādya</em> of Śrīharṣa (12th cent. A.D.) and the <em>Advaitasiddhi</em> of Madhusūdana Sarasvatī (16th cent. A. D.).</p>
			<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
			<p>It should be said to the credit of Advaita Vedānta that even now it is attracting the respectful attention from scholars of the highest calibre, both Eastern and Western.</p>

			<word>Advayatāraka Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>It is a minor Upaniṣad belonging to the <em>Śukla Yajurveda</em> and classed among the &#x2018;Yoga-Upaniṣads,&#x2019; Upaniṣads that deal with yogic meditations and other processes. Except for the last part which is in verses (14 to 18), the whole Upaniṣad is in elegant prose.</p>
			<p>It has been called &#x2018;Advayatāraka&#x2019; since it deals with Brahman, the one without a second (&#x2018;advaya&#x2019;), which takes us beyond (&#x2018;tāraka&#x2019;) saṁsāra or transmigratory existence.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad begins with the statement that it has to be taught to one who is struggling to meditate upon Brahman, the Absolute, (&#x2018;yati,&#x2019; &#x2018;one who struggles&#x2019;) who has practised self-control (&#x2018;jitendriya&#x2019;) and who has cultivated the six virtues like peace (&#x2018;śamādiṣaṭka&#x2019;). Then it describes that one who meditates upon light in between the eyebrows as Brahman attains to It. After negating the difference between the jīvātman (individual self) and Īśvara (Supreme Soul) as brought about by the limiting adjuncts like māyā, it goes on to describe a yogic meditation for attaining Brahman, the Absolute.</p>
			<p>The suṣumnā-nāḍī (a tube-like structure meant for the passage of the kuṇḍalinī) (See <ref>KUṆḌALINĪ</ref>.) is situated in the middle of the body, stretching from the mulādhāra plexus at the root of the spinal column, up to the brahmarandhra or the aperture in the crown of the head. It shines like the sun or the moon. The Kuṇḍalinī which is fine like the thread in the lotus stalk, is inside this suṣumnā and is shining like millions of lightnings. By closing the ears and meditating on the sound within and the blue light within, between the eyes, and witnessing it, one gets infinite happiness. This is meditation on the &#x2018;inside.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad then proceeds to describe the process of meditation on two points, &#x2018;outside&#x2019; and &#x2018;in between&#x2019; the &#x2018;inside&#x2019; and the &#x2018;outside.&#x2019; The first consists in fixing the gaze and the mind at any point in front of the nose, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 aṅgulas (an aṅgula is roughly about an inch) in distance, seeing it as of blue-yellow colour. The latter consists of meditating on the &#x2018;ākāśa&#x2019; or ether/space, near the tip of the nose but beyond it, and as being bright like the full sun of the morning or fire with leaping tongues. In both cases this light becomes a symbol for Brahman.</p>
			<p>Then comes the description of &#x2018;tārakayoga,&#x2019; meditation on the light in the head, by reversing the mental light into the area between the eye brows, inside the head but towards the crown. Such meditation can give the supernatural &#x2018;aṣṭasiddhis&#x2019; or &#x2018;eight powers.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Last comes the Śāmbhavīmudrā. It is the same as meditation already described, but, with the eyes without being closed or opened.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad ends with a description of the qualifications of the guru fit to teach such yoga.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;welcome&#x2019; [songs])</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Śrī Durgāpūjā is one of the major festivals of the Hindus celebrated on a grand scale in Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and Assam. Beautiful clay images are ceremonially installed during the period of nine days (1st to 9th in the month of Āśvina, śuklapakṣa or bright half) (October) and elaborate worship performed. &#x2018;Āgamanī&#x2019; is the name given to a particular type of songs generally sung on this occasion as part of the &#x2018;Kālīkīrtan&#x2019; programmes.</p>
			<p>Śrī Durgā is actually Pārvatī or Umā, the beloved daughter of queen Menā and king Girirāja (the king of Himālayas), given in marriage to Lord Śiva. It is long since the daughter has visited the house of her parents. The parents, especially the mother Menā, are anxious about her welfare since rumours have reached their ears that their daughter is languishing in her husband&#x2019;s house owing to his poverty and queer ways of life. The Āgamanī songs depict their concern and anxiety for their daughter and anger towards their son-in-law. They are full of tenderness of the mother&#x2019;s love for the daughter. Solicitude for the welfare of Umā, disgust with Śiva&#x2019;s way of life—especially his living in the cremation grounds, besmearing his body with ashes and begging his food—consequent anger expressing itself in a resolve not to send her back to her husband&#x2019;s house and even a grim determination to fight a wordy duel with him if he presses for her return—these are some of the sentiments frequently found in these songs. Rāmprasād, Kamalākānta and Dāśarathi are some of the well-known mystic poets who have composed these songs.</p>

			<word>āgamas</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;sacred books which teach the Truth from all aspects&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Āgamas are a certain class of Hindu religious literature which practically form the basis of Hindu religious practices of the post-Vedic era. Literally, the word means &#x2018;that which teaches Truth from all aspects,&#x2019; <em>ā samantāt gamayati</em>, and hence can denote the Vedas, or for that matter, any sacred book. But in practice it is used in a more restricted sense to indicate the above-mentioned class of literature.</p>
			<p>Though the āgamas are definitely post-Vedic since they deal elaborately with the deities Śiva, Śakti and Viṣṇu, their temples and rituals, it is rather difficult to fix their chronological origin and development. It can be definitely stated that some of the āgamas devoted to the cult of Viṣṇu were already in existence by the time of the <em>Mahābhārata.</em> The development of various āgamas might have continued till the 8th cent. A. D.</p>
			<p>A typical āgama is generally divided into four parts known as &#x2018;pādas.&#x2019; In the Vidyāpāda or Jñānapāda philosophical and metaphysical subjects are discussed. In the Yogapāda details of yogic practices required to purify the body and mind are given. In the Kriyāpāda, which is usually voluminous, temple architecture and iconography are dealt with. In the Caryāpāda, the details of spiritual sacraments as also the code of conduct expected of a novice are delineated.</p>
			<p>According to the deity propitiated, the āgamas are divided into three broad groups: Śaivāgamas, Śāktāgamas and Vaiṣṇavāgamas. The twenty eight Āgamas starting with <em>Kāmikāgama</em> and ending with <em>Vātulāgama</em> comprise the Śaivā- gamas. According to them, Śiva the Supreme God is &#x2018;pati&#x2019; (the Lord), the jīvas or individual souls are &#x2018;paśu&#x2019; (animal in bondage) and the three kinds of malas or impurities (āṇavamala, kārmikamala and māyāmala) comprise the &#x2018;pāśa&#x2019; (rope) by which the jīvas are bound. It is by the grace of Śiva, the Paśupati, that the paśus are able to get rid of their pāśas and get mokṣa or liberation.</p>
			<p>The Śāktāgamas, also known as tantras, are legion in number. They follow the Śaivāgamas very closely, the only exception being that Śakti or Devī (Power or consort of Śiva) gets the supreme place. The tāntric discipline has become divided into dakṣiṇācāra (the right-hand path), also known as &#x2018;samaya,&#x2019; and vāmācāra (the left-hand path), also called &#x2018;kaula.&#x2019; The former conforms to the decent and accepted norms of spiritual practice whereas the latter seems to advocate the theory that even aberrations can be sublimated to the level of the spiritual practice resulting in the experience of the same supreme Truth.</p>
			<p>The Vaiṣṇavāgamas, also called Saṁhitās, are divided into the <em>Vaikhānasa</em> and the <em>Pāñcarātra</em> schools. Both teach that Viṣṇu is the highest Truth and stress the importance of worship in temples.</p>
			<p>Jainism also has its āgamas written in the Ardhamāgadhi language, and is divided into two: Śrutāṅgas and Upāṅgas.</p>

			<p>Belief in karma and punarjanma (reincarnation) is one of the fundamental dogmas of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Karma or action, good or bad, must have its effect. Āgāmī-karma is the karma that is being done now or that will be done in future (before death) which will produce its results later.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;One who stunted the growth of the mountain Vindhya&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Agastya is one of the most famous ṛṣis (sages or seers) frequently met with in Hindu religious lore. He is the seer of several Ṛgvedic mantras (<em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 1.166 to 191). He is a brahmarṣi, the son of Pulastya and Havirbhuk. Sage Agniveśya is his disciple.</p>

			<p>According to another version he was the son of Mitra and Varuṇa, and was born in a kumbha or jar. Hence the names Kumbhaja, Kumbhodbhava, Kalaśīsuta and so on. Vasiṣṭha was his brother. He married Lopāmudrā (also known as Kāverī), the princess of Vidarbha and begot a son Dṛḍhāsya, also known as Idhmavāha. A man of vast knowledge and severe austerity he is said to have destroyed the demons Ilvala and Vātāpi, stunted the growth of the Vindhya mountain which was growing recklessly, obstructing the light of the sun, drunk the waters of the ocean to expose the demons Kālakeyas who were killed by the gods, to have been honoured by Rāma when he was living in the Daṇḍakāraṇya and to whom he gave divine weapons and also taught the <em>Ādityahṛdaya</em>-hymn later and brought about reconciliation between Indra and the Maruts.</p>
			<p>Though Agastya is not enumerated among the Saptarṣis (the seven great sages), he is included among the progenitors of &#x2018;gotra&#x2019; geneology. He has been accorded a stellar status and identified with Canopus, the brightest star in the sky of southern India.</p>
			<p>In the annals of Tamil religious lore and literature, Agastya is the accredited originator of the Tamil language, the author of the maiden grammar of that language and the first president of the first organization of Tamil litterateurs. He is also credited with the authorship of several works on medicine, mysticism and magic. One work called <em>Agastya Saṁhitā</em> which deals with ritualistic worship is available. It is part of Pāñcarātra literature. He is said to have visited several South East Asian countries like Borneo, Siam and Cambodia.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Agastya&#x2019; might have been a title. Several Agastyas may have been involved in these stories, syncretised into one.</p>
			<p>An Agastyāśrama, a hermitage of Agastya, has been mentioned in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>. This has been sometimes identified with Agastyapurī, east of Nasik in Maharashtra state.</p>
			<p>The <em>Vanaparva</em> of <em>Mahābhārata</em> (88.13) mentions an Agastyatīrtha in the Pāṇḍya country as an important place of pilgrimage.</p>
			<p>Seeing the star Agastya or Canopus when the sun is in the middle of Kanyā or Virgo and worshipping him at night is mentioned as a vrata (religious rite).</p>

			<p>Every religion has its rituals. We have plenty of them in Hinduism. Sandhyā or sandhyākarma or sandhyāvandana is a fundamental Vedic ritual obligatory on all the dvijas (the &#x2018;twice born,&#x2019; viz., the brāhmaṇas, the kṣattriyas and the vaiśyas). It is essentially an upāsanā (meditation, spiritual practice) and has several steps designed to elevate the mind to levels of meditation and mysticism. Aghamarṣaṇa is one such step in the process. It consists of taking a few drops of water in the right hand shaped like the gokarṇa (the ear of a cow), holding it near the nose and breathing out from the nose on the water (with the idea of driving away sin from oneself) to the accompaniment of the three Ṛgvedic verses beginning with &#x2018;ṛtaṁ ca&#x2019; (<em>vide</em> <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 10.190. 1-3), and throwing away the water to one&#x2019;s left on the ground. Though the subject matter of these mantras is creation and the Creator, the mantras themselves are reputed to be &#x2018;aghamarṣana&#x2019; or sin-effacing. These mantras can also be repeated during bath and as an expiation of sins.</p>
			<p>The mantras beginning with &#x2018;hiraṇya-śṛṅgaṁ varuṇaṁ prapadye&#x2019; and ending with &#x2018;ākrāntsamudraḥ&#x2019; which form part of the <em>Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> (55-70) are known as <em>Aghamarṣaṇasūkta</em>. The three ṛks of the aghamarṣaṇa ritual (&#x2018;ṛtaṁ ca&#x2019;) are also included in this. This <em>Aghamarṣaṇasūkta</em> is normally recited while taking bath in ponds or rivers. It is accredited with the power of destroying all sins, whether ordinary ones like the one incurred by eating the food given by evil ones or heinous ones like committing adultery and murder of the embryo.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>It is natural for human beings to commit sins, either knowingly or unknowingly. Very often they realise their mistakes and even repent for them. As knowers of human psychology, the ṛṣis (sages) of yore have prescribed certain religio-spiritual rituals that help in the eradication of sins.</p>
			<p>The <em>Aghamarṣaṇasūkta</em> is one such Vedic hymn (of prayer) prescribed for this purpose.</p>
			<p>It forms an integral part of the <em>Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> (Anuvāka 1, mantras 55-70).</p>
			<p>Water is a great purifying agent and should therefore be considered as an aspect of the Divine. Varuṇa is the presiding deity of water.</p>
			<p>This sūkta has to be chanted before taking bath in a river or lake or tank.</p>
			<p>The gist of the whole sūkta can be stated as follows:</p>
			<p>I take refuge in Varuṇa. Pardon me for having accepted gifts from unworthy persons.</p>
			<p>May Indra, Varuṇa, Bṛhaspati and Savitā destroy the sins committed by me. My salutations to them.</p>
			<p>Through the power of this mantra, let all the impurities in this water (where I am to bathe now) be destroyed. May Varuṇa purify me.</p>
			<p>I invite the seven sacred rivers—Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, Godāvarī, Narmadā, Sindhū and Kaverī—to be present here in this water.</p>
			<p>May Varuṇa, capable of effacing all sins, purify all the beings dwelling on the earth, in the atmospheric region and in heaven. Similarly may the Vasus also purify us.</p>
			<p>I am the Supreme Light which projected itself as the universe. I am the same light that shines as the inmost essence of all that exists.</p>
			<p>Varuṇa, the regent of waters and effacer of sins, absolves the sinners of all types.</p>
			<p>Though I am the ground of sins and am made to weep, wise men can favour me by destroying my sins.</p>
			<p>The Supreme Lord is infinite like the limitless ocean. He dwells in the hearts of devotees. He delights the individual souls by guiding them and offering the fruits of their action.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>No man, however careful, can avoid sins of omission and commission in life. Recognizing this fact, the Hindu dharma-śāstras have provided for prāyaścittas (expiations) by performing which, these sins can be obviated, or at least, their effects can be minimised. Aghamarṣaṇa-vrata is such a prāyaścitta prescribed by even the most ancient dharmaśāstra works like those of Gautama, Baudhāyana, Manu and Yājñavalkya, as an omnibus penance for all types of sins.</p>
			<p>The person performing it must fast for three days, recite the <em>Aghamarṣaṇa-sūkta</em> three times every day at the time of bath, standing in the water of a river or tank or pond, spend the days standing and nights, sitting. At the end of the vrata he should gift a milch-cow. This penance is said to be equal in sanctification to the avabhṛthasnāna (ceremonial bath) taken at the end of an Aśvamedha sacrifice.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Belief in the survival of the soul after death and the need to bring peace to the soul in a spirit body through appropriate obsequial rites are common to many religions. Hinduism goes to the extent of considering antyeṣṭi or death-rites to be performed immediately after the death of a person, a &#x2018;saṁskāra,&#x2019; a rite that purifies and uplifts the soul. As part of this ceremony, water libation (udaka) is offered for the benefit of the deceased during the period of ceremonial impurity (agha). There are differences of opinion among the dharmaśāstra writers with regard to the number and duration of these water libations.</p>
			<p>A near relative (called sapiṇḍa) of the deceased, should take water mixed with sesame in the añjali (joined palms) and offer it facing south, with appropriate mantras. It should be offered thrice a day for eleven days from the day of death.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Udakakriyā&#x2019; and &#x2018;udakadāna&#x2019; are the other names used for this rite.</p>

			<p>Śiva is a deity of the Hindu Trinity and is responsible for the laya or pralaya, dissolution, of the universe. One of the names, by which he is well-known, is Pañcānana or Pañcamukha, &#x2018;the five faced one&#x2019;. These five faces are actually five aspects of his manifestation. &#x2018;Aghora&#x2019; is one of these five. Facing south and ruling over the element agni (fire), Aghora stands for the power that absorbs and renovates the universe.</p>
			<p>Iconographically, he is shown with a terrific face and eight hands holding śūla (spear), ḍamaru (drum), pāśa (noose), kapāla (skull-cup), daṇḍa (staff), cāpa (bow), bāṇa (arrow) and asi (sword). The neck is blue and the rest of the body is black. The body is either naked or clad in the hides of elephant and lion. Snakes and scorpions form the ornaments.</p>
			<p>Since his terrible form frightens away all the sufferings of his devotees, who have taken refuge in him, he is &#x2018;Aghora,&#x2019; the &#x2018;not terrible&#x2019; to them.</p>
			<p>The mantra beginning with the words &#x2018;aghorebhyo&#x2019; in the <em>Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> (19.1) is known as &#x2018;aghora- mantra&#x2019; and is one of the five mantras well-known as &#x2018;pañcabrahma-mantras&#x2019; employed in the worship and meditation of Mahādeva Śiva visualised as having five faces.</p>
			<p>These mantras are normally prescribed for japa to a person who desires divine illumination.</p>

			<p>Aghorapanthis are the ascetics of a queer Śaiva order, who worship Śiva as &#x2018;aghora&#x2019; (&#x2018;the non-terrible&#x2019;). The origin of this sect which revels in abominable practices like cannibalism, eating from a human skull, besmearing with ashes from funeral pyres and a generous helping of spirituous liquors, is rather obscure. May be, they represent the remnants of some aboriginal non-Āryan religious cults which were absorbed into Hinduism in course of time. The few surviving members of the sect are to be found mostly in Bihar, Bengal, Rajasthan and Assam. Owing to the natural abhorrence of people towards such sects, their number has fast dwindled.</p>

			<p>Śaivism is a very ancient branch of Hindu religion. Rooted in the Vedas and āgamas, it has been developed into a formidable religio-philosophical system by a galaxy of mystics and writers. An important teacher often quoted especially by the Vīraśaiva writers is Aghora Śivācārya, a pontiff of the Āmardaka monastery at Cidambaram (Tamil Nadu) who probably lived in the 11th-12th cent. A. D. <em>Tattva-prakāśa</em> of king Bhoja of Dhārā is said to be a fundamental work on Śaivism. Aghora Śivācārya is reputed to have written a detailed commentary on this work, refuting the highly monistic interpretations of an earlier commentator Śrīkumāra. Another work usually attribu-ted to him is <em>Mṛgendrāgama-vṛtti-dipikā</em>, a commentary on the famous Śaivāgama, <em>Mṛgendrāgama</em>. He is credited with the authorship of several other works also like <em>Aghora-śivapaddhati, Tattvasaṅgraha, Mahotsavanidhi</em> and so on.</p>

			<p>Pārvaṇaśrāddha is an important rite performed during &#x2018;parvans&#x2019; i.e., amāvāsyās or new moon days with a view to propitiating the departed forefathers, up to the third generation. On such days, worthy brāhmaṇas are invited for dinner. A portion of the food prepared for the same is taken out in a vessel and seven āhutis or libations are cast into the homa fire with seven appropriate mantras. Two offerings each are made for the father, the grand-father and the great-grand- father and one for all the other pitṛs (forefathers) combined. This rite is known as agnaukaraṇa.</p>

			<p>Sins of omission and commission are inevitable in the life of a man however careful he may be. The law of karma being inexorable he is obliged to suffer their consequences. But none wants to suffer, and if given the chance to escape, will try for the same. With the full understanding of human nature and with a view to giving a chance for redemption to those who genuinely repent, the Hindu dharma-śāstras have devised elaborate prāyaścittas or expiations for sins. Kṛcchra—literally &#x2018;that which causes suffering&#x2019;—is a general word used for several penances out of which āgneya-kṛcchra is a variety. The main part of the discipline in this expiation is that the person performing it should subsist only on sesame (tila) for twelve days. Agni will be pleased by it and all the difficulties of the performer will be removed.</p>

			<p>Conquest of self gives mastery over the whole world. Conquest of the mind leads to the conquest of the self. Works on yoga portray the various age-old techniques for controlling the mind. Pañca-dhāraṇās, five kinds of fixing the mind on prescribed subtle principles, is one such method described in a well-known work on Haṭhayoga viz., <em>Gheraṇḍa Saṁhitā</em>.</p>
			<p>The fire principle is situated at the navel, in the form of a red effulgent triangle. Its presiding deity is Rudra. Fixing the prāṇa along with the mind on this fire principle at the navel for a period of five ghaṭis (i.e., 2 hours) is known as &#x2018;āgneyī-dhāraṇā.&#x2019; Destruction of the fear of death is the result achieved.</p>

		<description>
			<p>According to the Hindu scriptures, every elemental force is presided over by a deity. The presiding deity of tejas, fire and heat, is Agni.</p>
			<p>The religion of the Vedas being mainly centred round sacrificial rites, Agni the god of fire naturally gets the pride of place in the Vedic hymns. A large number of them are devoted to describing and praising him. He is often eulogised as the Supreme God, the creator, the sustainer and the all-pervading cosmic spirit. All the other gods are his different manifestations. He manifests himself as fire (agni) on this earth, as lightning and air (Indra and Vāyu) in the sky and as the sun (Sūrya) in the heavens. He acts as a mediator between men and gods by carrying the sacrificial offerings of men to gods. He is all-knowing and all-powerful. He is all-merciful too. Though an immortal he lives among the mortals, in every house. He protects them by dispelling their difficulties and fulfils their wishes. Without him, the world can never sustain itself.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>In the epics and the purāṇas he is said to have been born out of the face of the Virāṭ Puruṣa (Cosmic Being), married Svāhā, the daughter of Dakṣa, consumed the Khāṇḍava forest with the help of Arjuna whom he rewarded with gifts of divine weapons like the bow Gāṇḍīva, helped Indra to be relieved of a part of his sin of brahmahatyā (killing a brāhmaṇa) and restored Sītā to Rāma after she had entered the fire to prove her chastity.</p>
			<p>Iconographically, Agni is represented as an old man with a red body. He has two heads, a big belly and six eyes, seven arms in which he holds objects like the spoon, ladle, fan etc., seven tongues, four horns and three legs. He has braided hair, wears red garments as also the yajñopa-vīta (sacred thread). He is attended on either side by his two consorts, Svāhā and Svadhā. The smoke is his banner and the ram his mount. Obviously this is an anthropomorphic representation of the sacrificial fire.</p>
			<p>As sacrificial fire, Agni has five aspects known as Pañcāgni: gārhapatya, āhavanīya, dakṣiṇā (or anvāhāryapacana), sabhya and āvasathya.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the ancient Hindu reli-gious texts like the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (3.10, 11) Prajāpati (the Creator) gave the yajña (system of sacrifices) as the link between the human beings and the deities (devas) of the cosmic regions. Human beings were advised to propitiate these deities through various yajñas and the deities in turn would respond by bestowing upon them their needs.</p>
			<p>Vedic sacrifices which were simple fire rituals during the Saṁhitā period were gradually developed, by the period of the Brāhmaṇas, into a bewildering variety of rites and ceremonies with a labyrinth of details. One of the complicated sacrifices is the Somayāga of which agnicayana forms an integral part. However this rite is not compulsory even in Somayāga. Literally the word means &#x2018;piling the fire&#x2019; but in practice it refers to the rite of building up the altar on which the sacrificial fire (āhavanīya) will be lighted.</p>
			<p>The <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> (kāṇḍas 6 to 10) of the <em>Śukla Yajurveda</em>, which is the basic authority on this rite, represents it as a human imitation of the construction of the cosmic world of Prajāpati.</p>
			<p>Detailed instructions are given for the manufacture of the various kinds of bricks, of different shapes and sizes, and for the building up of the altar in several layers and of prescribed shapes. The most common shapes are those of suparṇa (eagle), śyena (hawk) and droṇa (trough). As many as 10,800 bricks are needed to complete the construction of the altar. A thorough knowledge of geometry is necessary on the part of the priests who guide and direct the construction. The bricks are usually laid in five layers, the 1st, the 3rd and the 5th being of the same pattern while the 2nd and 4th are different.</p>
			<p>Measuring the ground on which the altar is built, ploughing and sowing it with several seeds, interring the heads of five animals or their golden images and the golden image of the sacrificer as also a living tortoise into the altar that is being built are some of the details mentioned in the liturgical works.</p>
			<p>The piling of the altar could be completed in one year (8 months for the first four layers and 4 months for the last) or only in five consecutive days.</p>
			<p>The &#x2018;Agnicit,&#x2019; i.e., the person who performs agnicayana, is expected to observe certain vows during this period. He is permitted to do &#x2018;punaściti&#x2019; (doing agnicayana once again) if he does not prosper in the year after performing it.</p>
			<p>To obviate the effects of the sins of omission and commission during the agnicayana rite, several prāyaścittas (expiations) are prescribed.</p>
			<p>The esoteric doctrine of agnicayana is said to have originated with Prajāpati himself and come down through a succession of teachers from Tura Kāvaṣeya to Śāṇḍilya.</p>

			<p>No Vedic sacrifice can be conducted without the help and guidance of priests. Liturgical works on sacrifices enumerate four chief priests—hotṛ, adhvaryu, udgātṛ and brahmā—each of whom is assisted by a maximum of three more. Āgnīdhra, also called āgnīdh, is an important priest who is the assistant of brahmā but has much to do with the adhvaryu also. As the very name indicates, he is the person who lights the sacrificial fire and tends it. It is also his responsibility to ensure its proper distribution among the various vedis (altars). Apart from this, his chief function is to respond to the āśravaṇa-call of the adhvaryu with words such as &#x2018;astu śrauṣaṭ.&#x2019; He is also given the duty of seeing that everything is in order before invoking the deities. As an insignia of this authority, he holds the wooden sword called sphya.</p>

			<p>Yajña or sacrifice links the human beings with divine beings. When these divinities or devatās are propitiated through yajñas, they reward the performers with whatever they desire for (<em>vide Bhagavadgītā</em> 3.10-12).</p>
			<p>These yajñas may be nitya (obligatory, performed daily), naimittika (occasional) or kāmya (motivated). Again, depending upon the materials used they may be classified as pāka-yajña, havir- yajña and somayāga. If cooked food is offered in pākayajña and soma juice in somayāgas, milk and ghee are the materials normally used in haviryajña.</p>
			<p>Agnihotra is one of the most common and important sacrifices which is classed among the haviryajñas and considered to be nitya.</p>
			<p>It is performed more as a daily worship than for the fulfilment of any specific desire. It should be started from the very evening of the day on which agnyādhāna (establishing the Vedic fire ceremonially) is done. It is obligatory to perform it daily till death or old-age or saṁnyāsa. All the dvijas (the &#x2018;twice-born,&#x2019; the men of the first three varṇas) are entitled to its performance. It must be done twice daily at dawn and dusk, along with the wife. Wife, son or pupil can perform it on his behalf in emergencies.</p>
			<p>The main part of the rite consists in heating and offering cow&#x2019;s milk in a ladle into the gārhapatya fire with appropriate mantras. Sūrya (sun) and Prajāpati are the deities to whom offerings are made in morning and Agni and Prajāpati, in the evening.</p>
			<p>Instead of with milk, the rite may be performed with gruel, cooked rice, ghee or curds when specific fruits or results are desired for.</p>
			<p>The performer of Agnihotra is obliged to rear a cow. The milk vessel which must be an earthen pot with a straight brim is called &#x2018;agnihotra-sthālī&#x2019; and the ladle &#x2018;agnihotrahavaṇī.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>If and when the yajamāna (performer of the sacrifice) goes on a pilgrimage along with his wife, he can carry the gārhapatya fire with him or can ceremonially put it out and perform punarādhāna (re-establishing the fire) on his return.</p>
			<p>When he dies, the various wooden implements used by him for Agnihotra should be kept on various parts of his body as prescribed and the body cremated with the gārhapatya fire.</p>

			<p>Several steps are prescribed in the process of worship.

This is done with the recital of mantras like &#x2018;raṁ&#x2019; or &#x2018;sahasrāra huṁ phaṭ.&#x2019; This wall of fire is believed to act like a fort preventing evil spirits or passions from attacking the worshipper.</p>

			<p>Popular Hinduism is firmly based on the purāṇas. They have played an un- enviable part in preserving Hindu religion and culture, especially among the masses. The original stuff of the purāṇas is as old as the Vedas though the extant purāṇas are later productions showing unmistakable signs of compilation, evolution or even manipulation. Some scholars feel that the purāṇas contain much historical material also.</p>
			<p>Purāṇas are narratives of ancient events, &#x2018;purā bhavaṁ purāṇam&#x2019;. Though a purāṇa is said to have pañcalakṣaṇas (five characteristics) like the accounts of creation, dissolution, and geneology of kings, rarely do the purāṇas conform to this pattern. They are practically encyclopaedic in character dealing with every topic under the sun.</p>
			<p>Tradition ascribes the authorship of all the purāṇas to Vedavyāsa and divides them into two groups of Mahāpurāṇas (the great or the major ones) and the Upapurāṇas, (the small or the minor ones) each containing 18 works. <em>Agnipurāṇa</em> is usually classed as the eighth among the Mahāpurāṇas.</p>
			<p>Whether the extant <em>Agnipurāṇa</em>, now available in print, is the original or a purāṇa by name <em>Vahnipurāṇa</em> (vahni agni) whose manuscript has been discovered, is the original, has been a subject of scholarly disputation. Though scholars like Prof. R. C. Hazra are inclined to accord the latter, the status of the genuine or original purāṇa, it has gone into oblivion for the obvious reason that the former has met the needs of the people to a much greater extent.</p>
			<p>This <em>Agnipurāṇa</em> might have taken the present shape during the period A. D. 700-1100. It contains nearly 12,000 verses spread over 383 chapters. It is obviously a Vaiṣṇava work of an all comprehensive character containing almost everything of general interest.</p>
			<p>The following are some of the topics dealt with in this work: incarnations of God, creation, worship of Lord Viṣṇu and Agni, initiation, methods of building a temple, characteristics of śālagrāma stones and their worship, consecration of the deity in a newly built temple, greatness of places of pilgrimage and holy rivers like Gaṅgā, descriptions of the various worlds, amulets, mystic formulae, medicines, duties of men of the various āśramas (stages of life), expiations for sins, descriptions of hells, sandhyā ritual and Gāyatrī, consecration of a king and his duties, characteristics of precious stones, the science of archery, prosody, literature and greatness of this purāṇa.</p>

			<p>Works on Haṭhayoga like <em>Gheraṇḍa Saṁhitā</em> describe &#x2018;Ṣaṭkarmas&#x2019; or six purifi- catory techniques for cleansing the body. &#x2018;Dhauti&#x2019; the first of these is of four kinds: antardhauti, dantadhauti, hṛd-dhauti and mūlaśodhana. Antardhauti, the first of these is again of four varieties, viz., vātasāra, vārisāra, vāhnisāra or agnisāra, and bahiṣkṛta.</p>
			<p>Agni or vahni represents the &#x2018;fire&#x2019; of the digestive system (often called jāṭharāgni or vaiśvānarāgni), the capacity of digestion and assimilation. The health and strength of the body depends on the proper functioning of the digestive system. Agnisāra-dhauti is prescribed for the removal of functional disorders and even organic defects of this system.</p>
			<p>The process consists in &#x2018;pressing the navel knot a hundred times against the spinal cord&#x2019; by breathing out and contracting the abdominal muscles. This is said to result in the body acquiring a divine lustre and vital energy.</p>
			<p>As in all other Haṭhayogic exercises, this also should be practised under the direct guidance of a guru.</p>

			<p>Of all the Vedic sacrifices, Somayāga is, perhaps, one of the most complicated. A separate altar called mahāvedi is to be erected for the conduct of the Soma group of sacrifices. Since the yajamāna or sacrificer has already a vihāra (an old and permanent shed containing the three fires gārhapatya, āhavanīya and dakṣiṇāgni), the fire for the new sacrifices has to be carried from the vihāra to the mahāvedi. This is done as a part of the whole ritual.</p>
			<p>Taking out the agni (fire) from the old āhavanīya in the vihāra, as also the soma stalks from which soma juice is to be extracted for the Somayāga in a ceremonial procession is called &#x2018;agnīṣoma-praṇayana.&#x2019; This is done on the day before the sutyā (day of extraction of soma juice). The adhvaryu carries the fire on clay, the yajamāna and patnī along with their sons and grandsons following him, one behind the other, in a long procession. Soma stalks as also all the vessels needed in the sacrifice are brought in a cart and deposited in their respective places. The fire is deposited and kindled in his pit by the āgnīdhra priest.</p>

			<p>The system of sacrifices (yajñas and yāgas) forms the link between men and gods. Men propitiate gods through them and gods respond by bestowing upon men what they want. This is the doctrine propounded in the Hindu scriptures like the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (3.10-12).</p>
			<p>Somayāga is a general name for those sacrifices in which libations of the soma juice are offered in the duly consecrated fire. Agniṣṭoma is a typical Somayāga, forming the prakṛti or model for other Soma sacrifices. It is such an integral part of another well-known sacrifice, Jyoti-ṣṭoma, that these two are often identified. Literally the word &#x2018;Agniṣṭoma&#x2019; means &#x2018;praise of Agni&#x2019; and the rite derives its name from the hymns called stoma (a group of three ṛks) which are chanted in praise of Agni towards the end of the rite.</p>
			<p>On the first day, somapravākas or heralds of Soma sacrifice are sent out to invite priests. Choosing the priests, dīkṣā (initiatory rites) of the sacrificer including another small sacrifice called Dīkṣaṇīyā-iṣṭi and construction of bamboo sheds are the other rites to be performed.</p>
			<p>On the second day apart from purchasing the soma creepers and &#x2018;welcoming&#x2019; them ceremonially, two more rites called pravargya and upasad are performed. (For details see <ref>PRAVARGYA</ref> and <ref>UPASAD</ref>.)</p>
			<p>On the third day, pravargya and upasad rites are repeated followed by the construction of mahāvedi and uttaravedi (altars for performing the sacrifices).</p>
			<p>On the fourth day, after once again performing pravargya and upasad rites, fire is ceremonially transferred from the old and permanent sacrificial shed to the new. This is known as agnīṣoma-praṇayana. (See <ref>AGNĪṢOMA-PRAṆAYANA</ref> for details.) An animal sacrifice (paśu-bandha) is also performed.</p>
			<p>On the fifth and the last day called &#x2018;sutyā,&#x2019; the soma juice is extracted cere- monially three times and offered. The first called prātassavana is done in the morning. The second, mādhyandina-savana is done at noon. At the end of this, sacrificial fees are distributed. Soon after this, begins the third pressing called tṛtīyā. At the end of the sacrifice, all those directly involved in it have avabhṛtha-snāna (ceremonial bath marking the conclusion of the sacrifice).</p>

			<p>During the Vedic period, the perfor-mance of sacrifices was very common. It was believed that one could get whatever one desired through the appropriate sacrifices. Only men belonging to the first three castes, viz., the brāhmaṇas, the kṣattriyas and the vaiśyas, were eligible for establishing the Vedic fires and performing these sacrifices. Certain classes of śūdras like the rathakāras (carpenters) were also considered eligible. Even such persons had to establish the fires in a ceremonial way following the prescribed procedure. One who established the fires came to be known as an āhitāgni.</p>
			<p>Agnyādhāna, also known as agnyā-dheya (or simply ādhāna or ādheya) was this prescribed rite. Literally it means placing of burning coals for the generation of the gārhapatya fire.</p>
			<p>Only a married adult could establish the Vedic fires. He could do it on any day he felt the desire or had to do it only in certain seasons and on certain astronomically suitable days, nakṣatras or stars or asterisms being the determining factor.</p>
			<p>The actual rite was spread over two days though preparation of the araṇis (pieces of wood used in producing fire by attrition) and other implements would start much earlier.</p>
			<p>The first day known as upavasatha is devoted by the yajamāna (sacrificer) to preliminaries like choosing the priests (ṛtvigvaraṇa), offering them madhuparka (For details see <ref>MADHUPARKA</ref>.), preparing the sacrificial ground, having a shave and so on. Preparation and consumption of the brahmaudana (cooked rice meant for the priests) is another rite, performed by the adhvaryu. (See <ref>ADHVARYU</ref>.)</p>
			<p>After the first night and just before dawn the next day, fire is produced by the attrition of the two araṇis by the adhvaryu. Singing of sāmans at this time by the udgātṛ (priest of <em>Sāmaveda</em>) is a special feature. Gārhapatya fire in the hearth meant for it is the first to be set up. The āhavanīya fire is produced from the gārhapatya by the adhvaryu. The dakṣiṇāgni is set up by the priest āgnīdhra (one of the assistant priests) (See <ref>ĀGNĪDHRA</ref> for details.) either directly by the attrition of the araṇis or from the gārhapatya.</p>
			<p>Establishing of the other two fires, sabhya and āvasathya, is optional.</p>
			<p>After setting up the fires, various kinds of grains and fuel sticks are offered to them.</p>

			<p>Since the most ancient times brāhmaṇas—men of learning, austerity and character—have commanded the respect of the Hindu society. Kings used to vie with one another in granting land, cows and wealth to them for their personal use. Villages or lands (parts of villages) given to them for their maintenance have been known as &#x2018;agrahāra.&#x2019; People living in such agrahāras were called &#x2018;mahājanas.&#x2019; They were exempted by the kings from payment of taxes and also punishment for lapses in behaviour unless they were of a serious nature like treason, murder etc. The mahājanas themselves regulated the conduct of the inhabitants of the agrahāra.</p>
			<p>Agrahāras were intended to be centres of learning and the mahājanas were expected to be models of conduct.</p>

			<p>The month Mārgaśīrṣa, the 9th month of the Hindu calendar year (corres- ponding to November-December) is called Agrahāyaṇa (&#x2018;beginning of the year&#x2019;). According to the writings of the foreign travellers visiting this country like Al Beruni (A. D. 1030) and borne out by the internal evidence in the <em>Mahābhārata (Anuśāsanaparva</em> 106.17-30) the year began with Mārgaśīrṣa. Hence the name Agrahāyaṇa. The rite performed on the full-moon day of this month is called &#x2018;āgrahāyaṇī.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>An important part of this rite is pratyavarohaṇa (&#x2018;descending again&#x2019;) signifying the ceremonial descent of the entire family from a high cot or, couch which was being used from the month of Śrāvaṇa (corresponding to July-August) for fear of snakes. Hence this is sometimes considered a part of the snake rite.</p>
			<p>After uttering the prescribed mantras (which contain prayers to snakes not to harm the family) and offering pāyasam (milk-rice pudding) to them, the entire family comes down the high cot and sleeps on the bed of straw or grass newly prepared.</p>
			<p>On this occasion the house is usually replastered and painted, if not renovated.</p>
			<p>In some works pratyavarohaṇa is mentioned as a separate rite to be performed at the beginning of each of the six seasons.</p>

			<p>It was a custom among the ancient Hindus to offer newly harvested grains to the Vedic deities before consuming them. Āgrayaṇa is an agricultural rite of the iṣṭi type (See <ref>IṢṬI</ref> for details.) which an āhitāgni (one who has ceremonially established the Vedic fires) should perform, before making use of the newly harvested grains. The rite was considered necessary only with regard to vrīhi (rice), yava (barley) and śyāmāka (a kind of yellow grain, <em>Panicum frumentaceum</em>) and not for other grains, vegetables or fruits. Oblations of cooked food are offered to the deities like Indra and Agni. A lump of the cooked food should be thrown on the top of the dwelling house. The sacrificer should also eat a mouthful of the grain.</p>
			<p>Even those who have not established the Vedic fires can perform Āgrayaṇa in the aupāsanāgni (domestic fire lighted at the time of marriage) with an extra oblation to Agni-sviṣṭakṛt.</p>
			<p>This rite is also called Navayajña or Navasasyeṣṭi.</p>

			<p>Ahalyā, the wife of the sage Gautama and mother of another sage Śatānanda, is a well-known character in Hindu mythology. She is said to have been born out of creator Brahmā&#x2019;s mind as the very personification of feminine grace and beauty and given in marriage to the maharṣi Gautama. Infatuated by her beauty, Indra the king of gods impersonated Gautama and seduced her. Consequently she was cursed by the sage Gautama to remain invisible for a thousand years sustaining herself only on air and wallowing in ash. She was redeemed by Rāma, the son of Daśaratha and restored to Gautama.</p>
			<p>Some works like the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> say that she was converted into a stone. This version seems to be more popular.</p>
			<p>When Uttaṅka (or Udaṅka), a disciple of Gautama, offered to fulfil any of her desires as his gurudakṣiṇā (fees due to the preceptor) she asked for the kuṇḍalas (ear-ornaments) of queen Madayantī (wife of the king Saudāsa). Uttaṅka secured them successfully, though with great difficulty.</p>

			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Though born in a poor family of farmers, she was married to Khaṇḍe Rāo, the son of Mallhār Rāo Hoḷkar of Indore. When her husband died in a battle, she boldly took over the administration in A.D. 1765 and ruled with great efficiency till her demise in A. D. 1795. She was responsible for the protection of the original Śivaliṅgas of Somanātha and Kāśī temples by building separate temples for the same. She improved or renovated many temples in North India and also built rest-houses for pilgrims in the places of pilgrimage. The modern city of Indore owes its development mainly to her.</p>

			<p>Ahaṅkāra is that which produces abhimāna, the sense of &#x2018;I&#x2019; and &#x2018;mine.&#x2019; According to Sāṅkhyan metaphysics, a large part of which is accepted by Vedānta, ahaṅkāra is the principle of individuation that arises after mahat or buddhi in the process of evolution from prakṛti (nature). It is regarded as a substance since it is the material cause of other substances like the mind or the sense-organs. Through its action the different puruṣas (individual selves) become endowed each with a separate mental background. These puruṣas identify themselves with the acts of prakṛti through ahaṅkāra.</p>
			<p>At the individual level it makes the puruṣa feel that he is receiving the sensations through the senses and the mind, and deciding about appropriate action, through the intellect.</p>
			<p>At the cosmic level, the five senses of cognition (jñānendriyas), the five organs of action (karmendriyas), the mind (manas) and the five subtle elements like the earth (tanmātras) are produced out of ahaṅkāra.</p>
			<p>In some works of Vedānta, ahaṅkāra is considered as a function of antaḥkaraṇa (internal instrument or mind), responsible for ego-sense and possessiveness.</p>
			<p>Ahaṅkāra as egoism or self-conceit is considered as a great obstacle in spiritual life and the cultivation of humility is prescribed as its antidote.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu scriptural works declare that there is a close relationship between the body and the mind. In fact it is the mind, as the repository of karma, that creates the future body since it survives the death of the physical bodies till the attainment of mokṣa (liberation). Hence the body and the mind act and react on each other. In this context āhāra or food assumes great importance. The quality of food affects the quality of mind. In fact the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (7.26.2) goes to the extent of declaring that purity of food leads to purity of mind which results in the excellent retention in memory of all that is heard and studied from the preceptor. The resultant wisdom leads to freedom from all bonds. This is because the subtle part of the food that is eaten sustains the mind whereas the gross part of it nourishes the body.</p>
			<p>Āhāra is classified into three groups:</p>
			<p>sāttvika, rājasika and tāmasika (<em>vide Bhagavadgītā</em> 17.7-10). Sāttvika food contributes to longevity, health, strength and happiness. Rājasika food generates passion leading to sorrow and suffering. Tāmasika food produces dullness, indolence and drownsiness.</p>
			<p>The various scriptural works mention long lists of food articles coming under these three categories.</p>
			<p>There are regulations with regard to the quantity of food to be eaten and elaborate rules regarding the time, place and also company in which it should be taken.</p>
			<p>Moderation in eating is always the rule. Hindu medical works recommend that half the stomach should be filled with solid food and a quarter with water leaving the rest of the space for the movement of air.</p>
			<p>One is advised to avoid partaking of food before performing spiritual practices. Solar and lunar eclipses are believed to have very adverse effects on food and hence one should not eat during eclipses.</p>
			<p>Places to be avoided for eating include temples, public places, moving animals and vehicles.</p>
			<p>Impurity (doṣa) can accrue to food on three counts: jātidoṣa, nimittadoṣa and āśrayadoṣa. Garlic or cabbage for instance, is impure by its very species (jāti) and hence must be avoided. Nimittadoṣa comes by external impurities like dust or hair as also an insanitary handling of food. This can be obviated by strictly observing the rules of health and sanitation. Foods cooked, touched or handled by persons of questionable character become contaminated by their evil psychic vibrations which can be transmitted to those who consume them. This type of impurity is called āśrayadoṣa, doṣa or defect arising as a result of āśraya or repository. Offering the food to God before eating destroys this impurity.</p>

			<p>Derived from the root &#x2018;hve&#x2019; (&#x2018;to call&#x2019;) āhāva is the technical name of a formula of summons pronounced loudly by the hotṛ (chief of the priests representing the <em>Ṛgveda</em>) in a Soma sacrifice before starting the śastra (laudatory recitation). It is usually in the form of: śoṁ 3<aside>The numeral 3 indicates that the syllable is to be chanted for 3 units of time, called &#x2018;pluta,&#x2019; as against 1 unit of time (&#x2018;hrasva&#x2019;) or 2 units of time (&#x2018;dīrgha&#x2019;).</aside> sāvom or śoṁsāvo 3 (a corrupt form of śaṁsāva).</p>
			<p>Soma juice is extracted (savana) three times during the day: morning (prāta-ssavana), noon (mādhyandinasavana) and later in the day (tṛtīyasavana). During all these three savanas āhāva is done 4 times in the first, 5 times in the second and again 4 times in the third.</p>

			<p>Anyone who establishes the Vedic fires normally maintains three fires: gārhapatya, āhavanīya and dakṣiṇāgni. Most of the special sacrifices are performed in the āhavanīya which is kindled by the fire brought from the gārhapatya.</p>
			<p>The mound of āhavanīya is square and is situated on the eastern side of the sacrificial shed at a distance of twenty four padas or steps from the gārhapatya mound.</p>
			<p>The fire is established at dawn when half of the sun&#x2019;s disc has risen above the horizon. The adhvaryu lights a few fuel sticks on the gārhapatya fire and carries them in a vessel containing sand to the āhavanīya mound chanting the appropriate mantras. After establishing the fire it is propitiated with oblations of clarified butter and fuel sticks.</p>
			<p>In case the fire goes out, prescribed prāyaścittas or expiations should be under-gone. Reverencing it before death is believed to confer celestial worlds on the sacrificer.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;non-violence&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Ahimsā or non-violence has been a highly extolled virtue throughout Indian history. In fact, it is as old as the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself. To quote one mantra: <em>mā vo ghnataṁ mā śapatam prati voce deva yantam</em>, &#x2018;Return not blow for blow, nor curse for curse, neither meanness for base tricks. Shower blessings instead&#x2019; (<em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 4.1.8). Even during the Vedic period, when animal sacrifices existed and the animals were believed to attain heaven, the animal meant for immolation was made unconscious before being killed, so that it did not suffer. Prayers were offered and expiations done to ward off the effects of the sin of killing the animal which was inevitable in the sacrifices (<em>vide Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa</em> 3.7.9.8).</p>
			<p>Coming to the Upaniṣads, the earliest reference to ahiṁsā as an ethical discipline is found in the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (3.17.4; 8.15.1) where it has been bracketed with truth. The <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad </em>(5.2.3) emphasises the need for cultivating compassion, the corollary of ahiṁsā. The <em>Mahābhārata</em> often calls it the highest dharma (<em>ahiṁsā paramo dharmaḥ</em>—1.11.13-14). The purāṇas and dharma-śāstras extol it in glowing terms. It is even termed as &#x2018;sanātanadharma&#x2019; (the ancient religion) by some purāṇas like the <em>Brahmāṇda</em> and <em>Matsya</em>, and also des-cribed as the gateway to dharma. The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (2.30) lists it as the first virtue to be cultivated by the aspirant for yoga.</p>
			<p>Ahiṁsā is not injuring other living beings in thought, word and deed. This is the ideal to be relentlessly pursued by those who have dedicated their lives to the realization of the ātman (the Self). For them it is a mahāvrata (great vow). Others should practise it as far as possible.</p>
			<p>That physical injury or harsh words inflict pain and suffering is easily understood. However, what is not so easily understood is that inimical thoughts that one harbours against others harm both. This is a fact—whether one concedes it or not—as all minds, being parts of the one cosmic mind, are interconnected, so that a thought arising in one mind concerning another mind can always cause a reaction in the other, good for good and bad for bad.</p>
			<p>Ahiṁsā can never be practised perfectly without its complement, love. They are two sides of the same coin. Anyone who has practised it effectively radiates a wonderful atmosphere of peace. Even animals with mutual and natural enmity, if they come within the orbit of this influence, live in peace and harmony (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali 2.35).</p>
			<p>Some of the purāṇas (<em>vide—Brahmāṇḍa</em> 2. 36. 188) recommended the killing of tyrants and desperados and opined that such killing is no hiṁsā at all, since many will live in happiness and peace by their death.</p>
			<p>Buddhism and Jainism have accorded ahiṁsā the topmost place among virtues to be cultivated. Jainism has carried it to rather extreme lengths.</p>

			<word>Ahīna</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;lasting for several days&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Sacrifices are considered to be the links between men and gods like Indra. Ahīna is one of the several kinds which come under the Soma group of sacrifices. It is a general nomenclature for all Soma sacrifices wherein the extraction of the soma juice is spread over several days. Hence the name &#x2018;Ahīna,&#x2019; &#x2018;that which takes several days to perform&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>An Ahīna is always begun on a full-moon day. The extraction of soma juice may be spread over 2 to 12 days. It should always end with an Atirātra (another Soma sacrifice spread over a day and night). Along with the dīkṣā (consecration of the sacrificer at the beginning) and upasad (another small sacrifice of the iṣṭi type) the whole sacrifice should not extend beyond a month.</p>
			<p>The well-known Aśvamedha sacrifice belongs to the Ahīna group.</p>

			<word>Ahirbudhnya Saṁhitā</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Among the extant Vaiṣṇava Āgamas of the Pāñcarātra school, the <em>Ahirbudhnya Saṁhitā</em> is an important work. &#x2018;Ahir-budhnya&#x2019; is one who, in the form of an &#x2018;ahi&#x2019; or serpent, is the &#x2018;budhna&#x2019; or foundation of the world. So, literally it refers to Śeṣa or Ananta, the thousand-hooded serpent, on whose head the world is said to be supported, according to the accounts in some of the purāṇas. It is also mentioned as one of the names of Śiva who, according to the Vaiṣṇava scriptures, is a great devotee of Viṣṇu. In this work he is identified with Śiva. &#x2018;Saṁhitā&#x2019; is a general name given to any systematically arranged text.</p>
			<p>As in the case of many other Hindu religious works, it is rather difficult to assign any date for this work. Otto Schrader feels that it must have been composed later than A. D. 300 (See his <em>Introduction to the Pāñcarātra and the Ahirbudhnya Saṁhitā</em>, Madras: Adyar Library and Research Centre, 1973.)</p>
			<p>The Saṁhitā opens with a dialogue between two sages Bharadvāja and Durvāsas. Bharadvāja requests Durvāsas to propound the mystery of Sudarśana, the wondrous discus of Lord Viṣṇu. Durvāsas agrees to narrate faithfully the teachings given by Ahirbudhnya (Śiva) to Nārada on this subject, but only briefly. The original Saṁhitā before condensation is said to have had 240 chapters. However, the present printed text has 3880 verses in the anuṣṭubh metre, spread over 60 chapters.</p>
			<p>The teachings of this work can be briefly summed up as follows: Para-brahman, the Absolute, is the highest Truth. He is One, without beginning or end, all-pervading, free from all blemish, full and perfect. He resides in all beings and is called Nārāyaṇa. His real nature can be experienced only in the state of liberation, which again is possible only by His grace and not by one&#x2019;s own efforts.</p>
			<p>He has two śaktis or powers: kriyāśakti and bhūtiśakti. The Sudarśana cakra is actually the kriyāśakti representing the active side or the energetic aspect of the Lord (chs. 3 and 8 to 12). When it activates the bhūtiśakti which is the material cause of the world, creation of the world takes place (ch. 5-7).</p>
			<p>The created world which in the beginning is under the influence of sattva, goes on smoothly for some time. As sattva diminishes increasing the influence of rajas and tamas, people start going astray necessitating the proclamation of the original Śāstra (holy book) viz., the Pāñcarātra, by Saṅkarṣaṇa himself (an aspect of Lord Vāsudeva). The book describes the four aspects of manifestation of the Supreme Lord: para, vyūha, vibhava and arca. (See <ref>PĀÑCARĀTRA ĀGAMA</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>Then follow the descriptions of philosophical systems like Trayī, Sāṅkhya and Yoga ending with the Sātvata (Pāñca-rātra). It is interesting to note that Buddhism and Jainism are dismissed as śāstrābhāsa (fallacious systems) invented by gods and ṛṣis to spread confusion among the wicked!</p>
			<p>The <em>summum bonum</em> of life is &#x2018;atyanta hita&#x2019; (&#x2018;greatest well-being&#x2019;) which puts a permanent end to all suffering and gives eternal bliss. This can be gained by dharma (religion) and jñāna (knowledge), the former being the stepping stone for the latter. Both these are described in the Pāñcarātra system, by following which mokṣa (liberation) can be gained.</p>
			<p>Then there is a detailed description of mantras (sacred syllables), characteris-tics of the ācārya (preceptor), śiṣya (disciple) and dīkṣā (initiation). (<em>vide</em> chapters 18 to 20.)</p>
			<p>Rakṣās and yantras (magical diagrams), their worship and meditation as also the fruits accruing from them are described next (chs. 21 to 29). Practice of yoga is also dealt with in detail (chs. 30, 31). Astras or magical weapons are another topic described in detail.</p>
			<p>Human beings naturally desire cures from all physical and mental diseases. This subject also has been dealt with. The cures suggested are ritualistic or mystical. There is also a detailed description of the Mahābhiṣeka (&#x2018;great baptism&#x2019;) by the performance of which one can get rid of all diseases (ch. 39).</p>
			<p>There are a number of upākhyānas (stories) given to illustrate the effects of divine weapons and of certain amulets and talismans.</p>
			<p>The great Sudarśanamantra, the root of all mantras, which enables one to cause the Sudarśana Puruṣa to appear before oneself, is another subject dealt with (chs. 43, 44).</p>
			<p>Other mantras described in the work are: tārāmantra (i.e. Om), mantras of Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa, meaning of the word namaḥ, Narasiṁha-mantra, Gāyatrī, explanation of some sections of <em>Puruṣa-sūkta, Śrīsūkta</em> and others.</p>
			<p>Unlike the Vaikhānasa works, this work of the Pāñcarātra system does not deal with temples and rituals.</p>

			<p>One who has established the Vedic fires by performing the Agnyādhāna ceremony is called an āhitāgni. According to Jaimini&#x2019;s <em>Pūrva Mīmāṁsā Sūtras</em>, an āhitāgni has to maintain the fires and utensils throughout his life. On his death, he is cremated in his fire along with the sacrificial utensils which are placed on the different parts of his body. This is called pratipatti.

			<word>āhnika</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;that which is done in a day&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the dharmaśāstras, every dvija (&#x2018;the twice-born,&#x2019; i.e., the brāhmaṇa, the kṣattriya and the vaiśya) has to follow a strictly regulated daily routine. Every item of it, even those pertaining to the physical needs of the body, should be considered and performed as a religious duty. Such an attitude is conducive to his spiritual welfare.</p>
			<p>Such duties as are to be performed during the course of an &#x2018;ahan&#x2019; or day, are called &#x2018;āhnika.&#x2019; Day-time, for practical purposes, was extended for a short time before sunrise and after sunset. This period was usually divided into eight equal parts and different items of the daily routine were assigned to different periods of the day.</p>
			<p>Principal matters discussed under āhnika are: bodhana and utthāna (getting up from the bed), śauca (bodily purity), dantadhāvana (brushing the teeth), snāna (bath), sandhyā (prayers to be offered at dawn), japa (repetition of mantras), tarpaṇa (libations to forefathers), pañcamahāyajñas (five daily sacrifices), homa (attending to the sacrificial fire), devapūjā (worship of God), bhojana (taking food), arthasañcayana (earning wealth), svādhyāya and pravacana (studying and teaching the Vedas), evening sandhyā, dāna (giving gifts) and nidrā (going to sleep).</p>
			<p>Each one of these has been described in great detail in the smṛtis and digests often noting the alternatives or variations. The more important of these can be briefly described here.</p>
			<p>Contemplating on God and holy beings is the first duty to be done, on waking up. Answering calls of nature should be done in consonance with the rules of health and sanitation. Bath should be taken in cold water, preferably in a river or a pond, repeating the <em>Aghamarṣaṇa sūkta, </em>the <em>Puruṣa sūkta</em> and other prescribed Vedic hymns. A householder is expected to bathe twice a day, once before sunrise and again before noon. While bathing, tarpaṇa (offering water ceremonially to gods, sages and manes) should also be done. Along with wearing fresh washed clothes after bath, putting the tilaka or caste mark (ūrdhva-puṇḍra, tiryakpuṇḍra, candana and so on) is also recommended. Then come the sandhyā ritual and Gāyatrī japa. This is followed by homa, offering libations of milk in the consecrated fire. Study of Vedic texts, feeding guests and animals, devoting time to the earning of wealth for maintain-ing the family are other items of daily routine.</p>
			<p>For details, see under the respective title.</p>
			<p>The word āhnika has been used as the name of the various chapters or sections of the <em>Mahābhāṣya</em> (the great commentary) by Patañjali on the grammatical sūtras of Pāṇini.</p>

			<word>Ahobila Maṭha</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;the Ahobila Monastery&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Maṭhas (monasteries) and maṭhādhi-patis (pontiffs) have played a very signi-ficant role in spreading, consolidating and preserving Hindu religion and culture among the masses. A maṭha is more than just a monastery, though the residence of the monk or monks is an important and integral part of the same. A temple, an auditorium and a school for the pursuit of religious and philosophical studies exist invariably in any maṭha of repute.</p>
			<p>Among the more well-known of such maṭhas, the Ahobila Maṭha of the Śrī-vaiṣṇavas which follows the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of philosophy propagated by Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) and others has carved out an important place for itself.</p>
			<p>Ahobila is an important place of pilgrimage situated in the Vedācala hill range of the Eastern ghats. It is about 23 kilometers (15 miles) from Āḷḷagaḍḍa, in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. When Mahāviṣṇu manifested himself in the form of Narasiṁha (&#x2018;man-lion&#x2019;) and killed the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu with his bare hands, the gods are said to have exclaimed &#x2018;aho! balam!&#x2019; (&#x2018;Wonderful is the strength!&#x2019;). Since many stone icons of this Narasiṁha aspect are found in the several &#x2018;bilas&#x2019; or caves of this place, the place itself has been named &#x2018;Aho-bilam.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The founder-pontiff of the Ahobila Maṭha was Ādivaṇa-Śaṭhagopa-Yatīndra-Mahādeśikan, known as Śrīnivāsa in his premonastic days. Born in A. D. 1378 in Tirunārāyaṇapura (the present Melkote near the Mysore City of Karnataka) and brought up in a holy and scholarly atmosphere, Śrīnivāsa was commanded in a vision by Lord Narasiṁha to go to Ahobila and take saṁnyāsa (monastic order). Accordingly he went there and was initiated into saṁnyāsa by an old monk who appeared there mysteriously, enlightened him about the mission of his life and disappeared. Acting as the servant of Lord Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha whose image he used to carry, Śaṭhakopa established a chain of maṭhas wherein he arranged for the study of the works of Rāmānuja and Vedānta Deśika. He is said to have accorded some privileges to the lower classes in the temples he built at Kadiri (Andhra Pradesh) and elsewhere. He passed away in A. D. 1458.</p>
			<p>Among his successors, called Jīyars, mention may be made of the 6th, Parāṅ-kuśa (A.D. 1499-1513) who was reputed to have acquired extraordinary yogic powers, the 33rd, Śaṭhagopa (the VI) (A. D. 1853-1879) who converted robbers into devotees, the 38th, Śrīnivāsa (A. D. 1905-1909) who proved to be an excellent administrator, and the 40th, Raṅganātha (the IV) (A. D. 1915-1923) who was a rare combination of scholarship and yogic powers.</p>
			<p>Unlike the other maṭhas, the Ahobila Maṭha does not have a Headquarters. It moves along with the Jīyar, the pontiff. The deity worshipped is known as Mālola Lakṣmī-Nṛsiṁha, the image being of solid gold. Only the devotees of the Vaḍagalai (&#x2018;Northern&#x2019;) sect of Śrīvaiṣṇavas are disciples and followers of this Maṭha.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Āhuti is offering oblation to deities, into duly consecrated fire. It is an important part of Agnihotra and other Vedic (and also tāntric) rites. The usual procedure is to melt the butter in a pot over the gārhapatya fire, purify it by dipping two pieces of darbha-grass, fill the juhū (offering spoon or ladle) with the melted butter (called ājya) and offer it into the āhavanīya fire after first putting a samidh (sacrificial fuel) into it. &#x2018;Svāhā&#x2019; is the mantra normally uttered by the adhvaryu while giving the āhuti.</p>
			<p>Oblation of a larger quantity of ājya given at the end of a rite signifying its conclusion is called pūrṇāhuti.</p>

			<p>Situated on the right bank of the river Malaprabhā in the Bijapur district of Karnataka State, this little village has carved out for itself a very important place in the archaeological map of India. A large number of Hindu temples built of stone, but now in ruins, is located in and around this village. They belong to the period A. D. 500-650 and were built by the Cāḷukyas of Bādāmi (A. D. 500-757).</p>
			<p>There are reasons to believe that human settlements existed here even in the 7th century B. C. By A. D. 700, it had grown into a big city, famous not only for trade and commerce but also for the settlements of learned brāhmaṇas.</p>
			<p>The old temples, about 125 in number, have been divided into 22 groups depending upon their special features. Among these, the Durgā temple, the Lāḍkhān temple, the Huccimalliguḍi and the Meguṭi temple are more famous and have provided a lot of information regarding the history of the development of Hindu architecture. There is a temple dedicated to Brahmā too. Though all the temples are in ruins, only in the Rāmaliṅga temple, worship is continuing even today.</p>
			<p>The village has a fort and also three cave temples.</p>
			<p>A number of inscriptions belonging to different periods (A. D. 700-1200) have been recovered from the various sites of this village.</p>

			<p>In ancient India, the king was consi-dered as the representative of God, if not God himself, on earth. The coronation of a king was an elaborate ritual spread over several days. Aindrī-śānti was the rite performed on the 6th day to propitiate the god Indra. A detailed description of this rite has been given in a work called <em>Rājadharma Kaustubha</em> of Anantadeva (17th cent. A. D.).</p>
			<p>The officiating priest should subsist only on milk or vegetables or fruits on the twelve preceding nights. Worship of Gaṇeśa and the navagrahas (the nine planetary deities), chanting of a number of ṛks (mantras from the <em>Ṛgveda</em>) and homa are important items of the ritual.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>When the devas (gods) and asuras (demons) started churning the kṣīra-samudra (milk-ocean) with a view to getting amṛta (ambrosia), several divine and mysterious objects emerged, out of which the majestic Airāvata (also called Airāvaṇa) the four-tusked white elephant was one. Indra, the chief of the devas, chose it as his mount.</p>
			<p>According to another version, Airāvata was the offspring of the elephant Bhadramanasa which Indra claimed as his mount.</p>
			<p>Indra, who is also the presiding god over rain, sends down rain while sitting on this elephant. It is to this elephant that Indra threw the sacred garland given by the sage Durvāsas, out of arrogance and pride. The animal in turn threw it under its feet and trampled it thus enraging the irascible sage who cursed Indra to lose his sovereignty.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Airāvata is also the name of the elephant supporting the earth on its eastern quarter and is one of the eight elephants known as aṣṭadig-gajas, believed to be supporting the quarters.</p>
			<p>It is sometimes described as the king of elephants and a prototype of all the elephants (<em>vide Viṣṇupurāṇa</em> 1.22).</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Airāvata&#x2019; is also the name of a serpent king who is said to have protected Aśvasena, the son of Takṣaka (another serpent king).</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;son of Itarā&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Aitareya, also known as Mahidāsa Aitareya, is the ṛṣi (sage) credited with the authorship of the Brāhmaṇa, Āraṇyaka and Upaniṣad (of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>) that go in his name. The <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (3.16.7) mentions him as having lived for 116 years as a result of meditating upon his life as a yajña or sacrifice. This has become known as &#x2018;puruṣayajña.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>According to other accounts given in the purāṇas, he was the son of Itarā and Māṇḍuki (whence his name Aitareya). Since he never spoke, the mother Itarā, thinking that he was dumb, prayed to Mahī (mother Earth) who blessed him with divine knowledge and wisdom (whence the additional appellation Mahīdāsa or Mahidāsa).</p>
			<p>He was an ardent devotee of Lord Vāsudeva and had been repeating constantly the <em>dvādaśākṣarī mantra</em> (the twelve-lettered mantra, viz., &#x2018;Oṁ namo bhagavate Vāsudevāya&#x2019;). Once the Deity appeared to him in a vision and comman-ded him to take to the second stage of life, that of the householder, to please his parents. Accordingly he went to one Harimedhas who was performing a sacrifice, exhibited his divine powers and knowledge and secured the hand of his daughter in marriage as also enough wealth.</p>
			<p>The Vedic sections associated with his name are said to have been revealed to him in the yajñaśālā (sacrificial shed) of Harimedhas.</p>

			<word>Aitareya Āraṇyaka</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Each of the four Vedas, the basic scriptures of Hinduism, is again divided into four parts: Saṁhitā, Brāhmaṇa, Āraṇyaka and Upaniṣad.</p>
			<p>The <em>Aitareya Āraṇyaka</em> (2500 B. C.) is one of the two Āraṇyakas belonging to the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, the other being <em>Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka</em>. It has five main divisions each of which is also given the appellation &#x2018;āraṇyaka.&#x2019; For instance, the first division is called &#x2018;prathamāraṇyaka,&#x2019; the second &#x2018;dvitīyāraṇyaka&#x2019; and so on. The total number of adhyāyas or chapters is eighteen. These adhyāyas are again subdivided into khaṇḍas or small sections.</p>
			<p>The first āraṇyaka describes the &#x2018;mahāvrata&#x2019; which is a part of the Sattra-yāga known as &#x2018;Gavāmayana&#x2019; and performed on the penultimate day. (See <ref>SATTRAYĀGA</ref> and <ref>GAVĀMAYANA</ref> for details.) This rite derives its name primarily from the fact that a sāman (a hymn from the <em>Sāmaveda</em>) called &#x2018;mahāvrata&#x2019; is sung while offering a cup of soma juice to Prajāpati (&#x2018;Father of beings&#x2019;) who is also called &#x2018;mahān&#x2019; (&#x2018;the great one&#x2019;). A priest playing on a harp and another sitting on a swing, shooting of arrows, mimetic fights, dancing with water pitchers on the head by the servants—these are some of the important side-lights of the ritual.</p>
			<p>The first three adhyāyas of the second āraṇyaka deal with uktha or niṣkevalya śastra, and describe prāṇa, the vital force and the greatness of puruṣa (human being). Niṣkevalya śastra consists of certain Ṛgvedic stanzas which are to be chanted (and not sung) at the time of pressing the soma juice during sacrifices like Gavāmayana. Certain meditations connected with it are described.</p>
			<p>The rest of this āraṇyaka (i.e., the fourth, fifth and sixth adhyāyas) comprises the well-known <em>Aitareya Upaniṣad</em>. (For details see <ref>AITAREYA UPANIṢAD</ref>.)</p>
			<p>The third āraṇyaka deals with the special upāsanās or contemplations and their fruits connected with the saṁhitā-pāṭha, padapāṭha and kramapāṭha (the vedic texts and their systematic breaking up for convenience in remembering and interpreting). It also deals with the ariṣṭas (ill-omens) manifesting through certain physical signs like seeing the sun as moon, as not seeing one&#x2019;s head through the mirror or through dreams, as seeing a man of black complexion—all of which forebode death. Names of certain ancient ṛṣis like Śākalya, Māṇḍūkeya, Pāñcālacaṇḍa and Tārkṣya are mentioned as the propagators of the upāsanas.</p>
			<p>The fourth āraṇyaka which is very short deals with the mahānāmnī mantras of <em>Sāmaveda</em> which are to be chanted on the fifth day of the mahāvrata.</p>
			<p>The fifth āraṇyaka which is the last, deals with many ritualistic details of the mahāvrata.</p>
			<p>Hindu tradition ascribes only the first three Āraṇyakas to Aitareya, the fourth and the fifth being attributed to Āśvalāyana and his guru Śaunaka.</p>

			<word>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Brāhmaṇa is the second important section of the Vedas, the first being the Saṁhitā. Whereas the Saṁhitā is in poetry and deals with a variety of subjects, the Brāhmaṇa, which is in prose, confines itself to liturgy, describing the <em>modus operandi</em> of the various sacrifices.</p>
			<p>The <em>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</em> (3000-2500 B. C.) is the longer one of the two extant Brāhmaṇas of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>—the other being <em> Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa</em>—and is attributed to Mahidāsa Aitareya (See <ref>AITAREYA</ref> for details.). There is reason to believe that this is, perhaps, an abridged edition of an earlier and much bigger work. The book is divided into eight pañcikās (quintets) each consisting of five adhyāyas or chapters which are again subdivided into kaṇḍikās or short sections. In all, there are 285 kaṇḍikās spread over 40 adhyāyas. The language is almost as archaic as that of the Saṁhitā and certain word-groups tend to appear repeatedly.</p>
			<p>Since this work contains many details of sacrificial rites which are rather bewildering to the modern mind, only a very brief summary of the contents will be attempted here. The first thirteen adhyāyas give a minute description of the various duties and responsibilities of the hotṛ (principal priest of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>) (See <ref>HOTṚ</ref> for details.) in the sacrifice called Agniṣṭoma. Agniṣṭoma being a prakṛti or prototype of all other Somayāgas (which are its vikṛtis or modifications or versions) it has been given the pride of place here. Adhyāyas 15-17 describe the sacrifices Ukthya, Atirātra and Ṣoḍaśī which are all vikṛtis of Agniṣṭoma. The 18th adhyāya deals with the Sattrayāgas (which take a full year to perform) and the part the hotṛ is expected to play in it. The next six adhyāyas (19 to 24) concern themselves with the sacrifice called Dvādaśāha, the emphasis again being on the instructions to the hotṛs. Agnihotra is described in the 25th. The duties of the hotṛ and his assistants in the Somayāgas which take several weeks are described in the five adhyāyas 26 to 30. The last two pañcikās comprising adhyāyas 31 to 40, contain interesting material from which plenty of information can be gathered on contempo-rary history. Rājasūya sacrifice is the main theme of the adhyāyas 31-35. It is here that we come across the well-known story of Śunaśśepha and Hariścandra. The last section (adhyayās 36 to 40) deals with the coronation of Indra and gives a long list of the various kings who were coronated by ṛṣis following the same pattern of Indra&#x2019;s coronation. The work ends with the exhortation to the king to appoint a purohita (priest) and the qualifications the latter has to possess to deserve the honour.</p>
			<p>Some of the special features of this Brāhmaṇa may now be noted: It appears that the deity Viṣṇu was highly respected by the Vedic society of that time. A number of earlier religious works are quoted from which we can surmise the existence of other Brāhmaṇa works which are not available now. It is interesting to note that the work criticises the views of other works and earlier teachers, if and when found necessary.</p>
			<p>Out of the several ṛks (Ṛgvedic mantras) quoted here, a few have not been found in the extant <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em>. Perhaps another śākhā or branch of the <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> different from the Śākala recension available now, must have existed.</p>
			<p>The whole text is overwhelmingly weighed in favour of the sacrificial system of religion leaving practically no room for metaphysical ideas as, for instance, in the Upaniṣads.</p>
			<p>By the time of this Brāhmaṇa, Āryan culture had already spread to Eastern India, though Central India continued to be the heart of it. Kings of the Kuru-Pāñcāla race were ruling in Central India. Kings of the east were called &#x2018;sāmrāṭ&#x2019; and of the south &#x2018;bhoja.&#x2019; Emperors who conquered these used to assume titles like &#x2018;ekarāṭ,&#x2019; &#x2018;sārvabhauma&#x2019; or &#x2018;parameṣṭhin.&#x2019; They believed that the rite &#x2018;mahābhiṣeka&#x2019; (by which Indra was coronated) would induce in the king the necessary power and inspiration to achieve this sovereignty.</p>
			<p>Emperors and kings were fond of performing long and complicated sacrifices, especially the &#x2018;mahābhiṣeka.&#x2019; Curds, honey, ghee and water were being used in this rite for anointing and sprinkling. Though the State exercised full control over the people, the brāhmaṇas were deemed to have transcended it.</p>
			<p>The book contains a list of twelve kings who underwent this mahābhiṣeka rite. Janamejaya, the great-grandson of Arjuna as also Bharata, the son of Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā are included in this list.</p>
			<p>Though the people were ardently devoted to the sacrificial rites they had not neglected the life here and now. Brāhmaṇas vied with one another to exhibit their erudition while the kṣattriyas did the same in the field of physical prowess and skill in arms.</p>

			<word>Aitareya Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Upaniṣads which usually form the last part of the Vedas and hence known as Vedānta (anta = end) contain the quintessence of Hindu philosophy. They deal with certain fundamental questions of metaphysics: the Creator, process of creation, nature of the created world, true and apparent nature of the individual, relationship between this individual and the Creator, goal of life and the path that helps achieving it.</p>
			<p>Out of the ten or twelve Upaniṣads considered more ancient and important the <em>Aitareya Upaniṣad</em> is also one. It forms part of the <em>Aitareya Āraṇyaka</em> (adhyāyas 4 to 6 of the 2nd Āraṇyaka) of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. Mahidāsa Aitareya who is mentioned in the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (3.16.7) is the ṛṣi to whom this Upaniṣad was revealed.</p>
			<p>The previous parts of the Āraṇyaka contain instructions regarding karma (Vedic rituals) and prāṇopāsanā (meditation on prāṇa, the vital breath or energy). Anyone who has performed these two seriously and sincerely will become fit for ātmajñāna (self-knowledge). This has been expounded in the next three (4 to 6) adhyāyas which comprise this Upaniṣad.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad starts with a description of creation. In the beginning the Ātman alone existed. He reflected: &#x2018;Let me create the worlds.&#x2019; Then he created four worlds: ambholoka (supercelestial region of waters), marīciloka (the heavens with their celestial lights), maraloka (the mortal earth) and āpoloka (the subterranean region of waters). Desiring to create the protectors for these worlds, he proceeded to create first, Virāṭpuruṣa (&#x2018;World-Person&#x2019;)—an intermediate entity subsisting between the Ātman and the universe—whom he fashioned out of the waters. From him proceeded the organs of senses, then their corresponding functions and lastly the deities or cosmic powers corresponding to such functions in the cosmos.</p>
			<p>The Ātman who can now be called Īśvara, made the Virāṭpuruṣa subject to hunger and thirst. Consequently the deities born out of him also became subject to the same limitation. On the request from the deities for a suitable locus from which they can act, he created the human body into which they gladly entered. Hunger and thirst which were left behind were also provided a place, but as an integral part of these deities.</p>
			<p>On further reflection, realizing the need for &#x2018;food&#x2019; by the Virāṭpuruṣa along with the deities, Īśvara created food articles like corn and animals. The Virāṭ-puruṣa was able to grasp this food only with the apānavāyu (the prāṇic energy responsible for digestion and excretion) and not with the other deities (or indriyas, i.e., faculties).</p>
			<p>Since the body of the Virāṭpuruṣa could not live without the presence of the Ātman or Īśvara, he entered into it through the brahmarandhra (the aperture in the crown of the head).</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad then describes how the jīvātman (the ātman bound in the body) transmigrates, conception, birth and rebirth being his three kinds of births. It also quotes the great sage Vāmadeva who realised his true nature as the ātman, free from the shackles of bodies and senses, even while he was in the womb of his mother.</p>
			<p>The last section describes Ātman or Brahman as &#x2018;prajñāna&#x2019; (consciousness) because of whose presence only all experience is possible. One of the four famous <em>mahāvākyas</em> (great dicta) of the Upaniṣadic literature viz., <em>prajñānaṁ brahma</em> (&#x2018;Prajñāna is Brahman&#x2019;) comes in this section (3.1.3).</p>
			<p>Out of the several theories of creation given in the Upaniṣads, the one given here appears to be more enigmatic if not altogether inscrutable. However, a little reflection is enough to convince that it falls in line with the general philosophy of the Upaniṣads. The various accounts of creation given in the Upaniṣads normally fall into three categories: through trivṛtkaraṇa (triplication) as in the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em>; through pañcīkaraṇa (quin-tuplication) as in the <em>Taittirīya Upaniṣad</em>; and through the Virāṭpuruṣa (cosmic person) as here.</p>
			<p>The purpose of creation is to give the unredeemed jīvas (individual souls) one more chance for redemption. This means that each of the jīvas must have a suitable body and a sphere of activity. The latter is provided by the various lokas or worlds, states of being, and the Virāṭpuruṣa forms the matrix as it were from which the former is shaped. Apart from the physical body, the sense-organs and the mind, located in it, form the basis of all activity. Hence their creation has also been des-cribed. The deities like Agni and Āditya mentioned here are the lokapālas, &#x2018;protectors of the worlds&#x2019;. They are the entities endowed with the power of maintaining order in the created worlds. At the cosmic level, each of them represents the totality or essence of that particular power manifested in creation. At the individual level, it is the controlling power of the particular faculty. For instance, Agni at the cosmic level represents the fire-principle, whereas the same at the level of the individual body represents the power of speech which illumines the dark areas of unknown fields of knowledge.</p>
			<p>The &#x2018;hunger and thirst&#x2019; of the deities is a sign of their incompleteness and hence indicates that they too have fallen into the ocean of saṁsāra (transmigratory existence). This is but natural since the whole of the created world, starting with the Virāṭpuruṣa himself, is within the realm of saṁsāra. Their &#x2018;food&#x2019; is the corresponding object of sense, united with which, the deities feel satisfied.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The word is derived from &#x2018;iti + ha&#x2019; (&#x2018;it seems, it was so&#x2019;). It refers to legends and because of their didactic value, they are cherished and preserved as a part of ancient tradition. The paurāṇikas (bards) consider it as a source of knowledge valid like pratyakṣa (direct perception), anu-māna (inference) and āgama (scriptural testimony).</p>
			<p>The incidents related in the aitihyas usually have a historical basis. In course of time, fact and fiction get fused into an integrated whole. At this distance of time, it is often impossible to distinguish fact from fiction. However, Hindu tradition has always accorded it a very high place.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Etymologically the word means that which is unborn or uncreated. Hence it is applied to all the three deities of the Hindu Trinity viz., Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. It is also applied to the ātman or the self since according to the Hindu scriptures, it is uncreated.</p>
			<p>In the Vedic liturgical works, the word denotes the he-goat, considered sacred to Pūṣan (an aspect of Sun) and associated with the sacrificial horse in the Aśvamedha (horse-sacrifice) which is believed to lead the horse to the next world. The skin of a sacrificed goat was used in the Vedic funerary rites for laying the dead body.</p>
			<p>In astronomy &#x2018;aja&#x2019; indicates the sign Aries.</p>
			<p>The <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em> (4.5) compares prakṛti or nature to ajā (she-goat) of three hues (red, white and black, an obvious reference to the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas) and the jīvātman to aja (he-goat) and depicts him as the enjoyer of prakṛti.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Aja is a well-known king of the Ikṣvāku race. He was the son of Raghu, father of Daśaratha and grandfather of Rāma. He was christened &#x2018;Aja&#x2019; (= the unborn, i. e., Brahmā) since he was born at brāhmīmuhūrta (the hour preceding sunrise considered as related to Brahmā, the Creator). Indumati, the Vidarbha princess was his queen. She was a celestial maiden born as a human being as a result of a curse. She was delivered from the curse by the sage Nārada. Her untimely death left Aja inconsolable. Kālidāsa devotes three sections (sargas 5, 6 and 7) of his famous poetical treatise <em>Raghu-vaṁśa</em> to the story of Aja and Indumati.</p>
			<p>The <em>Ṛgveda</em> (7.18.19) has used the word to indicate the people of the country of Aja who honoured Indra after his victorious war against Bheda, the enemy of Sudāsa.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Literally the word ajaḍa stands for any active and sentient principle as opposed to jaḍa, the inactive and the insentient. However it is used as a technical term in the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of philosophy, the chief exponent of which was Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137). Dravya or substance can be divided into two groups: jaḍa and ajaḍa. Prakṛti or nature and kāla, or time are grouped under jaḍa. Īśvara (God), Jīva (individual soul), nityavibhūti (immaterial infinite domain of Īśvara) and dharmabhūtajñāna (attributive consciousness of the jīvas) are classed under ajaḍa.</p>

			<word>Ajāmila</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Every saint has a past and every sinner a future. Tears of repentance wash off the sins. Lord&#x2019;s name purifies even the vilest of sinners. A typical example of transformation is Ajāmila whose legend inspires the devotees of God even today.</p>
			<p><em>Bhāgavata</em>, the classic scripture of devotion and spiritual wisdom, recounts the ancient tale of Ajāmila (6.1 and 2) and glorifies devotion to Viṣṇu.</p>
			<p>Born and brought up as a pious brāhmaṇa, he once fell a victim to the infatuations of a slave girl and married her after deserting his legally wedded wife and children born of that wedlock. To maintain her and the brood of her children, he took to sinful ways of life like cheating and robbery. When he lay in his deathbed he saw the fierce-looking messengers of Yama (the king of death), got frightened and started calling his last son, Nārāyaṇa by name. The very utterance of this name, being the name of Lord Viṣṇu, brought His servants also on the scene. Then as Viṣṇu&#x2019;s servants intervened on behalf of Ajāmila (since what he had uttered was the divine name, the very utterance of which destroys all sins) there ensued a dialogue between them and the messengers of Yama. Hearing this dialogue wherein the glory of the divine name was extolled, Ajāmila broke down with repentance. Strangely enough he recovered, but repaired to the bank of the sacred river Gaṅgā, practised severe austerities, engaged himself in the repetition of the divine name and attained liberation after death.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Celebrated for its cave-paintings, Ajantā is actually a range of hills in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra State. It was originally known as Ājīntha.</p>
			<p>The caves are situated at a distance of 6.5 kms. (4 miles) from the village Fardapur, which itself is 101 kms. (63 miles) from Aurangabad, the district head-quarters.</p>
			<p>They are excavated in the semicircular scarp of a steep rock, about 76 metres (250 ft.) high overlooking a narrow sinuous gorge, through which flows a stream called Waghora, descending at the head of a ravine as a waterfall.</p>
			<p>There are 30 caves in all including the unfinished ones. They must have been carved out during the period, 2nd century B. C. to the 7th century A. D.</p>
			<p>Some of them contain inscriptions which are also dated.</p>
			<p>The caves were probably excavated for the use of the Buddhist (Hīnayāna) monks for their retreat in the rainy season.</p>
			<p>Some of them are caityas (See <ref>CAITYA</ref>.) whereas the others are vihāras (monasteries).</p>
			<p>A remarkable feature of these caves is the paintings on their frescoes. They depict the various episodes of Buddha&#x2019;s life as also a few aspects of the contempo-rary social life. The 16th, 17th and the 19th caves contain some remarkable paintings.</p>
			<p>The caves contain charming sculptural decorations also.</p>

			<word>ajapā-japa</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;silent repetition&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Japa (repetition of the name of God) is considered to be one of the easiest and most efficacious means of attaining spiritual illumination. Lord Kṛṣṇa goes to the extent of identifying himself with it and calls it a yajña or sacrifice (<em>Bhagavadgītā</em> 10.25). When japa is practised constantly and continuously, practically with every breath, it gets merged as it were with the process of breathing itself. Such an unconscious and automatic japa is christened &#x2018;ajapā-japa.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Though theoretically, any mantra pertaining to any deity can be chosen for this purpose, in practice this is always confined to the &#x2018;haṁsamantra.&#x2019; &#x2018;Haṁsaḥ&#x2019; is the abbreviation of &#x2018;ahaṁ saḥ&#x2019; (&#x2018;I am He&#x2019;) or its more well-known form &#x201c;so&#x2019;ham&#x201d; (&#x2018;He, I am&#x2019;). With every inhalation the syllable &#x2018;haṁ&#x2019; is repeated and with every exhalation the syllable saḥ. Deliberate and conscious practice of this will gradually result in automatic and unconscious repetition coeval with breathing. It is only then that it becomes &#x2018;ajapājapa.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>&#x201c;Haṁ-saḥ&#x201d; or &#x201c;so&#x2019;ham&#x201d; is actually the same as the mahāvākyas (the great dicta of the Upaniṣads—See <ref>MAHĀVĀKYAS</ref> for details.) <em>aham brahma asmi</em> (&#x2018;I am Brahman&#x2019;) or <em>tat tvam asi</em> (&#x2018;You are That&#x2019;). In these statements &#x2018;aham&#x2019; or &#x2018;tvam&#x2019; represents the jīva or the individual soul; &#x2018;brahma&#x2019; or &#x2018;tat&#x2019; stand for the Supreme Soul or the Absolute. Since the two are apparently poles apart, they can never be identical. However, when only their essential characteristic, viz., caitanya or pure consciousness is considered, they can be considered identical or as the same.</p>
			<p>According to the Tantras, &#x2018;ham&#x2019; repre-sents the Śiva principle and &#x2018;saḥ&#x2019; represents the Śakti principle. So &#x2018;haṁsaḥ&#x2019; stands for their union and the entire universe created from that union.</p>
			<p>Literally haṁsa means a swan. Swan is the vehicle of Brahmā the creator. Haṁ and saḥ represent the inspired and expired breath. Everything movable and immovable &#x201c;breathes&#x201d; or vibrates and hence can be denoted by &#x2018;haṁsa.&#x2019; Therefore it is meet that Brahmā the creative aspect of the Supreme Self is represented as seated thereon.</p>
			<p>The <em>Haṁsopaniṣad</em> (15) describes the cosmic form of God using the haṁsa imagery to facilitate meditation. The same Upaniṣad also relates the experiences that arise as a result of the ajapājapa of haṁsa-mantra (16).</p>
			<p>Repetition of the haṁsa-mantra or ajapājapa is also known as <em>Ajapāhaṁsa-vidyā</em>.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A term often met with in Sanskrit works, it means &#x2018;one whose enemy is not born.&#x2019; It can refer to anyone who is so great and mighty that cannot be challenged by any as an enemy. More often it signifies a man who is so good, compassionate and noble that none hates him. Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍavas possessed such qualities and hence is known by that name.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> mentions one Ajātaśatru, the king of Kāśī (2.1) who was a great jñāni and who taught the ṛṣi Dṛpta Bālāki. The story is repeated in the <em>Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa Upaniṣad</em> (4.1) also.</p>
			<p>According to the Buddhist lore, Ajātaśatru, the son of king Bimbisāra, and a ruler of Magadha committed several heinous crimes, repented of them and approached the Buddha for solace. It was on this occasion that the Buddha taught the well-known <em>Sāmāññaphala Sutta</em>.</p>
			<p>The fortress of Pāṭalīputra, the capital of Magadha, was built by him.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;doctrine of non-origination&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Creation of the world is one of the fundamental problems invariably discussed in the Indian philosophical systems. In whichever way a system posits the basic reality—as one or many—from which the world has evolved, logical and ontological difficulties can never be avoided. Gauḍapāda (7th cent. A. D.) the guru of Śaṅkara&#x2019;s preceptor, and the famous author of the <em>Kārikās</em> (concise commentary in verses) on the <em>Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad</em> has successfully tackled this problem by denying the problem itself!</p>
			<p>Considered as the earliest writer on Advaita Vedānta, Gauḍapāda takes the extreme view that Brahman or Ātman alone is the only reality that exists and hence neither the world nor the jīva (individual self) ever comes into being. Since Brahman has no birth (jāti = birth or origination) nor modification, his doctrine is termed <em>ajātivāda (Kārikās</em> 4.71).</p>
			<p>Brahman alone is real. Anyone who sees the world of duality as existing and tries to discover its origination from Brahman is trying to &#x2018;see the footprints of the birds in the sky&#x2019; (ibid 4.28)!</p>
			<p>Gauḍapāda establishes his <em>ajātivāda</em> basing his arguments on the śrutis (revealed scriptures viz., the Upaniṣads) as well as logic and reasoning. He admits that the Upaniṣads have described creation but avers that they have never declared it to be real (3.15). The main purport of such statements is to emphasize the non-dual Reality behind this apparent diversity.</p>
			<p>After successfully countering the arguments of all other schools and establishing his <em>ajātivāda</em>, Gauḍapāda goes to the extent of denying even ajāti! Since the very concept of an external world which includes the so-called revealed scriptures, is an illusion, even the theory of ajāti established on the basis of such scriptures and logic, is an illusion! From the highest standpoint, the Ātman is not aja (unborn) also. He is beyond all relative descriptions and hence defies all such attempts (4.74).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Ajina is skin in general and the skin of a black antelope in particular. Hence the name kṛṣṇājina. Throughout the ages it has been a symbol of holiness and Vedic culture. Even the country Āryāvarta, has been defined as the territory where kṛṣṇamṛga or the black antelope wanders freely. The <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> (1.1.4. 1-2) compares yajña (sacrifice) to a black antelope with white, black and yellow hair representing respectively the Ṛk, Sāman and Yajus.</p>
			<p>Being considered holy, it is often used in sacrificial rites for various purposes as in husking grains from which cakes are made.</p>
			<p>It is used by the brahmacārin (celibate novice pursuing the Vedic studies) and the yati or muni (ascetic) as a seat or spread or a couch.</p>
			<p>A strip of kṛṣṇājina used to be worn by the dvijas in the earlier days as yajñopavīta (sacred thread) which was later replaced by the thread.</p>

			<p>Jaina metaphysics divides dravya or substance into two broad groups: astikāya (that which has a body and hence extended in space) and anastikāya (that which has no body). The astikāyas are again sub-divided into jīva (animate) and ajīva (inanimate). Ajīva is further subdivided into dharma (the medium necessary for motion), adharma (medium necessary for rest or immobility), ākāśa (space) and pudgala (matter).</p>

		<description>
			<p>India has been a land of ascetics and asceticism since millennia. The ājīvakas (sometimes misspelt as ājīvikas also) a group of such ascetics mentioned in the edicts of Aśoka pillars seem to be an ancient order of some standing.</p>
			<p>According to their tradition Nanda-vatsa, Kṛśa-Sāṅkṛtyāyana and Maṅkhalī-putta or Maskarin Gośāla are the three great teachers from whom the sect originated and got stabilised. Historians believe that Gośāla was a younger contemporary of Mahāvīra, the last of Jaina Tīrthaṅkaras. Jaina texts like the <em>Uvāsagadasāo</em> graphically describe the conflict between them triggered off by the desertion of Saddāla-putta of the Ājīvaka sect who went over to the Nirgrantha sect of Māhāvīra.</p>
			<p>Not much is known of the doctrines of this sect. They practised severe auste-rities and were probably followers of Haṭhayoga and occultism. That they might have lived in caves is suggested by the inscriptions of Aśoka mentioning the dedications of cave-dwellings for their use in the Barabar hills of Bihar. They might have practised nudity.</p>
			<p>Ghurye feels that the sect had a house-holder section also (G. S. Ghurye, <em>Indian Sādhus</em>, Bombay, Popular Prakashan, 1953, p. 36).</p>
			<p>Except for some references in Buddhist works like the <em>Dīgha Nikāya</em>, there is practically no literature left about their philosophy. They were probably fatalists, agnostics or even atheists.</p>
			<p>Whatever might have been their philosophy, they once commanded respect and influence in the society and were rivals of the Jaina ascetics.</p>
			<p>Practice of unsocial customs, perhaps cost them their popularity.</p>

			<word>ajñāna</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;non-knowledge&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The concept of ajñāna is most funda-mental to Advaita Vedānta. In fact, it can be rightly called the cornerstone upon which the mighty edifice of Advaita metaphysics stands.</p>
			<p>Ajñāna is not so much &#x2018;ignorance&#x2019; or &#x2018;nescience&#x2019; as &#x2018;non-knowledge.&#x2019; It successfully prevents knowledge from arising. Once knowledge does arise, ajñāna just disappears! Rooted in jñāna or consciousness as its locus, it unfolds its charms and spells.</p>
			<p>An oft-quoted illustration given in the works on Advaita Vedānta to explain ajñāna is that of the rope appearing as snake (in insufficient light) and nacre appearing as silver (in moonlight). It is ajñāna that is responsible for this appearance. Since the snake and silver are actually perceived—unlike the son of a barren woman or the horns of a hare—they are not asat (unreal). Since they disappear on the rise of the knowledge of their substratum viz., the rope and the nacre, they are not sat (real) either. Hence ajñāna, responsible for this phenomenon is described as sad-asad-vilakṣaṇa, (different from both the real and the unreal), just as the neuter gender is different from both the masculine and the feminine genders.</p>
			<p>This ajñāna is said to be bhāvarūpa (existent) since it is experienced as indicated in such statements as &#x2018;I do not know anything&#x2019; or &#x2018;I am ignorant;&#x2019; or since it does not cause the rope and the nacre disappear completely from view. It is endowed with two śaktis or powers viz., āvaraṇaśakti (veiling power) and vikṣepaśakti (transforming power). It veils the true nature of rope and nacre and shows up snake and silver in their place by apparently transforming them.</p>
			<p>Ajñāna at the cosmic level is termed māyā and is often identified with prakṛti (nature) with its three guṇas sattva, rajas and tamas. At the individual level it is more commonly called &#x2018;avidyā&#x2019; and is held responsible for the apparent limitation of the ātman (the Self) as jīva (embodied being subject to transmigration).</p>
			<p>In conclusion it can be said that in Advaita Vedānta, jñāna refers to caitanya or pure consciousness which is one and infinite. Hence a-jñāna is that phenomenon which makes this infinite appear as many and finite.</p>

			<p>Offering oblations (homa) into a duly consecrated fire is an important part of Vedic rituals. Melted butter, generally used in such oblations is called ājya. When no specific material is prescribed for a homa, ājya can be used. Though cow&#x2019;s ghee is preferred as the best, (she-) buffalo&#x2019;s ghee or sesame oil may also be used for the purpose.</p>
			<p>Ājyabhāga is the name given to the two libations of ājya offered to Soma and Agni preceding the principal oblation in the Darśa sacrifice.</p>

			<p>Utsavas or religious festivals are the heart of popular religion. Among the many festivals of Hinduism, Durgotsava is consi-dered very important and is very popular too, especially in Bengal, Bihar and Assam. It is a festival dedicated to the worship of Durgā, the Śakti or Mother-goddess, and is usually done to a consecrated clay image. After the festival is over, the image is taken out in a procession and is immersed in the waters of the sea, a river, a lake or even a big tank.</p>
			<p>According to the Hindu mythological literature, the gods of the Hindu pantheon go to sleep during the month of Āṣāḍha (June-July) and wake up during the month of Kārttīka (October-November). Since the Durgotsava is celebrated during the month of Āśvina or Āśvayuja (September-October), from the 6th to the 10th days of the bright half, the goddess Durgā will still be asleep. She has to be woken up for the worship. This ceremonial awakening of the deity is known as &#x2018;akāla-bodhana&#x2019; or &#x2018;bodhana&#x2019; since the waking up (bodhana) is being done at an odd time (akāla = untimely, odd time).</p>
			<p>According to the Bengali tradition of this worship, Rāma is said to have awakened and worshipped Durgā before the final encounter with Rāvaṇa, the demon king of Laṅkā, on the 9th day of Āśvina bright half and achieved victory by her grace on the 10th, now known as &#x2018;Vijayadaśamī.&#x2019; He had to do this since his need was very urgent. This legend appears in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> of Kṛttivāsa (15th century A. D.) in Bengali. Thus the tradition of worshipping Durgā during Āśvina is said to have been started by Rāma himself.</p>

			<p>A kṣattriya king of the Kṛtayuga (the golden age, the first of the four ages or aeons of the world) known as Akampana lost his dear son Hari in a battle and was stricken with inconsolable grief. The divine sage Nārada took pity on him and consoled him with love and logic, describing the inevitable end of all life (<em>Mahābhārata, Droṇaparva</em> 52 and <em>Śāntiparva</em> 2.62).</p>
			<p>Akampana is also the name of a rākṣasa (demon) mentioned in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> (<em>Araṇyakāṇḍa</em> 31, <em>Yuddha-kāṇḍa</em> 56). He was the son of Sumāli and was the first to inform Rāvaṇa of the massacre of Khara and his assistants by Rāma. He was later killed in the battle by Hanumān.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Ākāśa, the sky, with its firmament dotted with stars, planets and other celestial objects has often provided the poets with inspiration to sing. The philo-sophers however have looked at it from an entirely different angle. Is it empty space, a hollow vacuum? Or, is it a material substance, however fine and subtle it may be?</p>
			<p>As in the case of other subjects of philosophical enquiry, here also various viewpoints have emerged.</p>
			<p>In Jaina metaphysics, ākāśa is consi-dered as space, eternally existing. Its function is to afford room for the existence of all astikāyas or extended substances. Jīvas (souls), pudgala (matter), dharma and adharma (substances responsible for mobility and immobility)—all exist in ākāśa. It is too subtle to be perceived by the senses. Its existence has to be inferred. It is of two kinds—lokākāśa (space contain-ing the world of souls and matter) and alokākāśa (empty space beyond such world).</p>
			<p>In the Vaiśeṣika system ākāśa is considered as a dravya or substance, one of its nine kinds. It is the all-pervading substratum of the quality of sound.</p>
			<p>The Sāṅkhya, the Yoga and the Vedānta systems consider ākāśa as one of the five tanmātras (potential elements or generic substances) pertaining to sound. The ākāśa that is experienced by us (it is one of the pañcamahābhūtas or five elements) is formed by these tanmatras by the process of pañcīkaraṇa or quintupli-cation. (See <ref>PAÑCĪKARAṆA</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>According to the process of creation as described in the Upaniṣads, ākāśa is the first of the five bhūtas or elements that emerge out of the Ātman (<em>Taittirīya Upaniṣad</em> 2.1).</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣads have sometimes used the word ākāśa for Brahman also (<em>vide Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> 1.9.1).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Throughout the history of mankind it has been seen that people have often cherished the ambition to possess and to exercise extraordinary or (even) supernatural powers. Mystical sciences like yoga have dealt with this subject either directly or as a byproduct of some other discipline.</p>
			<p>One such power that has fascinated man is the ability to fly through space. The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali refers to this power in 3.42.</p>
			<p>Ākāśa or space (or ether) is both outside and inside our body. There is a certain relationship between them. If one can concentrate on this relationship, starting the process with dhāraṇā (fixing the mind on the object of concentration) and dhyāna (meditation) and ending it with samādhi (superconscious experience) (the three together are technically called saṁyama) the exact nature of the relation-ship will be realised and the technique of levitation can be mastered. This will then give a clue to the means of cutting the bonds that bind the body down (preventing it from free movement) to the ordinary law of gravity.</p>
			<p>Ākāśagamana can also be mastered by practising saṁyama on light objects like cotton. This will give the secret of that lightness which can then be superimposed on one&#x2019;s own body.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Places of worship have existed from very ancient times. A Hindu temple, though a place of worship, is much more than that. It is a replica of the universe, an image of God, an image of man with God in his heart—all rolled into one.</p>
			<p>The most essential part of a temple is the garbhagṛha or <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>. It is here that the image or the symbol of the deity is installed.</p>
			<p>In front of this garbhagṛha, separated from it, will be a big hall (at least in the big temples) known as maṇṭapa or nṛtta-maṇṭapa or navaraṅga. It is used for congregational religious purposes like singing, dancing, recitation of religious texts or religious discourses.</p>
			<p>This maṇṭapa can have walls or it can be just a shelter without walls, the roof being supported on pillars. In the latter case it is termed ākāśamaṇḍapa.</p>

			<p>Ākāśīdhāraṇā is one of five such dhāraṇās technically called &#x2018;pañcadhāra-ṇās&#x2019; in the works on Haṭhayoga. Such dhāraṇās help in the conquest of the mind. This again can—when properly guided—lead to the realization of the Self. Incidentally, certain supernormal powers are also attained in the process.</p>
			<p>Ākāśīdhāraṇā is dhāraṇā or fixing the mind on the principle of ākāśa or ether. The colour of ākāśa is like that of ocean water. Sadāśiva is its presiding deity. Its bīja (seed-letter) is &#x2018;ha.&#x2019; Fixing the mind along with the prāṇa on it for five ghaṭikās (one ghaṭikā = 24 minutes) will help the yogi to gain liberation. Neither death nor pralaya (dissolution of the world) can affect him.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Advaita Vedānta advocates nidi-dhyāsana or meditation on the nature of the ātman as the means for its realization. This should be preceded by śravaṇa (hearing about the ātman from the guru or preceptor) and manana (reflection leading to a clear concept and conviction). Once the nature of the ātman is comprehended, and a clear idea formed in the mind, maturing into a deep conviction, meditation can be proceeded with.</p>
			<p>In meditation, the mind takes the form of the object presented to it. Such modifications are called vṛttis and are like waves unto water. When each succeeding wave is similar to the preceding wave, meditation results.</p>
			<p>The object of such meditation in Advaita Vedānta is the Ātman itself, which again is identical in its essence with Brah-man, the Absolute. Brahman is akhaṇḍa, partless, since it is a homogeneous reality, nay, the only Reality that exists. So, when the mind starts meditating on Brahman which is akhaṇḍa, its vṛttis take on the form of akhaṇḍa-Brahman. Such vṛttis are called akhaṇḍākāra-vṛttis. When this meditation ripens into samādhi (absolute concentration), the vṛttis die down and akhaṇḍa-Brahman stands revealed.</p>

			<p>Ākhyānas are narratives recited from memory but having their basis in some historical incidents. Some commentators define ākhyāna as the description of incidents witnessed by the narrator and distinguish it from upākhyānas which are also such descriptions but not directly witnessed by the narrator. It is these ākhyānas—which are mostly stories of kings or holy men—that have formed the basis of itihāsas (epics) and purāṇas (mythology). Ākhyānas are often found in Vedic literature, as stories narrated to kings during sacrifices.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>From the beginning two main currents of religious thought have existed in the Hindu scriptures: that of jñāna (knowledge) and that of bhakti (devotion).</p>
			<p>The schools of devotion advocate that bhakti is the direct means to mokṣa (liberation) and even go to the extent of stressing that it is much easier than jñāna.</p>
			<p>A devotee of God can cultivate bhakti for several reasons: to get over his troubles, to get wealth, position or pleasures of life or to realize God. It is the last category that is bhakti in the real sense, the others being just trading in religion. A true devotee of God, called ekāntin, wants Him and Him alone and nothing else. Such a devotion is designated &#x2018;akiñcana-bhakti,&#x2019; a devotion that does not want anything else from Him.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In Indian history, if the middle ages (A. D. 900-1600) were a &#x2018;dark period&#x2019; in the political sense, they also proved to be the &#x2018;golden era&#x2019; from the standpoint of religious revival. Most of the Bhakti Movements belong to this period. As against the movements in the North, which were predominantly Vaiṣṇavite in character, the movements in the South were both Śaivite and Vaiṣṇavite, the former being the more widespread. The movement of the Śivaśaraṇas of Karnataka with its philosophy and religion of Vīraśaivism, became—and still is—a force to reckon with. The stress on bhakti (devotion) as an easy mode of sādhanā (spiritual practice) available to everyone and the loosening of the caste restrictions among the bhaktas (devotees of God) thereby giving the masses a chance to mix on equal terms with the classes, were the special features of this movement.</p>
			<p>Among the sixty well-known mystics of the Vīraśaiva movement most of whom were men, Akka Mahādevī (also known as Mahadeviyakka) has occupied an impor-tant place. Born probably in A. D. 1130 at Uḍutaḍi (a village in the Shivamogga District of Karnataka) as the only child of a devout Śaiva couple, she had instinctively cultivated madhurabhakti, loving God Cannamallikārjuna (an aspect of Śiva) as her spouse. In her youth, Kauśika, the king of the place sought her hand in marriage. She married him after laying down certain conditions. When these conditions were broken by him she renounced the world and went away as a wandering minstrel. At Kalyāṇa in northern Karnataka she joined the group of devotees of the anubhava-maṇṭapa (a forum for discussion and exchange of views on spiritual life and experience) led by Basaveśvara and Allama Prabhu. After being initiated by Basaveśvara and feeling spiritual elevation, she retired to Śrīśaila (now in Andhra Pradesh) where she was &#x2018;united with her Lord Śiva,&#x2019; probably in A. D. 1166.</p>
			<p>Unlike the vacanas—a kind of lyrical prose—of Basaveśvara and others, her vacanas describe her longing for union with her divine spouse and the joy of fulfilment. A few of them also deal with the practical aspects of spiritual life.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Japa or repetition of a mantra (a set religious formula or a name of God or of a deity) is considered an important aspect of spiritual and religious discipline. Since a count of such repetition should be kept, devices for keeping such count are common to all religions. One important device is the mālā or rosary.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>A rosary made of rudrākṣa beads called akṣamālā (<em>Elaeocarpus ganitrus</em> or its berries) is very common. The number of beads may vary: 32, 54, 64 or 108. There will be one bead extra, which will be bigger than the others or fixed above the others. This is called &#x2018;meru&#x2019; and should not be crossed over during counting.</p>
			<p>Certain icons of gods (for e. g., Śiva, Sarasvatī, Brahmā) are shown with the akṣamālā in one of their hands.</p>
			<p>Vasiṣṭha&#x2019;s wife Arundhatī is sometimes known as Akṣamālā.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Classed under the Śaiva Upaniṣads (Upaniṣads dealing with the aspects connected with Śaivism) and belonging to the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, the <em>Akṣamālikā Upaniṣad</em> is a minor work in prose. It deals with the ritual consecration of a japamālā or rosary. It is in the form of a dialogue between Prajāpati and Guha (also known as Skanda, Kārttikeya and Subrahmaṇya, son of Pārvatī and Śiva), the latter being the preceptor.</p>
			<p>The japamālā can be made of beads of ten substances: coral, pearl, quartz, conch, silver, gold, sandalwood, seeds of putrajīvikā (<em>Roxburghii</em>), seeds of lotus and rudrākṣa (<em>Elaeocarpus</em> seeds). The string that holds them together can be made of gold, silver and copper, the three wires being twisted into one.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad then gives the process of contemplation on various deities like Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and Sarasvatī as situated in the various parts of the japamālā. This is followed by a ritualistic process of cleansing the japamālā with pañcagavya, the five products of a cow like milk and curds. (See <ref>PAÑCAGAVYA</ref>.) Then comes a long section describing the infusing of each of the beads with the power of the deities presiding over the fifty alphabets of the Sanskrit language, by relating one bead with one letter of the alphabet. This is repeated again after 50 beads. The appropriate mantras or esoteric formulae to be used are also given.</p>
			<p>After this, prayers are offered to the deities residing on earth, in the sky and in heaven, as also to the pitṛs or manes, to reside in the beads and make the japamālā holy and effective.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad ends with prayer to the rosary thus consecrated and a eulogy of this science given in it.</p>

			<p>Akṣapāda is identified with Gautama, the founder of the Nyāya-darśana (the Nyāya system of philosophy, of logical realism) and might have lived in the 3rd century B. C. The story goes that he was cross with Vyāsa who had criticised his philosophy and so vowed that he would never see him. Later on, realizing his mistake he produced through his yogic powers an eye in his foot through which he could see Vyāsa but could also maintain the earlier vow of not seeing him with the regular eyes.</p>

One of the departments described in detail is the &#x2018;akṣapaṭala,&#x2019; the department which preserved legal documents and records of accounts. The doors of this office building faced north or east with rooms for the clerical staff and sufficient accommodation for account books and documents. The adhyakṣa (superintendent) of this section had to maintain strictly all accounts pertaining to taxes, dues and fines and take measures to prevent embezzlement of State funds. It was also his duty to maintain a register of the dharma (customs, usages, methods of judicial procedures) of the various caste groups, families and corporations.</p>

			<p>Literally the word signifies anything that is not kṣara, not destructible, hence imperishable. The Upaniṣads use it to describe Brahman or even as its synonym. For example: <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> 3.8.8, 9, 10 and 11; <em>Kaṭha</em> 3.2; <em>Muṇḍaka</em> 1.1.5; 2.2.2 and so on. It is for this reason that the Hindu mythology uses the word as one of the many names of Śiva and Viṣṇu.</p>
			<p>Akṣara also signifies Praṇava or Om, the monosyllable that stands for the highest Brahman (<em>vide Bhagavadgītā</em> 8.13).</p>

			<p>Performing the śrāddha (obsequial ceremony) at Gayā (the famous place of pilgrimage in Bihar) has been a very ancient custom. One of the places where such śrāddha can be performed in Gayā is the Akṣayavaṭa, a huge Banyan tree considered to be extremely ancient. If piṇḍas (obsequial offering of rice balls) are offered under this tree to the departed ancestors, they are believed to enjoy its fruits eternally. Hence the appellation &#x2018;akṣaya&#x2019; (= imperishable; hence, eternal).</p>
			<p>The śrāddha at the Akṣayavaṭa is to be performed on the northern side at its bottom. Honouring the brāhmaṇas who assist in the ceremony and bowing to the tree itself are important aspects of this ritual.</p>
			<p>There is another Akṣayavaṭa in Prayāga (modern Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh). Death at its foot is considered to ensure attainment of the city of Viṣṇu.</p>
			<p>One more Akṣayavaṭa exists at Kāśī.</p>

			<p>Festivals and sacred days exist in all religions. They are usually the days associated with holy persons or memorable events. Akṣayya-tṛtīyā which falls on the 3rd day of śuklapakṣa (bright fortnight) of the month of Vaiśākha (April-May) is said to be the day on which the Kṛtayuga (the first of the four yugas or ages) began. Its name is derived from the fact that it falls on the third day of the lunar calendar month (tṛtīyā = the 3rd) and the religious merit acquired on this day becomes in-exhaustible (akṣaya).</p>
			<p>Fasting, worship of Lord Vāsudeva with whole grains of rice, study of Vedic texts, recitation of mantras, performance of homa (offerings into consecrated fire), offerings to the departed manes, gifts to brāhmaṇas—these are some of the observances recommended.</p>
			<p>Many tradesmen begin their new-year&#x2019;s business on this day.</p>
			<p>This is one of the days considered to be extremely auspicious during the year.</p>

			<p>Temples are an integral part of Hindu religion and culture. The building of a temple is considered a very sacred act. It is built according to a plan and pattern as given in the Āgamas. The image of the Chief Deity installed in the main shrine (garbhagṛha) is the central focus of the whole temple complex. This image is prepared strictly according to the rules of the mūrtiśilpaśāstras, works of Hindu iconography. Normally, even after completing the sculpturing of the image, its eyes will not be &#x2018;opened.&#x2019; This has to be done ceremonially before installing it. This process is called &#x2018;akṣimocana&#x2019; or &#x2018;netronmīlana.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The image is first placed on the sthaṇḍila (ground specially prepared for the purpose). The śilpi (sculptor) works on the eye with a golden needle opening the sight. After honouring him and bidding farewell the image is cleansed with five kinds of earth and five products of the cow (pañcagavya). It is then established on another sthaṇḍila with grains spread over. A brief worship is performed with gandha (sandal paste) and the image sprinkled with honey, milk and ghee. The sun, moon and fire are invoked into the (three) eyes. Finally it is bathed in scented water.</p>

			<p>Indian philosophical thought has reached its acme in the Upaniṣads. Coming as a reaction to Vedic ritualism and priestcraft it had to stress the need for realizing the spiritual dimensions of man. The sages of the Upaniṣads, with their deep insight into human nature, knew that a total break with the past would be rather difficult for the men steeped lifelong in rituals. Wishing to lead them to higher levels of spiritual experience, step by step, these sages devised several upāsanās or Vidyās (mystic meditations) often based on the same rituals which they practised.</p>
			<p>One of these Vidyās that occurs in the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (4.15 and 8.7.4) is the <em>Akṣipuruṣavidyā</em>. &#x2018;Akṣipuruṣa&#x2019; means &#x2018;the person seen in the eye.&#x2019; He is identified with the ātman. Obviously he cannot be the reflection seen in the eyeball. He is the person who animates the eye and enables it to see. Or he is the person seen through the inner eye after purifying the mind through disciplines like brahmacharya or celibacy. Actually he is the draṣṭā, the seer and not dṛśya, the seen. He is Brahman. Meditation upon him as the seer or even as the eye that sees everything else is <em>Akṣipuruṣavidyā.</em> The fruits of such meditation are believed to be obtaining all good things, shining in all worlds and after death, not being reborn.</p>

			<note />

		<description>
			<p>This is one of the minor Upaniṣads belonging to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>.</p>
			<p>It starts with the visit of the sage Sāṅkṛti to Ādityaloka, the world of Āditya or Sun-god, and pleasing him with a laudatory hymn. This hymn has been called &#x2018;cākṣuṣmatī-vidyā.&#x2019; The Sun-god who is the deity presiding over light in the external world and the power of sight in the bodies of living beings, declares that whosoever recites this hymn regularly everyday will not be affected by diseases of the eye. Since this Upaniṣad thus begins with a hymn connected with the &#x2018;akṣi&#x2019; or the eye, it has been named <em>Akṣi Upaniṣad</em>.</p>
			<p>The sage Sāṅkṛti then beseeches Lord Āditya to teach him Brahmavidyā or knowledge of Brahman. This question leads to a fairly long discourse by Āditya on quite a few of the well-known Vedāntic doctrines. A major part of this is devoted to a description of the seven bhūmis or planes of yogic state.</p>
			<p>In the first state, the yogi looks upon everything as the one, the unborn, indestructible, eternal Principle. This gradually leads to a natural dissolution of the mind wherein nothing except that one, is experienced. This is yoga. Trying to remain in that state, the yogi performs all actions. He is detached from all the internal mental impressions, but performs all good actions, actions which will not cause agitation in others&#x2019; minds. He loves all and speaks words suitable for the time and place. He serves the holy ones in all ways. He is interested in reflecting upon the holy scriptures.</p>
			<p>In the second state, the yogi approa-ches people well-versed in the scriptures and learns from them about śrutis (Vedas), smṛtis (secondary scriptures), sadācāra (good conduct) and yogic practices like dhāraṇā (attention) and dhyāna (meditation). He tries to transcend the six evils like pride and greed.</p>
			<p>In the third state he fixes his mind on the truths of the scriptures after hearing about them from the ṛṣis in the Vānaprastha stage of life. He observes hard austerities like lying on a bed of stone and roaming in the forests, to develop non-attachment. He develops great detachment to all the things of life—pairs of opposite—taking them as either due to the previous karma or as the will of God.</p>
			<p>In the fourth state, the yogi has transcended duality, is established in the advaita or non-dual state of consciousness and hence perceives the world only as a dream.</p>
			<p>In the fifth state, even this perception of the world as a dream disappears.</p>
			<p>In the sixth state, his mind gets attenuated further, advaitic consciousness becomes stronger, and doubts and bonds disappear. He is, for all practical purposes, a jīvanmukta or &#x2018;one who is liberated even while living.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The seventh state, which the Upaniṣad call s as &#x2018;videhamukti&#x2019; is characterized by total freedom from all bonds, rules and regulations and deep constant experience of the highest identity with Paramātman or Vāsudeva, the Supreme God.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Yoga is defined as union of the indi-vidual soul with the Supreme Soul through samādhi (perfect concentration, super-conscious experience). The path to this union is fraught with several obstacles. Of the nine obstacles technically known as &#x2018;antarāyas&#x2019; mentioned by Patañjali in his <em>Yogasūtras</em> (1.30) &#x2018;alabdhabhūmikatva&#x2019; is the eighth.</p>
			<p>In spite of the fact that the aspirant is correctly practising the various steps and disciplines of yoga, he fails to attain any of the yogabhūmis or planes of psychic and spiritual experience mentioned in the text books of yoga. This is called &#x2018;alabdha-bhūmikatva.&#x2019; This is primarily due to the evil saṁskāras or impressions carried over from past lives, which drain all the energy generated by yogic practices even as rat-holes in a field drain the water with which it is irrigated. With the help of the guru (spiritual preceptor) and by deep introspection he can discover his weaknesses and try to eliminate them by proper practices.</p>

			<p>Objects and scenes of natural beauty of this universe of phenomena have always fascinated the Hindu mind. Mountains, forests, rivers and seas have invariably provided the inspiration to build places of pilgrimage where human beings can contemplate the Divine and feel elevated.</p>
			<p>Of the many rivers of India, Gaṅgā (Ganges) stands unparallelled and supreme with regard to holiness and the number of places of pilgrimage associated with it. Alakanandā is one of its important tributaries which joins it at an early stage.</p>
			<p>Taking its birth on the Indo-Tibetan border of Uttar Pradesh, it is joined by Nandākinī at Nandaprayāga, by Piṇḍar at Karṇaprayāga and Mandākinī at Rudraprayāga. It joins Bhāgīrathī at Devaprayāga. Here-after the rivers merged together go by the name Gaṅgā. The famous Viṣṇu temple at Badarīnātha is situated on the bank of Alakanandā.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Vedic monasticism as expounded in the dharmaśāstras was practically reserved for the &#x2018;dvijas&#x2019; or the &#x2018;twice-born,&#x2019; members of the first three castes. Spiritual aspiration, especially the desire for mokṣa or liberation, being common to all human beings, persons from outside these three caste groups too have evolved their own way of monastic life and monastic orders. One of the many such groups is the &#x2018;Alakhnāmīs,&#x2019; also called &#x2018;Alakhgīrs&#x2019; and &#x2018;Alakhiyas.&#x2019; The word &#x2018;alakh&#x2019; is a corrupted Hindi form of the Sanskrit word &#x2018;alakṣya,&#x2019; the &#x2018;unseen.&#x2019; So, the &#x2018;Alakhnāmīs&#x2019; are those who take the name of the &#x2018;Unseen,&#x2019; the Supreme Brahman. They believe only in God without form.</p>
			<p>This sect is said to have been started by one Lāl or Lālgīr, a saint of the camār (shoemaker) caste. It is not known when he lived.</p>
			<p>Members of this sect are confined mostly to Bikanir in Rajasthan State. They wear a long blanket coat and a conical cap. While begging for alms or greeting one another they cry out &#x2018;Alakh kaho,&#x2019; &#x2018;Speak of the Unseen.&#x2019; They are gentle by nature and practise non-violence, catholicity and purity. They do not recognize caste system and disfavour visiting temples.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The created universe, having been projected out of God and sustained by Him, is naturally identified with Him. Hence evil is as much God as good is. It is another aspect, a reverse aspect as it were. This is a bold assertion made by Hinduism.</p>
			<p>If Lakṣmī is the goddess of wealth beauty and splendour, Alakṣmī, her opposite number, is misfortune personified. According to mythological accounts she was also born during samudramathana (&#x2018;churning of the ocean&#x2019;). Since she appeared earlier than Lakṣmī, she is also called &#x2018;Jyeṣṭhā&#x2019; (the elder one). A sage Dussaha (&#x2018;the unbearable&#x2019;) by name, married her. According to another version it was the sage Kapila. Adharma (unrighteousness) was their offspring.</p>
			<p>Alakṣmī is usually shown as an old hag riding a donkey. She has a broom in her hand. A crow adorns her banner. Her image finds a place in some temples. When propitiated, she can dispel evil and grant prosperity.</p>
			<p>She is sometimes identified with Lakṣmī herself.</p>
			<p>Being a part and parcel of this creation and hence of our life, misfortune is no less divinely ordained than fortune. It is perhaps to teach this great fact of life that even misfortune is deified.</p>

			<p>Alampur is a village on the bank of the Tuṅgabhadrā River in the Mahaboobnagar district of Andhra Pradesh. The village is renowned for the Nava-Brahmā temples (also known as Svarga-Brahmā temples) built in the 7th century A. D. Some of them are located within the same prākāra (outer wall). All are in the vesara style, a combination of the nāgara and drāviḍa styles, though the former aspect is more prominent. They appear to be the prototypes of the temples developed fully at Aihoḷe and Bādāmi now situated in the Karnataka State.</p>
			<p>Alampur has sometimes been called Dakṣiṇa Kāśī.</p>

			<p>A small town of the Maharashtra State, about 23 kms. (15 miles) from the city of Pune (Poona), it has acquired the status of a pilgrimage centre by its association with the greatest saint of Maharashtra, Sant Jñāneśvar or Jñāna-deva. The saint was born in A. D. 1271 here; and again it was here that he gave up the body in yoga in A. D. 1296. Thousands of devotees still believe that he lives in his subtle body in the cave where he went into samādhi.</p>
			<p>Every year, on the eleventh day of the dark half of Kārttīka (November—December), the day on which Jñāneśvar is said to have attained samādhi, there will be a huge congregation of devotees here to get his blessings.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;science of figure of speech&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Sanskrit language and Sanskrit literature have become an inalienable part of Hindu religion and culture. Even the earliest recorded specimens of Sanskrit literature have manifested the art of graceful speech. Several hymns of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> may be looked upon as genuine specimens of fine poetry. Various rhetorical devices now known as upamā (simile), rūpaka (metaphor) or atiśayokti (hyperbole) find an apt expression there in a natural way. The <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, though they are monumental works of wisdom and imagination, are also works exhibiting rare poetical skill.</p>
			<p>Alaṅkāraśāstra as a regular, independent, subject might not have existed in more ancient times. The first systematization started perhaps with the <em>Nāṭya-śāstra</em> of Bharata who might have existed some time during the period 200 B. C.—A.D. 400. Though primarily a work on dramaturgy, the origins of systematization of poetics as a science can be discovered here. However, it is Bhāmaha and Daṇḍin (6th cent. A.D.), Vāmana and Udbhaṭa (8th cent. A. D.), Rudraṭa and Ānandavardhana (9th cent. A. D.), Abhinavagupta, Kṣemendra and Mammaṭa (11th cent. A. D.) that have enriched the literature on poetics through their prolific writings of superb quality.</p>
			<p>The subject of alaṅkāra was viewed from different angles by different authors. This gave rise to eight sampradāyas or schools: rīti, guṇa, alaṅkāra, vakrokti, rasa, dhvani, anumāna and aucitya.</p>
			<p>Rīti is the way of writing. Though three rītis were originally recognized, they ultimately rose to six. The names given to them such as Vaidarbhī, Gauḍī or Māgadhī suggest that they were prevalent in particular regions. Daṇḍin and Vāmana were the forerunners of this school.</p>
			<p>Guṇa or quality may concern either the śabda (word) or the artha (meaning). It is very similar to the Rīti school. Originally enumerated as three, it gradually rose to ten. However this school got merged into the Alaṅkāra school. Vāmana was the chief exponent of this Guṇa school.</p>
			<p>Alaṅkāra is literary embellishment. It may be of śabda (word or sound) or artha (sense). The alaṅkāras rose from 38 in the early period to 200 in later days. Daṇḍin and Bhāmaha were the main propagators of this school.</p>
			<p>Vakrokti is equivocation. It is a mode of expression so that the listener conceives of a meaning different from that intended by the speaker or writer. Bhāmaha and Kuntaka (11th cent. A. D.) were the chief advocates of this school.</p>
			<p>Rasa is mood or sentiment, a genera-lized resultant emotion in the spectator or reader. Nine rasas, often called &#x2018;navarasas,&#x2019; have been advocated by the writers on prosody and dramatics. Bharata was the earliest exponent of the Rasa school followed by Udbhaṭa and others.</p>
			<p>Dhvani is suggestion. The theory of dhvani was introduced by Ānanda-vardhana.</p>
			<p>Anumāna refers to a sentiment that has to be inferred and experienced. Śaṅkula (9th cent A. D.) was the founder of this school.</p>
			<p>Aucitya means propriety. This school was propounded by Kṣemendra.</p>
			<p>Bharata&#x2019;s <em>Nāṭyaśāstra</em>, Bhāmaha&#x2019;s <em>Kāvyālaṅkāra</em>, Daṇḍin&#x2019;s <em>Kāvyādarśa</em>, Udbhaṭa&#x2019;s <em>Kāvyālaṅkāra-saṅgraha</em>,  Rudraṭa&#x2019;s <em>Kāvyālaṅkāra</em>, Ānandavardhana&#x2019;s <em>Dhvanyāloka</em> and Mammaṭa&#x2019;s <em>Kāvya-prakāśa</em></p>
			<p>are some of the standard works of Alaṅkāra-śāstra.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Ālasya or laziness is the worst enemy of man. When even material well-being is blocked by it, how can the lazy one hope for spiritual progress? That is why Patañjali, the great teacher of Yoga, has listed it as an antarāya or obstacle in the path of yoga (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 1.30). Since it is caused by an excess of tamas (dark element among the guṇas), it is to be overcome by rajas (activity) and sattva (dynamic goodness).</p>
			<p>Suśruta, the great teacher of Āyur-veda (Hindu system of medicine and surgery), considers ālasya as a condition which inclines a man more towards pleasure and less towards work, though capable (<em>vide Suśruta Saṁhitā, Śārīrasthāna</em>, 4.51).</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>When an alāta or a firebrand is moved quickly in circles or in any other way, it creates the illusion of circles or lines of fire. When the movement is stopped, the illusions also disappear. They were never produced by the firebrand in motion and hence never dissolve back into it when at rest.</p>
			<p>This is a typical example used by the Buddhist school known as <em>Vijñānavāda</em> and successfully adopted by the famous Advaitin Gauḍapāda (500 A. D.). According to the Vijñānavādins, vijñāna or mind, conjures up the external world which has no reality of its own. The mind with a series of succession of ideas is the only reality. The external world appears to be real even as the circle of fire appears to be.</p>
			<p>Gauḍapāda uses the same analogy to a different purpose. It is consciousness (or ātman) that appears in manifold forms due to māyā. In reality these do not come out of it, nor do they return to it, for they do not exist (<em>vide Māṇḍūkya Kārikā</em> on <em>Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad</em>, 4.47-52). The sole reality is the unchanging pure consciousness, śuddha-vijñaptimātra. This section of his <em>Kārikās</em> (the 4th) is named as <em>Alātaśānti-prakaraṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>The analogy of alātacakra (firebrand moved in circles) is pre-Buddhist and is found in the <em>Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad</em> 4.24.</p>

			<p>Man entertains numerous desires. He can successfully fulfil only a few of them by his own efforts through normal means. As long as the unfulfilled desires fill his heart he cannot have peace. Here comes the role of the śruti or the Vedas which prescribe certain specific rituals to obtain specific objects of desire by divine grace. These are the alaukika-upāyas or supernatural means, by resorting to which he can satisfy his desires legitimately.</p>
			<p>These include the Śyena-yāga or means for the destruction of the enemy. But the use of these methods is forbidden by the śruti itself and one has to be guided by its instructions. In this respect śruti is said to be like a light illuminating equally the path to be chosen and the thorn to be avoided. The choice is left to the person for whom guidance to choose properly has also been provided.</p>

			<p>Is the external world perceived through the senses real or unreal? If real, what is its nature? If unreal, what then, is the reality? These are the questions often raised and discussed by the Indian philosophical systems. The <em>Vijñānavāda</em> school of Buddhism (also called the <em>Yogācāra</em> school) denies reality to the external world and considers it as ideas or states of the internal vijñāna (consciousness or mind), which alone is real. This vijñāna is the ālaya or abode of all impressions. Hence the name &#x2018;ālaya-vijñāna.&#x2019; It is the potential mind similar to the ātman of other systems. However it is considered not as an unchanging substance, but as a stream of continuously changing states. Through proper culture it can gradually stop the arising of the undesirable mental states and develop into the ideal state of nirvāṇa (emancipation).</p>

In this posture, usually adopted in war or aggression, the left leg is bent at the knee and the right leg straight but slanting at an angle to the back. It is considered a standing posture. Fierce aspects of Śiva like Andhakāsura-mardana-mūrti and of Viṣṇu like Narasiṁha are shown in this posture.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;without sign&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Sāṅkhya system of Indian Philo-sophy posits pradhāna or prakṛti (nature, matrix of all created objects) as one of the two fundamental realities, the other reality being puruṣa (soul). Aliṅga is one of the synonyms of this prakṛti. Etymologically the word &#x2018;liṅga&#x2019; signifies a characte-ristic mark or an object that dissolves back in its cause. &#x2018;Aliṅga&#x2019; therefore is that which is the opposite of &#x2018;liṅga&#x2019;. Prakṛti or primordial nature with its three constituent guṇas in a state of perfect equilibrium is so subtle, that there is absolutely no manifest sign by which it can be perceived. It can only be inferred. Hence it is called &#x2018;avyakta&#x2019; (the unmanifest) and &#x2018;aliṅga&#x2019; (without characteristic signs). Being the original cause and the substratum of dissolution of all its products, it has no dissolution itself. Even in this sense it is &#x2018;aliṅga.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>For further details see <ref>PRADHĀNA</ref> and <ref>PRAKṚTI</ref>.</p>
			<p>See also <ref>SĀNKHYADARŚANA</ref>.</p>
			<p>The word is used in some of the Upaniṣads (<em>vide</em> <em>Kaṭha</em> 6.8 and <em>Maitrāyaṇī</em> 6.31, 35; 7.2) to indicate Ātman or Brahman since the latter has no liṅgas or signs by which it can be perceived by the senses or even the mind.</p>

			<p>Allama Prabhu (12th cent. A. D.) is perhaps the most important leader of the Vīraśaiva (Śaivism of Karnataka) Movement along with Basaveśvara. Born in Baḷḷigāvi (in the Shimoga dt. of Karna-taka) of the pious parents Nirahaṅkāra and Sujñāni, he showed extraordinary spiritual wisdom and maturity even as a child. According to one biographer Harihara, he was married in his youth to one Kāmalatā, but renounced the world when she died at a young age. Another incident mentioned is his &#x2018;conquest of Māyā,&#x2019; Māyā being a princess who fell in love with him. He successfully resisted her advances and continued his onward spiritual journey. It is perhaps this experience that is at the root of his vacana (lyrical prose composition) &#x2018;māyā is not in woman, but in the eye that beholds her.&#x2019; His intense desire to get enlightenment took him to a highly competent guru (spiritual teacher) Animiṣayya sitting in a guhā (cave). It was by his grace that he was filled with Śiva-consciousness and bliss. Hence he has used the pen-name &#x2018;Guheśvara&#x2019; in his compositions.</p>
			<p>He is said to have enlightened Gorakhnāth (another famous medieval saint) and many śivaśaraṇas (Vīraśaiva saints) like Basava, Siddharāma, Muktāyakka, Akka Mahādevī, Goggayya and others.</p>
			<p>His vacanas are a class by themselves and have successfully expressed deep spiritual experiences through wonderful similes.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Śrīvaiṣṇavism, the religion, and Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta, its philosophy, are of hoary antiquity. If the philosophy is traced to the Upaniṣads, the religion is traced to Lord Nārāyaṇa Himself. However, that Śrīvaiṣṇavism is basically the Bhāgavata religion rooted in the Vaiṣṇavite scriptures like the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> section of the <em>Mahābhārata, Viṣṇupurāṇa, Bhāgavata</em> and the <em>Pāñcarātra</em> works is conceded. The Āḷvārs are important, even pioneering, leaders of this religious cult.</p>
			<p>Literally, the word &#x2018;āḷvār&#x2019; means &#x2018;one who is immersed deeply&#x2019; (in God). The Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition recognizes twelve such Āḷvārs. All of them belonged to Tamil Nadu and lived during the Pallava period (7th to 9th cent. A. D.).</p>
			<p>The first three Āḷvārs—Poygai, Pūdam (Bhūta) and Pey—were contemporaries. Since they spent most of their time laughing and singing, weeping or dancing, people considered them as spirits or mad beings. The work <em>Tiruvandādi</em>, of 300 verses, is jointly ascribed to them.</p>
			<p>Tirumaḷiśai, the fourth was an abandoned child brought up by a hunter couple. His two works <em>Nānmukhan Tiruvandādi</em> and <em>Tiruccandaviruttam</em> are a fine combi-nation of devotional fervour as well as metaphysical acumen.</p>
			<p>The next was Kulaśekhara, the king of Travancore, who was never affected by wealth, pleasures or power but always lived as a true servant of God. His exqui-site Sanskrit hymn, the <em>Mukundamālā</em>, is considered a rare combination of devotion and poetic beauty. <em>Perumāḷ Tirumoḷi</em> is his other work (in Tamil).</p>
			<p>Periyāḷvār or Viṣṇucitta, an orthodox brāhmaṇa is the sixth in the series. A resident of Śrīviḷḷiputtūr, famous for its temple dedicated to child Śrī Kṛṣṇa (known as Vaṭapatraśāyin, &#x2018;one who is lying on the Banyan leaf &#x2019;) he delighted in spending most of his time in gathering flowers and preparing garlands for the Lord. He loved the Lord with a motherly heart like Yaśodā. His famous work, the <em>Tirupallāṇḍu</em>, gives a fine description of the Lord going in a procession. However, the verses also contain prayers for the protec-tion of the Lord&#x2019;s beauty! A study of the works of the Āḷvārs (called <em>Nālāyira Prabandham</em>) is invariably prefaced by <em>Tirupallāṇḍu</em> and also concluded with it. <em>Tirumoḷi</em>, the other work of Periyāḷvār, contains a good description of the childish pranks of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as seen by mother Yaśodā.</p>
			<p>Āṇḍāḷ (also known as Godādevī) the seventh, was the adopted daughter of Periyāḷvār. She is the only woman among the Āḷvārs. Tradition considers her as the avatāra (incarnation) of Lakṣmī or Bhūdevī. Refusing to wed any man, she led the life of a lover of the Lord, like the gopīs of Vṛndāvan. Her work <em>Tiruppāvai</em> consisting of 30 pāśuras or verses is extremely popular among the Śrīvaiṣṇa-vas. Even today it is sung and discoursed upon regularly during the month of Dhanuṣ (when the sun enters the Zodiacal sign of Sagittarius). <em>Nācciyār Tirumoḷi</em> is her other work. She is said to have disappeared into the image of Lord Raṅganātha at Śrīraṅgam (Tamil Nadu).</p>
			<p>The eighth, Toṇḍaraḍippoḍi Āḷvār, is a glorious example of a fallen soul redeemed by repentance and service to the holy ones. Known as Vipranārāyaṇa, an orthodox brāhmaṇa puṇḍit, he was enticed into evil ways of life by a courtesan. When she deserted him he woke up to the great tragedy. By serving the devotees of God and considering himself as the dust of their feet (that is the meaning of the word &#x2018;toṇḍara-aḍi-ppoḍi&#x2019;) he gradually purified himself and rose to supreme heights of devotion. <em>Tirupaḷḷiyeḷucci</em> and <em>Tirumālai</em> are the works attributed to him.</p>
			<p>Tiruppāṇi, the ninth Āḷvār, was a pariah who lived in a hut near the Śrīraṅgam temple. He was a musician saint. It is said that Lord Raṅganātha commanded the chief priest to carry this saint on his shoulders into the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em> where he merged with Him. <em>Amalanādippirān</em> was composed by him.</p>
			<p>Tirumaṅgai Āḷvār, the next in the series, was a highway robber turned a saint. Six works beginning with <em>Periya Tirumoḷi</em> are attributed to him. He is said to have excelled in four types of poetic composition.</p>
			<p>Madhurakavi Āḷvār and Nammāḷvār were contemporaries and their lives were interwoven. The former, a brāhmaṇa, accepted the latter, though of low caste, as his spiritual preceptor. Nammāḷvār, also called Māran, Parāṅkuśar or Śaṭhakopar, is regarded as the greatest of all the Āḷvārs. His four works are: <em>Tiruviruttam, Tiruvāśiriyam, Periya Tiruvandādi</em> and <em>Tiruvāimoḷi</em>. These are exquisite works describing his profound spiritual experiences. Out of these, the last work with 1102 verses is well-known and widely studied.</p>
			<p>The whole mass of compositions of the Āḷvārs is known as <em>Nālāyira Prabandham</em> (because it numbers 4000), or <em>Divya Prabandham</em>. They are regarded in status as equal to the Vedas. Hence the name &#x2018;Drāviḍa Veda.&#x2019; The Viśiṣṭā-dvaita system which has accorded an equal status to the Vedas and the <em>Divya Prabandhams</em> is incidentally known as &#x2018;Ubhaya Vedānta&#x2019; (ubhaya = two, both).</p>
			<p>The teachings of these Āḷvārs can be briefly summarised as follows: Nārāyaṇa is the supreme Lord. He is both immanent and transcendent. He is the personification of all perfection. Apart from incarnating himself as Rāma or Kṛṣṇa, he is manifesting himself in the icons that are devoutly worshipped, as &#x2018;arcāvatāra.&#x2019; Devotion to him, devoted service to him, total surrender to him (called prapatti) is the surest and the easiest way of attaining him.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These are technical terms used in Hindu temple architecture. The crown of a Nāgara style of a temple (with curvilinear towers found mostly in North and North-east India) is called āmalaka for the simple reason that it resembles an āmalaka fruit (myrobalan) in shape. It is a solid ring stone with a cogged rim. It forms the crown of the main śikhara (dome) as also subsidiary śikharas. It clasps the veṇu or the central shaft of the structure. It is not found in the Drāviḍa temples.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Sometimes, above the usual āmalaka, there may be a smaller one of similar shape. In this case, the lower one is called āmalasāra and the upper (smaller) one āmalasārī.</p>
			<p>The āmalaka is the architectural symbol of the celestial world.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Inviting brāhmaṇas for partaking the food during a śrāddha ceremony is an important part of that ritual. The dharma-śāstras prescribe elaborate rules with regard to the type of brāhmaṇas to be invited and also the mode of inviting them.</p>
			<p>The two words constantly used in this connection are &#x2018;āmantraṇa&#x2019; and &#x2018;nimantraṇa.&#x2019; Though they are often used synonymously, subtle distinctions are sometimes made. A &#x2018;nimantraṇa&#x2019; is more or less compulsory to accept. If the invitee rejects it without proper grounds, he is said to incur sin. But &#x2018;āmantraṇa&#x2019; does not imply compulsion. The invitee has much greater freedom to accept or reject it.</p>

			<p>Places of pilgrimage have exercised enormous influence on the Hindu society. They have contributed not a little, to the preservation of Hindu religion and culture. A river, a mountain, a forest, the seashore or for that matter, any place of natural solitude and beauty—have always attracted the devout and the holy, making them in course of time a regular place of pilgrimage.</p>
			<p>Amarakaṇṭaka hill belonging to the Mekala mountain range in the Bilaspur district of Madhya Pradesh is the place of origin of the famous river Narmadā. One of the cities of Bāṇāsura destroyed by the arrow of Lord Śiva is said to have fallen here. Śrāddha performed here is said to yield great results. It is believed that a person committing religious suicide here, by fasting or by jumping into fire or water, after purifying himself through certain vows like that of brahmacarya (celibacy) and ahiṁsā (non-violence), will attain mukti or liberation. Even a visit, especially on the days of lunar and solar eclipses, is highly eulogised.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;immortal lexicon&#x2019; or &#x2018;Lexicon of Amarasiṁha&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Lexicography is one of the important branches of technical literature in Sans-krit. The <em>Nighaṇṭu</em>, a vocabulary of Vedic words, is the oldest lexicon so far known. The <em>Nirukta</em> of Yāska (800 B. C.) is a commentary on it.</p>
			<p>But among the extant lexicons of Sanskrit, the <em>Amarakoṣa</em> (also spelt as <em>Amarakośa</em>) of Amarasiṁha (A. D. 500), a Buddhist scholar, who might have adorned the court of Vikramāditya, is the best known and the most widely used.</p>
			<p>Popularly known as the <em>Nāma-liṅgānuśāsanam</em> (&#x2018;a work which deals with vocables and their genders&#x2019;), it is divided into three &#x2018;kāṇḍas&#x2019; or books or sections. (Hence the name <em>Trikāṇḍa</em> also.) The first called <em>Svargakāṇḍa</em> deals with heavenly matters. The second called <em>Bhūmikāṇḍa</em> deals with earthly things. The third called <em>Sāmānyakāṇḍa</em> is concerned with general matters.</p>
			<p>The whole work is in poetry, in the anuṣṭubh metre. The major part of the work deals with synonyms and only a small section called <em>Nānārthavarga</em> is devoted to homonyms.</p>
			<p>Being the most popular of such lexicons, the <em>Amarakoṣa</em> has sixty commentaries. Out of them the <em>Amarakoṣod-ghāṭana</em> by Kṣīrasvāmin (11th cent A. D.) seems to be the earliest. <em>Ṭīkāsarvasva</em> of Sarvānanda (12th cent. A. D.) is a more scholarly work.</p>

			<p>Pilgrimage to holy places is an integral part of the religious observances of the Hindus. Though the number of such places in India is extremely large, only a few have attained great celebrity over the centuries. The Amaranātha (Śiva) cave in Kashmir is one such. Its importance and antiquity were well-known even by the twelfth century since Kalhaṇa&#x2019;s <em>Rāja-taraṅgiṇī</em> mentions it.</p>
			<p>Situated in the Himalayan ranges at a height of about 4300 metres (13,000 ft.) it lies to the north-east of Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, at a distance of 138 kms. (86 miles.) It is a big natural cave about 45 metres (150 ft.) in height, 30 metres (100 ft.) wide and 60 metres (200 ft.) in length. Except for a small area, most of the roof leaks. There are two holes in the northern wall of the cave from which water trickles out and freezes into ice almost immediately. One of the holes is bigger and below that a huge liṅga of snow is formed. This is the famous Amaranātha-liṅga. On its left and right sides there are two more formations of ice, known respectively as Gaṇeśa and Pārvatī. The cave faces south and the rays of the sun do not fall directly on the liṅga.</p>
			<p>There is a traditional belief that the snow liṅga gets formed every lunar month in the bright half and gets dissolved during the dark half. Thus there is no liṅga on the new-moon day and the liṅga attains its maximum size on the full-moon day. Even <em>Ain-i-Akbari</em> of Abul Fazal (16th cent.) mentions this belief.</p>
			<p>Visiting the cave-temple on the Śrāvaṇapūrṇimā day (July—August) is considered extremely auspicious since, according to the mythological lore, Śiva appeared in this cave on this day. He made the gods immortal by feeding them with amṛta or nectar. Hence the name Amara-nātha, &#x2018;Lord of the immortals&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The pilgrims travel in a group from Srinagar. The government makes elaborate arrangements for their comfort and safety.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The purāṇas (Hindu mythological works) delight in describing Amarāvatī, the capital of Indra&#x2019;s paradise. Situated on the eastern side of Mt. Meru it is said to have a thousand gates and a hundred palaces. Full of fragrant flowers and sacred trees and with celestial chariots moving at will, it is the abode of a variety of celestial beings like devas, siddhas, apsaras, gandharvas and others. It can be attained only by those who have performed sacrifices and practised severe penance as also those who die on the battlefield.</p>
			<p>There is an Amarāvatī in Andhra Pradesh, situated on the south bank of the river Kṛṣṇā, about 32 kms. (20 miles) from Guntur. Though a small village now, it was formerly a flourishing city by name Dhānyakaṭaka, the capital of the Śālīvāhana empire (2nd and 3rd cent. A.D.). The Amareśvara temple and the Śivarātri celebrations there were famous even by the tenth century A.D. The discovery in A.D. 1798 of parts of a stūpa by Col. Mackenzie has put Amarāvatī firmly on the architectural map of India. The great stūpa which took shape between 200 B. C. and A. D. 200 and which was bigger than the Sāñcī stūpa must have been 49 metres (162 ft.) in diameter and about 37 metres (120 ft.) in height. The works of sculpture, most of which are in the British Museum, are exquisitely beautiful carvings, mostly in limestone.</p>

			<word>Amar Dās, Guru</word>
			<note>(A. D. 1479—1574)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Third in the hierarchy of the Gurus of Sikhism, Guru Amar Dās has left an indelible impression on the religion and society of the Sikhs during the formative period. Born in A. D. 1479 as the son of Tej Bhān and Sulakhnī (also known as Lakho or Lachmi) in the village Basarke (near the modern Basarke Gillan in the Amritsar district of Punjab), Amar Dās had practically no formal education. Though engaged in trade, the family profession, he had an innate interest in religion which often took him to several places of pilgrimage, especially Hardvār. His strong build enabled him to perform austerities and withstand the rigours of pilgrimages in which he had great faith, imbibed by his deep acquaintance with the Hindu religious traditions. Married to Manasā Devī, he begot two daughters and two sons. Bībī Bhāni, the younger daughter, was later on given in marriage to Rām Dās (nicknamed Jeṭha) who succeeded him as the next Guru.</p>
			<p>His quest for inner peace ended when he met Guru Aṅgad. It was Bībī Amro, a daughter of Guru Aṅgad that was instrumental in bringing about this meeting. During his long probation of twelve years under the Guru, Amar Dās had to unlearn many a Hindu custom and deliberately cultivate the Sikh way of life. After he gained Guru Aṅgad&#x2019;s confidence, he was directed to return to his family and lead the normal life of a householder.</p>
			<p>At the bidding of his Guru, Amar Dās built the town of Gobindwal, more familiarly called Goindwal, and started living there. It is said that he used to carry the water of the Beas River everyday from Goindwal where he lived, to Khadur where Guru Aṅgad lived, for the Guru&#x2019;s service. This steady and devoted service to the Guru Aṅgad gained him the Guru&#x2019;s grace who finally decided to ordain him as the next Guru. Amar Dās was nearly 73 years old when the Guru&#x2019;s mantle fell on him in A.D. 1552. Dātu, the first son of Guru Aṅgad, who felt he had been deprived of the Guruship that &#x2018;legitimately&#x2019; belonged to him, harassed Guru Amar Dās so much that the latter left Goindwal for an unknown destination. The distressed disciples approached the elderly saint Bhai Buddha on whose suggestion, the Guru&#x2019;s mare was let free. The mare led them to the Guru&#x2019;s hiding place. He was persuaded to return.</p>
			<p>Guru Amar Dās trained a number of apostles to spread the message of Sikhism. He is also credited with the performance of several miracles like reviving a dead man, curing a lame devotee as also a mad queen.</p>
			<p>The Mughal emperor Akbar is said to have sought audience with the Guru and was impressed by him very much.</p>
			<p>Having had a premonition of the approaching death, Guru Amar Dās appointed Rām Dās, his son-in-law, as the next Guru in A. D. 1574 and shed his mortal coil soon after.</p>
			<p>His contribution to the contents of the <em>Guru Granth Sāhib</em> was the third largest. His service to the growth and development of the Sikh community was of a high order.</p>

			<p>It is obligatory on the part of every Hindu to perform śrāddha, a religious rite to please and to benefit the dead ancestors. It is normally performed, with the offerings of cooked food. However, there are occasions like journey or aśauca (cere-monial impurity caused by the birth of a son and so on) when this will not be possible. The dharmaśāstras advise that on such occasions āmaśrāddha can be performed. Other things being the same, uncooked grains take the place of cooked food, the quantity of the grains being 2 to 4 times the grains required for offering cooked food. Āmaśrāddha is always prescribed for śūdras.</p>

		<description>
			<p>No civilized life is possible without the protecting hand of a king or a ruler. Among the seven aṅgas or constituents of a State (rājya), the amātya (minister) occupies a place next only to that of the king. The other two words that are commonly used to denote a minister are &#x2018;saciva&#x2019; and &#x2018;mantrin.&#x2019; The &#x2018;saciva&#x2019; is a helper or a comrade. The &#x2018;mantrin&#x2019; is one who is capable of giving counsel and keeping secrets.</p>
			<p>Sometimes the ministers are divided into two groups: dhīsacivas or matisacivas and karmasacivas. The former are also called mantris and are concerned with giving suitable counsel. The latter are responsible for implementing the decisions taken.</p>
			<p>Various views are given with regard to the number of ministers in a king&#x2019;s cabinet. The number usually ranges from 8 to 20 or more.</p>
			<p>Though it is obligatory on the part of the king to appoint ministers, it is equally obligatory to test them properly and thoroughly before doing so. Kauṭilya, for instance, lays down (<em>Arthaśāstra </em>1.10) that the would-be amātyas are to be tested by upadhās (tests of honesty). The tests are designed to make them swerve from the path of their duty (dharma) by tempting them through wealth or woman (artha and kāma) or by threats (bhaya), and are conducted secretly.</p>
			<p>The ministers, though loyal to the king, were also expected to secure the confidence of the pauras and jānapadas (i.e., the people). This would call for the utmost exercise of tact and courage.</p>
			<p>The posts were usually hereditary though the king had the option not to appoint them as ministers if found not suitable.</p>

		<description>
			<p>If full-moon has fascinated the ancient man, new-moon must have induced a sort of anxiety and fear. In the Hindu religion, amāvāsyā or new-moon has been raised to the status of a deity capable of bestowing wealth and valiant sons on the supplicant (<em>vide Atharvaveda</em> 7.79[84].2).</p>
			<p>On this day the moon is not visible from the earth. She is believed to be with the sun (amā = near, vāsyā = living), and is seen only by the sun. Hence the other name &#x2018;darśa&#x2019; for amāvāsyā.</p>
			<p>Two kinds of amāvāsyās are recognised: sinīvālī when it is mixed with caturdaśī tithi (the 14th day after fullmoon) and kuhū when mixed with pratipad (the 1st day after new-moon). Even these are sometimes referred to as deities who can be supplicated.</p>
			<p>One of the well-known Vedic sacrifices, the Darśa, has to be compulsorily performed on this day.</p>
			<p>Amāvāsyā falling on Monday, Tuesday or Thursday is considered as especially holy. So also, if it is associated with the nakṣatras as Anūrādhā, Viśākhā or Svātī. Several vratas (religious observances) are recommended to be performed on such days.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Though a general word, meaning &#x2018;mother,&#x2019; it is more often used as a proper noun, as a name of one of the aspects of Pārvatī, the divine spouse of Lord Śiva. Said to be of the colour of water lily, she is depicted with four hands, carrying pāśa (noose), padma (lotus) and pātra (vessel) in three hands whereas the fourth one is exhibiting the abhayamudrā (pose assuring freedom from fear).</p>
			<p>Mother Durgā is also sometimes called Ambā.</p>
			<p>The first daughter of the king of Kāśī was also named Ambā. Ambikā and Ambālikā were her sisters. Bhīṣma brought the three sisters by force during their svayaṁvara. When he learnt that Ambā had already been betrothed to the king Saubha, he sent her to him. However the king Saubha refused to accept her. She returned and pressed Bhīṣma himself to marry her. He refused her request since he had vowed to remain celibate. Incensed by this, she performed austerities to kill Bhīṣma, was reborn as Śikhaṇḍī (an offspring of Drupada) and ultimately killed him in the Mahābhārata war.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Ambarīṣa was an emperor belonging to the Sūryavaṁśa and the Ikṣvāku lineage. A worthy son of a worthy father (Māndhātṛ), Ambarīṣa was deeply devoted to Lord Viṣṇu. He was very meticulous in observing the fast on ekādaśīs (11th day after new-moon or full-moon, on which day fasting is obligatory). Durvāsas, a sage known for his short temper, once attemp-ted to make him swerve from the rules of the ritual but failed in his efforts. Actually the tables were turned against him. The Sudarśanacakra (discus of Lord Viṣṇu) pursued him relentlessly until he had to seek the forgiveness and deliverance from the king Ambarīṣa himself. (For details see <em>Bhāgavatam</em> 9.4, 5.)</p>
			<p>There was another Ambarīṣa, the son of Nābhāga. He was known for his generosity and devotion.</p>
			<p>In the <em>Rāmāyaṇa (Bālakāṇḍa</em>, 61) we come across yet another Ambarīṣa who lost the yajñapaśu (the sacrificial animal) during the conduct of a sacrifice and was advised to substitute the lost animal with a human being. Śunaśśepha, the middle son of a sage Ṛcīka, was purchased for this purpose. But the boy was ultimately saved by the dynamic sage Viśvāmitra.</p>
			<p>Śunaśśepha&#x2019;s story appears in some purāṇas with variations in which Hariś-candra is the king and not Ambarīṣa.</p>
			<p>The <em> Mahābhārata </em> contains an <em>Ambarīṣa-Gītā (Anugītā-parva</em>, 12). After attaining perfection Ambarīṣa teaches that lobha (greed) is a great enemy responsible for spiritual disaster, and hence it must be rooted out.</p>

			<p>When the caste system was born in the Hindu society, the seed of admixture of castes was also sown. Even as early as the Mahābhārata period, such admixture (varṇasaṅkara) was deplored. One of the several castes born out of such admixture is the ambaṣṭha, the offspring of a brāhmaṇa father and a vaiśya mother. Practice of medicine and surgery as also agriculture are the professions recommended for this caste. Some books make the ambaṣṭha the offspring of a kṣattriya father from a vaiśya mother. Fighting is the vocation recommended.</p>
			<p>Ambaṣṭha seems to be the name of a country also. A king, Āmbaṣṭhya, is said to have performed Aśvamedha sacrifice (<em>vide Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</em> 39.7). <em>Mahā-bhārata</em> mentions another king Ambaṣṭha who fought on the side of the Kauravas and met his death at the hands of Arjuna. Kaṁsa&#x2019;s mahout who tried to assassinate Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa was also known as Ambaṣṭha.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;fixing the mind on the water principle&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>It is one of the five dhāraṇās techni-cally known as &#x2018;pañcadhāraṇās&#x2019; in the works on Haṭhayoga. Such dhāraṇās help in the conquest of the mind. When guided properly, this can lead to the realization of the Self. Incidentally, certain super-normal powers are also attained in the process.</p>
			<p>Āmbhasī-dhāraṇa is dhāraṇā or fixing the mind on the principle of ambhas or water. The water principle is white like the kunda flower or conch or moon. It is circular in form with Viṣṇu as the presiding deity and &#x2018;va&#x2019; as the bīja (seed-letter). Fixing the mind along with the prāṇa (through kumbhaka prāṇāyāma) for five ghaṭikās (one ghaṭikā = 24 minutes) will help the yogi to destroy all sorrows. The yogi who has perfected this will not die even in deepest water.</p>

			<p>The Vedas, the basic scriptures of Hinduism, are known by several other names: śruti, āmnāya and trayī. They are called &#x2018;śruti&#x2019; since they are &#x2018;heard&#x2019; (śru = to hear) by the disciples from the mouth of the teacher. They are &#x2018;trayī,&#x2019; &#x2018;a group of three&#x2019; since <em>Ṛgveda, Yajurveda</em> and <em>Sāmaveda</em>, the three earlier compilations were always considered together. They are known as &#x2018;āmnāya&#x2019; since they are learnt by rote, committed to memory (mnā = to commit to memory, to repeat) and are handed down traditionally from the teacher to the disciple.</p>

			<p>Guru Gobind Singh (A. D. 1666—1708) formed the Khālsā (lit., &#x2018;personification of the guru&#x2019;) an army of baptised Sikhs. The process of baptism consisted of stirring water in an iron bowl with a double-edged sword, mixing it with sugar and drinking it, as also sprinkling it on the face. Sacred verses from the <em>Guru Granth Sāhib</em> were uttered during the stirring. The water itself was called &#x2018;amṛt&#x2019; or nectar. The procedure is followed even now.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The desire to become immortal is most natural to all mortals. Hindu mytho-logy often mentions &#x2018;amṛta,&#x2019; the nectar or ambrosia, by drinking which one can become immortal. The story goes that Indra, the king of gods, lost his all to the demons, owing to the curse of the sage Durvāsas, whom he had displeased. Lord Viṣṇu advised him to make up with the demons and with their help, to churn the ocean of milk, out of which amṛta could be got. By drinking it the gods could become immortal and regain their lost sovereignty. Amṛta was the last product got out of this churning. Lord Viṣṇu, in the guise of Mohinī (the enchantress) successfully deceived the demons and served it to the gods. Inebriated by the new strength and vigour got out of consuming it, the gods routed the demons and regained all they had lost.</p>
			<p>See <ref>SAMUDRAMATHANA</ref> for details.</p>
			<p>Garuḍa is said to have brought it from heaven to give it to Kadrū, his aunt, to release his mother Vinatā from her slavery. So also, Kṛṣṇa is believed to have got it for the sage Udaṅka.</p>
			<p>The word amṛta is also used in several other senses. For instance: God, moon, liberation, what is left over after a sacrifice, food obtained without begging, milk, ghee, an auspicious time of conjunction of certain nakṣatras (stars) with certain week days and so on. The last is also known as &#x2018;amṛtasiddhiyoga.&#x2019;</p>

			<word>Amṛtabindu Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a minor Upaniṣad of just 22 verses belonging to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>.</p>
			<p>It starts with an oft-quoted statement that it is the mind that is responsible for either bondage or liberation. When attached to sense objects it leads to bondage; when freed from the same, it leads to liberation. Hence it should be freed from the bondage of sense-life.</p>
			<p>It then delineates the process of meditation by which the mind bereft of sense-attachments is fixed in the region of the heart on Brahman. Meditation on Brahman can be practised first through the sound of Om, and then directly.</p>
			<p>This is followed by an exposition of Brahman-ātman with the usual adjectives like niṣkalam (partless), nirañjanam (stainless), aprameyam (immeasurable) and so on. Then the Upaniṣad describes how Brahman, the one without a second, appears as many, with the simile of moon and its reflections in water, and, the sky and pots.</p>
			<p>It puts forth the theory of two kinds of knowledge, of Śabda-Brahman and Para-Brahman.</p>
			<p>The former is the Vedas and their branches. A mastering of these can help in leading to the latter, which has to be realized through contemplation. This contemplation is likened to the process of churning milk to get butter, or churning the pieces of araṇi (See <ref>ARAṆI</ref>.) to get fire. The Upaniṣad ends with a statement of the jñānī, a man of realization, reflecting on his realization of his identity with Brahman.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that there is another Upaniṣad called <em>Brahmabindu Upaniṣad</em> which is almost identical with this Upaniṣad.</p>

			<note />

		<description>
			<p>This is a small Upaniṣad of 38 verses belonging to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em> and classified among the &#x2018;Yoga Upaniṣads&#x2019; since the subject matter relates to yoga.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad starts with the exhortation to study the scriptures like the Vedas and their accessories, practise the disciplines taught there, realize the highest Brahman and then, give up these scriptures since the purpose of life will have been accomplished.</p>
			<p>This is followed by a simile of the chariot in which Om is the chariot and Viṣṇu (= buddhi or intellect) is the charioteer. The aspirant devoted to Rudra (his own Self) and desirous of attaining Brahmaloka or the abode of Brahman, travels in that chariot as far as it goes and then abandons it. The idea is that the aspirant while repeating Om thinks of &#x2018;Rudra&#x2019; or his own Self as identified with Brahman, through his intellect. When this identity is felt, he abandons the repetition of Om but proceeds to make his meditation deeper, ultimately resulting in direct experience of that oneness.</p>
			<p>Then comes the description of &#x2018;Ṣaḍaṅga-yoga&#x2019; or yoga comprising six steps. They are: pratyāhāra, dhyāna, prāṇāyāma, dhāraṇā, tarka and samādhi. Pratyāhāra (lit., withdrawal of the mind from the senses) is defined here as thinking of the mind and the sense-objects as &#x2018;rays emanating from the ātman&#x2019; thus neutralizing their effects. Dhyāna is meditation on the oneness of ātman with Brahman. Prāṇāyāma is regulation of breath, and through that, regulation of the vital energies or prāṇas. Dhāraṇā or fixing the mind on the objects of meditation, is the earlier stage of dhyāna. Tarka is logic, not opposed to the teachings of the Vedas. Samādhi is the direct experience of the oneness of the ātman with Brahman.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad gives some details of the process of prāṇāyāma, positions and fields of operation of the five prāṇas, certain obstacles to yoga like fear, anger and laziness which must be overcome and a few other details connected with yogic practices. It concludes with the statements that if a yogi has mastered the techniques of raising his prāṇa through the various plexuses up to the centre of the head, his prāṇa will depart, at the time of death, through the brahmarandhra (aperture in the crown of the head) whatever be the manner of his death, and so, he is never reborn.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>All living beings are naturally and instinctively struggling for freedom from sorrow and suffering. So also do they seek pleasure and happiness. The Upaniṣads, the ancient and basic works of Hinduism, call this state &#x2018;amṛtatva,&#x2019; the state of immortality and bliss. Mokṣa, mukti, nirvāṇa and kaivalya are some of the more common synonyms of the same.</p>
			<p>All the Hindu scriptures are unanimous that</p>
			<ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>amṛtatva is the goal of human life;</li>
				<li>the human beings desirous of obtaining it should purify themselves by giving up evil ways of life;</li>
				<li>they should take recourse to the śāstras (holy books) and ācārya (spiritual preceptor), and practise jñāna (knowledge) as also bhakti (devotion) to reach that goal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once this goal of amṛtatva is obtained, there is no return to this life of transmigration. The liberated soul will enjoy eternal bliss.</p>
			<p>Details of the path as also the nature of amṛtatva differ from school to school of religious philosophies.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Amṛtsar or Amritsar is the principal holy city of the Sikhs. It is in Punjab and is also the district headquarters.</p>
			<p>The foundation of the city was laid by guru Rāmdās (A. D. 1534-1581), the fourth Guru of Sikhism, when he inaugurated the digging of the holy tank &#x2018;Amṛt-sar&#x2019; (&#x2018;lake of nectar&#x2019;) on a piece of land purchased from the residents of the neighbouring village of Tuṅg during the time of the previous Guru, Amardās (A. D. 1479-1574). The habitation that grew round the holy lake was initially called &#x2018;Rāmdāspur&#x2019; or &#x2018;Chakk Rāmdās&#x2019; or &#x2018;Chakk Guru&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Guru Arjan (A. D. 1563-1606) comple-ted and lined the tank. He also constructed the holy shrine in its middle, &#x201c;Harimandar&#x2019; (now famous as the Golden Temple).</p>
			<p>Guru Hargobind (A. D. 1595-1644) constructed the Akāl Takht (&#x2018;Throne of the Eternal&#x2019;) near the pool. He also got dug up two more tanks in the town, known as &#x2018;Kaulsar&#x2019; and &#x2018;Bibeksar&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>During the eighteenth century, Amṛtsar witnessed many ups and downs like the Sikh community. It suffered repeatedly, desecration and destruction at the hands of the Muslim rulers of Delhi. Only by the time of Mahārājā Raṇjit Singh (A. D. 1780-1830) order and peace were established.</p>
			<p>Amṛtsar gradually grew into an important industrial and commercial city.</p>
			<p>Amṛtsar has many Sikh shrines associated with the memory of the Gurus, martyrs and heroes. Some of them are: Akāl Buṅga, Gurdwārā Dukh Bhañjanī Berī, Gurdwārā Tharhā Sāhib, Gurdwārā Mañjī Sāhib, Gurdwārā Guruke Mahal, Bābā Aṭal Sāhib, Gurdwārā Rāmsar, Gurdwārā Bibeksar, Gurdwārā Darśanī Diorhī, Gurdwārā Damdamā Sāhib and so on.</p>

			<p>Emperor Sagara of Sūryavaṁśa (race descended from the sun) once started the Aśvamedha sacrifice (horse-sacrifice). When the sacrificial horse was lost, his sons went out in search of it and found it grazing in the monastery of the sage Kapila. The disrespect shown by them to the sage resulted in their being reduced to ashes. Aṁśumān the grandson of Sagara then set out in search of the horse and his uncles. When he discovered the horse and the tragedy, he pacified the sage and brought back the horse so that Sagara could complete the sacrifice without further hitch. After the completion of the sacrifice, Aṁśumān became the king and ruled for some time. Then he left his kingdom in charge of his son Dilīpa and retired to the forest to perform austerities. He tried to bring the river Gaṅgā to wash the ashes of his ancestors and redeem their souls, but he did not succeed. The task was achieved later by his grandson Bhagīratha.</p>

			<p>All those who labour need rest. The system of holidays and vacations is as old as mankind. The Vedic students and their teachers were no exception. Adhyayana or Vedic studies were to be pursued according to some rules and regulations set by tradition. On certain specified days, the ācārya would not teach. Such days were known as anadhyāya or days of anadhyayana. However, on such days the students were expected to revise their lessons, to do cintana and manana (reflection) and even get guidance from the senior students.</p>
			<p>Days of anadhyāya are: pratipad, aṣṭamī, caturdaśī, pūrṇimā and amāvāsyā as also days of saṅkramaṇa. These are—according to the lunar calendar—the 1st, 8th and 14th days after new-moon and full-moon; full-moon and new-moon days, and the days on which the sun enters the next sign of the zodiac.</p>

			<p>When a yogi practises prāṇā yāma (breathing exercises aimed at regulating the energy of prāṇa) and achieves purification of the nāḍīs (tubular structures through which prāṇic energy flows) he starts hearing melodious sounds of praṇava or Oṁkāra. Since these sounds are generated without any beating (āhati) of two objects (which, incidentally, is the usual way of producing sound) they are called &#x2018;anāhata-nāda.&#x2019; The sound is normally heard through the right ear whether open or closed. However, it is more distinct when the ears are kept closed.</p>
			<p>Some authorities say that the sound can also be heard if the ajapāmantra is repeated one lakh times.</p>

			<p>The Nyāya system of philosophy describes five kinds of &#x2018;hetvābhāsas&#x2019; or fallacies in logic, one of which is &#x2018;anaikāntika,&#x2019; also called &#x2018;savyabhicāra.&#x2019; This fallacy occurs when the ostensible middle-term violates the general rule of inference, namely, that it must be universally related to the major term or that the major term must be present in all cases in which the middle is present. For instance, consider the statement: &#x2018;All knowable objects are fiery. The hill is knowable. Therefore the hill is fiery.&#x2019; Here the middle term &#x2018;knowable&#x2019; is indifferently related to both fiery objects like the kitchen and fireless objects like the lake. All knowable objects being thus not fiery, we cannot argue that a hill is fiery because it is knowable.</p>

			<p>This term is generally used to indicate unadulterated perfect bliss, got by the realization of God or the Self. In fact, one of the three basic terms used to indicate the nature of God is ānanda, the other two being sat (existence) and cit (consciousness). The second chapter of the <em>Taittirīya Upaniṣad</em> designated as <em>Ānanda Vallī</em> shows by a calculation of its own, that brahmānanda or bliss of Brahman is infinitely superior to the greatest joy that a human being ideally situated in life can ever hope to get.</p>
			<p>The word is also used to indicate Lord Viṣṇu, a particular variety of Sanskrit metre and particular combinations of nakṣatras (stars) with weekdays, like Aśvinī being in conjunction with Sunday, and so on.</p>
			<p>The word is also used as a suffix in the names of saṁnyāsins (monks), though it is difficult to say since when exactly the practice began. Earlier saṁnyāsins like Śaṅkara have not used it. Later ācāryas (pontiffs) of the Śṛṅgerī Monastery (for instance, Śaṅkarānanda) have started using it.</p>

			<p>One of the well-known polemical writers of Advaita metaphysics, Ānanda-bodha (11th cent. A.D.) (also called Ānanda-bodhācārya and Ānandabodha Bhaṭṭārakā-cārya) a disciple of Vimuktātman of the <em>Iṣṭisiddhi</em> fame (10th cent. A. D.) has four works to his credit: <em>Nyāyamakaranda, Nyāyadīpāvalī, Pramāṇamālā</em> and <em>Śabda-nirṇaya Vyākhyā</em>. The first of these is the most celebrated and has been commented upon by Citsukha (13th cent. A. D.). The special features of this work are: refutation of the Sāṅkhyan theory of multiplicity of selves and the apparent difference of objective entities; the theory that everything other than Brahman is mithyā (false) since it is dṛśya (perceived); a new defini-tion of mithyātva (falsity) viz., <em>sadbhinnatvaṁ mithyātvam</em> (falsity is being diffe-rent from the real); that avidyā is positive in the sense it is non-negative; that the cessation of avidyā is an entity of a fifth category, different from sat (real), asat (unreal), sad-asat (real-unreal) and anirvacanīya (indefinable).</p>

			<p>Among all the Indian Philosophical systems, the Advaita Vedānta of Śaṅkara and his followers can boast of the maximum number of written works. One of the writers in this line who has done yeomen service by writing sub-commentaries on all the major works of Śaṅkara is Ānanda-jñāna, celebrated as Ānandagiri, who lived in the 14th cent. A. D. Known as Janārdana in his premonastic life, he was the son of one Sūryanārāyaṇa and belonged to the country called Cera (now in Tamil Nadu). He was probably a devotee of Viṣṇu. His guru was Śuddhānanda. His ṭīkā (comment) on the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Vārttika</em> of Sureśvara (7th—8th cent. A.D.) has been highly appreciated. In his original polemical work <em>Vedānta-tarka-saṅgraha</em> he has refuted the Vaiśeṣika categories like dravya, guṇa etc. In his conclusions he has tried to follow his predecessors like Ānandabodha (11th cent. A. D.) and others. He holds that avidyā or ajñāna which is an indeterminable false entity is the stuff of this world. Ajñāna is one only and is supported by Brahman.</p>

			<p>The <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Mahābhārata</em> are the two popular scriptures that have ruled the hearts of the Hindus for millennia. They have inspired innumerable writers, poets and artists to create marvellous works of literature and art based upon the themes drawn from their stories and personalities. One of the numerous Rāmāyaṇas that have sprung up in imita-tion of Vālmīki&#x2019;s is the <em>Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa</em>, sometimes styled as <em>Manohara-Ānanda-Rāmāyaṇa</em> also. Though attributed by tradition to Vālmīki himself, it is obviously a late work, later than the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> (14th cent. A.D.)</p>
			<p>The work comprises 12,323 verses spread over 109 sargas or chapters contained in nine kāṇḍas or books. It is written in the form of a dialogue between Pārvatī and Śiva, later on introducing another dialogue between two sages Rāmadāsa and his disciple Viṣṇudāsa. A few innovations and many additions have been made to the original story as given in Vālmīki&#x2019;s <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>Perhaps, the book was written at a time when the Kṛṣṇa cults were becoming more popular, to reassert the glory and supremacy of Rāma. Though attempts have been made to establish the identity of the two incarnations and to foresee the events of Kṛṣṇāvatāra in Rāma&#x2019;s story, the predisposition in favour of Rāma is obvious.</p>
			<p>An attempt can now be made to summarise the work briefly:</p>
			<p>The first book known as <em>Sārakāṇḍa</em> (13 sargas, 2565 ślokas or verses) summarises the entire story of Vālmīki&#x2019;s <em>Rāmāyaṇa,</em> including Rāvaṇa&#x2019;s story as given in the last book, <em>Uttarakāṇda</em>. The story of Rāvaṇa&#x2019;s bringing the ātmaliṅga of Śiva from Kailāsa and the liṅga being fixed to the ground at Gokarṇa due to the machinations of Viṣṇu in the guise of a brāhmaṇa boy appears in the 9th sarga. So also the story of establishment of the liṅga at Rāmeśvara. Other additions to the original are: the humbling of Māruti&#x2019;s pride, the slaying of Airāvaṇa and Mairāvaṇa (friends of Rāvaṇa from the nether world), the story of Kanyākumārī and the teaching of <em>Catuśśloki Bhāgavata</em> to Vyāsa by Nārada.</p>
			<p>The second book called <em>Yātrākāṇḍa</em> (9 sargas, 746 ślokas) deals with the worship of the river Gaṅgā by Sītā, the story of the river Sarayū and Rāma&#x2019;s pilgrimage.</p>
			<p>The third book designated <em>Yāga-kāṇḍa</em> (9 sargas, 628 ślokas) describes the Aśvamedhayāga performed by Rāma along with Sītā.</p>
			<p>The fourth book, the <em>Vilāsakāṇḍa</em> (9 sargas, 676 ślokas) describes the amorous sports of Rāma and Sītā.</p>
			<p>The fifth book named <em>Śubhajanma-kāṇḍa</em> or <em>Janmakāṇḍa</em> (9 sargas, 804 ślokas) deals with the story of the banish-ment of Sītā and the birth of Lava and Kuśa to Sītā. The interesting points to be noted are: Rāma deliberately plans and enacts the drama of banishment; Kuśa is the son born in the natural way to Sītā, whereas another baby created by Vālmīki out of &#x2018;lava&#x2019; seeds (cloves or nutmeg) (hence named &#x2018;Lava&#x2019;) and infused with life is accepted by Sītā as her own son and a special vrata (religious rite) called &#x2018;Saṁyogakaraṇavrata&#x2019; is performed by Sītā at the behest of Vālmīki. The famous <em>Rāmarakṣā Stotra</em> forms part of the 5th sarga.</p>
			<p>The sixth book christened <em>Vivāha-kāṇḍa</em> (9 sargas, 585 ślokas) describes the marriage of Kuśa with Campikā and Lava with Sumati, as also the marriage of Yūpaketu (son of Śatrughna) with Madanasundarī (daughter of the King Kambukaṇṭha). The last section deals with the mūlamantra of Āñjaneya and the process of repeating it in order to get rid of the maladies due to diseases and evil spirits.</p>
			<p><em>Rājyakāṇḍa</em> (24 sargas, 2641 ślokas), the seventh book, contains some miscellaneous topics like <em>Rāmasahasranāma</em>, the story of a dog and a saṁnyāsin who was given the &#x2018;punishment&#x2019; of being made the head of a temple organization, the banning of laughter in his kingdom by Rāma, the story of Vālmīki&#x2019;s previous births and Rāma teaching a lesson to Sītā and Rāma&#x2019;s discourses on dharma to his subjects. The 8th sarga of this book is completely in prose.</p>
			<p><em>Manoharakāṇḍa</em> (18 sargas, 3101 ślokas) the penultimate book is the largest in volume and contains Rāma&#x2019;s expounding spiritual truths to his mother Kausalyā as also Sumitrā and Kaikeyī, at their request. A number of hymns, technically called &#x2018;kavaca&#x2019; (= armour) have been included in this section (<em>Śrīrāmakavaca, Hanūmatkavaca, Sītākavaca</em> and so on). A ritual recitation of these is said to fulfil any desire one cherishes. The 17th sarga gives the story of <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> in a nutshell and is called <em>Sārarāmāyaṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>The last book, with the appellation of <em>Pūrṇakāṇḍa</em> (9 sargas, 577 ślokas) is the smallest in size. It describes Rāma&#x2019;s ascent to Vaikuṇṭha (the abode of Viṣṇu) as Viṣṇu after installing Kuśa on his throne as his successor.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Literally the word means &#x2018;that which is endless,&#x2019; hence &#x2018;infinite&#x2019;. It is one of the epithets frequently used to describe or praise God in the Hindu scriptures. The Upaniṣads hold that Brahman is satya, jñāna and ananta (truth, knowledge or consciousness and infinite).</p>
			<p>In the mythological lore, Ādiśeṣa the great serpent on whom Lord Viṣṇu is resting, is named &#x2018;Ananta.&#x2019; He is &#x2018;Ananta&#x2019; since he has an infinite number of hoods on which he is supporting the worlds. He represents cosmic time which is infinite and endless. Created worlds come into being in time and are sustained in time. This is the meaning of the hoods of Ananta supporting the worlds.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Vratas (religious vows) and utsavas (celebrations) have become an integral part of Hindu religious, cultural and social life. If vratas stress the need for personal religious vows and discipline, utsavas provide an opportunity for rejoicing with the other members of the community.</p>
			<p>One of several such vratas is Ananta-caturdaśī vrata, which is celebrated on the caturdaśī (14th day) of the bright fortnight of the month Bhādrapada (August-September). It consists chiefly in the worship of Lord Viṣṇu as Ananta (&#x2018;the Infinite One&#x2019;) and in the wearing of a holy strap of thread dyed with saffron, on the hand (on the right hand in the case of men and on the left in the case of women). The thread should be of cotton or silk and should have 14 knots. It should be worn after keeping it on a jar of water duly established on a maṇḍala (ritual diagram) and worshipping it. The <em>Agnipurāṇa</em> (192.9) gives the mantra to be recited on this occasion.</p>
			<p>It is an individual vrata which is normally performed on the bank of a river. Salt is forbidden in this vrata. Gaining happiness is the result promised. It is believed that if it is performed regularly for 14 years, one can reach the abode of Viṣṇu.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;One who is reclining on the serpent Ananta&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Lord Viṣṇu has several aspects of manifestation. The one depicting him as reclining on the coils of serpent Śeṣa or Ananta (as bed) is called &#x2018;Śeṣaśayana&#x2019; or &#x2018;Anantaśayana.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The śayana-images (images showing Viṣṇu, in the reclining posture) are of four types: yogaśayana, bhogaśayana, vīraśayana and ābhicārikaśayana. The first shows him with two arms and in a meditative mood, with half—closed eyes. Instead of Śrī and Bhū, the two consorts, the sages Bhṛgu and Mārkaṇḍeya are shown. Brahmā is shown seated on the lotus emerging from his navel. In the second type there are four arms and the icon is fully bedecked with ornaments. Śrī and Bhū are also shown along with the sages Bhṛgu and Mārkaṇḍeya. Brahmā and Śiva are shown on the rear wall. In the third type, he is holding śaṅkha (conch) and cakra (discus) in two of the four hands. The demons Madhu and Kaiṭabha are shown at his feet, trying to attack him. In the last type, he is shown with an emaciated body, scanty clothing and with no attendants. This image is usually set up outside the town or village.</p>
			<p>These four images are respectively worshipped by those seeking spiritual welfare, worldly enjoyments, strength and destruction of enemies.</p>
			<p>Trivandrum, capital city of Kerala state, was formerly known as Tiru-Ananta-puram or Anantaśayana since it has a reputed temple dedicated to Ananta-śayana, also called Padmanābha. It is one of the well-known shrines dedicated to Viṣṇu and was probably built during the early medieval era. The image is made of stucco and hence no abhiṣeka (ceremonial bathing) is done to it.</p>
			<p>The main difference between the Raṅganātha icon (which is also a śayana—image) and Anantaśayana is that the latter has Brahmā on the lotus rising from the navel whereas the former does not have it.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism are the three world religions which accept the theory of karma and reincarnation. According to this theory, the principle, &#x2018;As you sow, so you reap&#x2019; can be applied to the field of our actions, both physical and psychical.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Karma&#x2019; is the unseen effect of an action which will become manifest in course of time under favourable circumstances. This karma is of three types: sañcita (&#x2018;the accumulated&#x2019;) or anārabdha (&#x2018;not begun&#x2019;), ārabdha or prārabdha (&#x2018;the begun&#x2019;) and kriyamāṇa (&#x2018;being done now&#x2019;) or āgāmī (&#x2018;[giving fruit] in future&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>The entire mass of karma which has accumulated over several births, which is yet to fructify, is &#x2018;anārabdha.&#x2019; It is from this stock of karma, that a part gets ripened and causes the present birth.</p>
			<p>Hindu philosophical and religious works declare that ātmajñāna (self-realization) can destroy this mass of anārabdhakarma, thus preventing future transmigrations.</p>
			<p>The word is also used in its literal sense of anything that is not begun or undertaken.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The dominant trend of the Upaniṣads is towards karma-saṁnyāsa or karma-tyāga, renunication of all actions, since it was strongly believed that karma or action lead to spiritual bondage. Opposition to this view is first noticed in the <em>Īśāvāsya Upaniṣad</em> (2) which is later on developed in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> as a regular doctrine. It is āsakti or attachment to the fruits of actions that is really the cause of spiritual bondage. Hence, if actions can be performed with anāsakti or detachment, the sting or the binding taint, being thus taken away, the very same actions lead to purification of mind and spiritual enlightenment. This is &#x2018;anāsakti-yoga,&#x2019; yoga or union with God, through anāsakti or detachment. This theory thus strikes a balance between karma (activity) and saṁnyāsa (renunciation), between pravṛtti (activism) and nivṛtti (withdrawal). For details see <ref>KARMAYOGA</ref>.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the dharmaśāstras, the life of an individual is divided into four āśramas or stages of life viz., brahmacarya, gārhasthya, vānaprastha and saṁnyāsa signifying the states of a student, house-holder, forest-recluse and monk. It was obligatory for a householder belonging to the first three varṇas (castes) to maintain sacrificial fire and to offer oblations regularly. The wife also had a place in this ritual and could act as a substitute for her husband in times of need. No greater calamity could befall a householder than the untimely death of his wife. Her body would be cremated with the same fire in which she used to offer oblations. The widower had only two alternatives left: to enter into the next stage of the vānaprastha or to marry once again and set up the fire afresh. Anyone who did neither was branded as an &#x2018;anāśramin,&#x2019; one who was outside the pale of the āśrama scheme. This was incompa-tible with the Vedic scheme of life.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the most celebrated women of Hindu mythology, considered as a model of wifely virtues, Anasūyā was a daughter of Kardama and Devahūti. She was married to the great sage Atri whom she served with intense devotion and love. Once, when there was a severe famine, she saved people by producing vegetables and fruits through her power of tapas (austerity). She even made the river Gaṅgā which had dried up, flow again.</p>
			<p>The Trinity (Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva) subjected her to a severe test of her chastity from which she emerged successfully. As a reward they were born as her children: Viṣṇu as Dattātreya, Śiva as Durvāsas and Brahmā as Candra.</p>
			<p>When Rāma and Sītā visited Atri&#x2019;s hermitage in the daṇḍaka forest Anasūyā taught Sītā the value of devoted service to one&#x2019;s husband as the necessary and sufficient discipline for spiritual welfare.</p>

			<p>&#x2018;Who am I?&#x2019;, &#x2018;Whence did this world originate?&#x2019;—these are two of the important questions posed by philosophical inquirers. The Vedānta system of philosophy posits the view that the world has evolved out of the Ātman (the Self) and it is the same Ātman that is our real nature. Everything else is included under the term &#x2018;anātman&#x2019;. Though literally the external world with its myriads of objects is also anātman, the word is used more particularly to denote the body, the sense-organs and the mind which force us to identify ourselves with them, thereby forgetting our Ātman-nature.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Śaiva schools of philosophy including the Pāśupata, Pratyabhijñā and the Vīraśaiva, consider Śiva as the supreme Deity. He is the Pati (the Lord) whereas the jīvas (individual souls) are paśus (animals, the bound ones). Though the jīva is similar to Śiva, the Paśupati, he is not identical with Him. The difference is rather in quantity than in quality. It is pāśajāla (web of bonds) that makes him small, limited, bound, and forces him to transmigrate. The first of these pāśas—also known as malas or impurities—is avidyā or ignorance which makes him feel he is aṇu, small, finite and limited. Hence it is called &#x2018;āṇavamala.&#x2019; Due to this, the jīva, though he is pure consciousness, imagines himself finite, confined to the body and of limited knowledge and power.</p>
			<p>The other two are kārmamala and māyīyamala.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a technical term specially used in Hindu logic. When the cause and effect series becomes infinite and does not serve as a proof, it is called anavasthā (infinite regress) and hence rejected.</p>
			<p>This anavasthā is sometimes divided into two varieties: prāmāṇikī or valid, and aprāmāṇikī or invalid. For instance, in the series of bīja (seed) and vṛkṣa (tree) the infinite regress is valid and natural. Hence it is prāmāṇikī. On the other hand, while trying to prove the existence of a cause for this world, if that cause (called Brahman) is accepted to have been caused by something else, it leads to anavasthā, infinite regress, and hence to no definite conclusion. This anavasthā is aprāmāṇikī or invalid. (To avoid this, Vedānta accepts Brahman as the uncaused cause.)</p>

			<p>Patañjali, in his famous work, the <em>Yogasūtras</em> (1.30), describes nine anta-rāyas or obstacles to the attainment of yoga. Anavasthitatva is the last in the list and also the most formidable one to overcome. With assiduous practice, a yogi can succeed in raising his mind to certain higher states but very soon it slides back to lower ones or reverts into the old rut. Deep-rooted evil tendencies like inordinate lust and love of lucre or mercurial irri-tability or crass selfishness are often responsible for this fall. By dispassionate and deep introspection, consultation with the guru and prayer to God, one can discover the root-cause and eliminate it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Monasteries known as maṭhas as also their pontiffs, the maṭhādhipatis, have played an important role in preserving Hindu religion and culture. Tapas (austerity) and vidyā (learning) have been the bedrock of their spiritual activities.</p>
			<p>One of the maṭhas of recent origin and perhaps less known than its counterparts is the Āṇḍavan Maṭha of Śrīraṅgam (Tamil Nadu). The Maṭha belonging to the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition and following the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of Vedānta, originated with Śrīmad Gopālācārya Mahādeśikan, also called Tirukkuḍandai Deśikar, during the middle of the eighteenth century, in Kumbhakoṇam (of Tamil Nadu). He was a man who practised severe austerities and was known for his great scholastic learning. His three disciples, continued the tradition of this great savant without break. Śrīnivāsa Mahādeśikan (also known as Periyāṇdavan), the second of them, was as much a yogi of great powers as he was a monk of austerity and learning. The present pontiff, Śrī Vedānta Rāmānuja Mahādeśikan (Tirukkuḍandai Āṇdavan) the eighth in the order of succession, who was ordained in 1963 has been working hard to spread the message of his predecessors.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the Sāṅkhyadarśana, one of the more well-known systems of Hindu philosophy, there are two types of creation: the elemental creation and creation of buddhi. The latter, called pratyaya-sarga, is fourfold: viparyaya (ignorance), aśakti (incapacity), tuṣṭi (contentment) and siddhi (perfection or powers). Andhatā-misra is a subdivision of viparyaya and is manifested as fear of death or self-destruction. Eighteen varieties of this are mentioned. There are five gross objects of pleasure enjoyed through the five organs of perception (e.g., śabda or sound by śrotra or ear etc.) and five subtle objects, their counterparts, enjoyed in higher worlds like heaven. There are also eight siddhis or powers like aṇimā (capacity to become atomic in size) and so on. The fear that these siddhis may be lost is andhatāmisra.</p>
			<p>In the Yoga system of Patañjali this is called abhiniveśa (excessive attachment or clinging to life).</p>
			<p>The words tāmisra and andhatāmisra have also been used in the purāṇas to indicate certain hells into which people committing certain types of heinous crimes and sins (like suicide, usurping the wealth and women of other people) are cast.</p>

			<p>Earliest reference to the Āndhras is in the <em>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</em> (33.6) where they are mentioned as one of the low-caste groups along with Pulindas, Puṇḍras and Mūtibas. These castes were created by the fifty sons of Viśvāmitra as a result of his curse. The Āndhras were outcastes subsisting on wild animals.</p>
			<p>However, Āndhra as a country and as a people has found mention in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata</em> and some of the purāṇas. The country referred to was that between the rivers Godāvarī and Kṛṣṇā.</p>
			<p>The Āndhra country was part of Aśoka&#x2019;s empire. The political history of an independent Āndhra starts with the Śātavāhanas (280 B. C.—A. D. 218). The Kākatīyas (11th to 14th cent. A. D.) were another important dynasty which contri-buted to the cultural development of the Āndhra. However it was under the Vijaya-nagar kings (A. D. 1336—1556) that specta-cular progress was achieved.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;theory of several assertions&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Jaina logic and metaphysics have developed a theory technically called &#x2018;anekāntavāda,&#x2019; &#x2018;syādvāda&#x2019; or &#x2018;sapta-bhaṅgīnaya&#x2019; according to which seven assertions are possible with regard to everything. Though these assertions are seemingly contradictory, they are possible. The theory derives its name from the fact that &#x2018;ekānta&#x2019; or one absolute assertion cannot be (&#x2018;na&#x2019;) made about anything (na + ekānta = anekānta). Since the possible statements contain the word &#x2018;syād&#x2019; (&#x2018;may be so&#x2019;), it is called &#x2018;syādvāda.&#x2019; Since the number of such alternatives or possibilities is seven it is also called &#x2018;saptabhaṅgīnaya&#x2019; (sapta = seven, bhaṅgī = mode, naya = standpoint; seven modes of expression from different standpoints).</p>
			<p>We can now state the theory as follows: The object, like a ghaṭa or jar</p>
			<ol>
				<li>is (asti);</li>
				<li>is not, (nāsti);</li>
				<li>is and is not (asti, nāsti);</li>
				<li>is unpredicable (avaktavya);</li>
				<li>is and is unpredicable (asti, avaktavya);</li>
				<li>is not and is unpredicable (nāsti, avaktavya);</li>
				<li>is, is not and is unpredicable (asti, nāsti, avaktavya).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The word &#x2018;syād&#x2019; (&#x2018;may be&#x2019;) indicating the possibility is added everywhere (e.g., syād asti, syān nāsti and so on).</p>
			<p>The word āsti&#x2019; ( = is) when used with regard to any object affirms its existence from the standpoint of its (sva) rūpa (form), dravya (material), kṣetra (place) and kāla (time). Similarly the word &#x2018;nāsti&#x2019; (= is not) denies that existence from the standpoint of another (para) form, material, place or time. When these two are taken together, it becomes &#x2018;avaktavya,&#x2019; unspeakable or unpredicable. For instance, the jar in front of us in this room exists as jar here and now and does not exist as a cloth or elsewhere or at a different time.</p>
			<p>The seven possible assertions are obtained by a permutation and combination of the statements (1) to (4).</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;part,&#x2019; &#x2018;limb&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word which literally means part or a limb, is often used in a technical sense. For instance, in medical sciences it stands for the body or its limb. In Jainism, it stands for a class of scriptures which are twelve in number.</p>
			<p>In Vedic sacrifices the word aṅga indicates a subordinate rite. For instance, Paśubandha is an aṅga of Somayāga; or Prayāja is an aṅga of Darśa. These subsidiary rites may or may not produce any separate result.</p>
			<p>More often the word is used in combination with other words getting a technical flavour. Here are some samples: pañcāṅga, the five parts of an almanac like nakṣatra or star; rājyāṅgas, the seven components of an imperial set-up like the king; senāṅgas, the four parts of an armed force like infantry; Vedāṅgas, the six subsidiary branches of knowledge which help the study of the Vedas, like Śikṣā or the science of articulation; yajñāṅgas, the vessels used in a sacrifices like sruk and sruva (spoon and ladle) and yogāṅgas, the eight steps of yoga like yama or restraint and so on.</p>
			<p>Aṅga has often been mentioned as a country, now identified with eastern Bihar or the region around Bhagalpur in Bihar. Śiva is said to have burnt Manmatha (Cupid) to ashes here. Since Manmatha was ultimately revived, getting back his aṅgas or limbs, the place came to be known as Aṅga or Aṅgadeśa. This was once ruled by the well-known king Roma-pāda. During his regime there was once a severe famine. When the sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga was tactfully brought into the kingdom, it rained heavily and the people were saved from starvation.</p>
			<p>The <em>Arthaśāstra</em> of Kauṭilya (2.2) mentions that Aṅga is famous for well-bred elephants.</p>
			<p>In the mythological lore, several kings by name Aṅga are mentioned: a king who had joined Duryodhana in the Kurukṣetra war; a kṣattriya hero who fought the great king Māndhātṛ; a kṣattriya king, the eldest son of Bali and Sudeṣṇā.</p>
			<p>Karṇa, of the Mahābhārata fame, was the king of Aṅgadeśa.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>In Vīraśaivism (one of the important schools of Śaivism) Brahman is called &#x2018;Sthala&#x2019;. &#x2018;Stha&#x2019; stands for &#x2018;sthāna&#x2019; (place) and &#x2018;la&#x2019; for &#x2018;laya&#x2019; (dissolution). So &#x2018;Sthala&#x2019; is that place or source from which the universe evolves and into which it dissolves ultimately. This &#x2018;Sthala&#x2019; divides itself out of līlā or play into liṅga and aṅga, also called liṅgasthala and aṅgasthala. Aṅga is the individual soul or jīva (so called because he goes back [ga] to Brahman [aṁ] ) and liṅga (= that into which everything gets dissolved, līyate) is God, Śiva. Aṅga becomes one with liṅga in course of time as a result of bhakti, upāsanā or worship. See <ref>ṢAṬSTHALA-SIDDHĀNTA</ref> for details.</p>

			<word>Aṅgad, Guru</word>
			<note>(A. D. 1504—1552)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Sikhism, the youngest of world reli-gions, was started by Guru Nānak (A. D. 1469—1539). It was nurtured, developed and stabilized by a succession of Gurus up to Guru Gobind Singh (A. D. 1666—1708) who declared that the sacred book, the <em>Granth</em>, respectfully called <em>Guru Granth Sāhib</em> would take the place of the Guru thereafter.</p>
			<p>Guru Aṅgad was the immediate successor of Guru Nānak, chosen and anointed by Nānak himself. Before ordination his name was Lehna. Lehna who was the son of a trader called Pheru and lived in Khadur in the Punjab was a devotee of Mother Durgā. He used to lead pilgrims to the Durgā temple and the Jvālāmukhi (a volcanic vent nearby). By chance, he once heard the recital of the famous Sikh prayer Japji and diligently sought after its author. When he finally met the Guru Nānak his joy knew no bounds.</p>
			<p>Then began his long tenure of single-minded and devoted service to his guru. During the period of internship and training he endured all the tests, trials and tribulations and earned Guru Nānak&#x2019;s confidence and faith in the fullest measure. Much against the opposition of his own wife and two sons, Guru Nānak chose Lehna—now called Aṅgad—as his successor and anointed him as the next Guru in A. D. 1539.</p>
			<p>Aṅgad, though eminently fitted for the Guru&#x2019;s place, had to contend with the powerful rivalry of Siri Chand, Guru Nānak&#x2019;s eldest son, who had started the Udāsī sect, a sect with Sikh principles and an ascetic character. In course of time this sect got merged in the general body of the Sikhs, mainly due to Guru Aṅgad&#x2019;s efforts.</p>
			<p>Another challenge he had to face was from the orthodox Hinduism. To keep up a distinct character for the Sikhs and Sikhism, he improved upon the Gurumukhi script and committed the hymns of Guru Nānak to writing, in that script, making it available to the common folk who got a scripture of their own, in their own language.</p>
			<p>Aṅgad further strengthened the two institutions of laṅgar (free kitchen) and saṅgat (regular religious meetings in groups) established earlier by Nānak.</p>
			<p>Vigorous preaching of Nānak&#x2019;s doctrines, simple life in conformity with those doctrines, building a new town called Goindwal and introduction of physical culture as part of life and religion were his other contributions.</p>
			<p>Guru Aṅgad breathed his last in 1552 at the age of forty-eight.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A well-known hero of <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, Aṅgada was the son of Vālī and Tārā. His exploits are many and varied. When Sugrīva was anointed as the king of Kiṣkindhā, Aṅgada was appointed as the yuvarāja, the heir apparent. He was the leader of the group of monkeys that was sent to the south in search of Sītā. Before the commencement of the war, Śrī Rāma had sent him to Rāvaṇa on a peace mission. Later, when the war was in progress he succeeded in disturbing the sacrifice at Nikumbhilā performed by Indrajit. He killed many rākṣasa heroes of Rāvaṇa&#x2019;s army during the battles.</p>
			<p>There are two more Aṅgadas mentioned in the itihāsas: Aṅgada, the first son of Lakṣmaṇa and Ūrmilā; Aṅgada, a kṣattriya king, who fought for Duryodhana in the Kurukṣetra war.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;shaking of limbs&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Patañjali, the great master of the yoga system, recognizes that the principle &#x2018;prevention is better than cure&#x2019; can be and should be applied in the path of yoga also. To facilitate its practice, he has listed nine &#x2018;antarāyas&#x2019; or obstacles to yoga (<em>Yoga-sūtras</em> 1.30) and has added another five in a supplementary list (ibid. 1.31). He calls these as &#x2018;vikṣepasahabhuvaḥ&#x2019; (co-existing with mental distractions). Aṅgamejayatva is the third obstacle in this list.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Aṅga&#x2019; means limb and &#x2018;ejana&#x2019; means shaking. So aṅgamejayatva is shaking or restless movement of limbs. When sorrow, disappointment and despair are not sublimated by discrimination and will-power, they cause tremendous restlessness in the mind. This affects the nervous system, getting reflected in physical restlessness. The aspirant is thus unable to sit steadily on the seat and frequently changes his position. Persisting in the practice of yoga, repetition of praṇava (Oṁ) and an attitude of surrender to God will gradually lessen this disturbance.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu ritualistic worship has evolved into a well-developed science. Before starting the worship of the deity, all articles used in the process are to be purified, not only physically but also ceremonially. Nyāsa is such an act in this process, and means the &#x2018;placing&#x2019; of gods or holy words or letters on certain parts of the body. Aṅganyāsa is an aspect of this nyāsa. Also called &#x2018;Ṣaḍaṅganyāsa&#x2019; (ṣaṭ = six, aṅga = limb), it involves the ceremonial purification and protection of hṛdaya (heart), śiras (head), śikhā (tuft), kavaca (armour, indicated by touching the shoulders with the hands crossed), netratraya (three eyes, including the middle of the eyebrows) and karatala (palm of the hand). The process is sometimes extended to more parts of the body like the feet, navel and so on.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>From the ancient times, the throbbing of the limbs, particularly of the arm and the eye, has been regarded as the harbinger of coming events, auspicious or otherwise. For men, throbbing of the right side of the body is considered an auspicious sign. For women, the opposite holds good.</p>
			<p>Some examples of such prognosti-cations can be given: The fruit indicated by the throbbing of the top of the head is the acquisition of land; of the forehead, the prosperity of the position already occupied; of the region of the eye, death; of the upper arm, union with friends; of the hand, acquisition of wealth; of the back, defeat and so on.</p>
			<p>The <em>Matsyapurāṇa</em> (ch. 241) advises the placating of brāhmaṇas with gifts of gold to ward off the evil effects of such throbbing.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that the well-known astrological work <em>Bṛhatsaṁhitā </em>of Varāhamihira (6th cent. A. D.) treats of this subject (in chapter 51) in an entirely different way. When an enquirer wishes to know from the astrologer any information (for instance, about the thief who has stolen his articles), the astrologer has to closely observe the way the enquirer puts the questions touching any of his aṅgas or limbs in the process in a natural way, and prognosticate the results. For instance, if the enquirer touches his own feet in the process, the astrologer can conclude that the servant is the thief. Of course, time and place of questioning also count.</p>

			<word>Aṅgiras</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the sages we come across, not infrequently, in the Hindu religious literature, is Aṅgiras. A number of Vedic hymns are attributed to him. Associated with the fire cult, he is regarded as the first sacrificer and initiator of sacred ritual. In fact, he is said to have discharged the duties of Agni (the fire-god) once when the latter had absconded, and thus saved the world. The mythological works describe him sometimes as a mānasaputra (mind-born son) of Brahmā, the Creator and sometimes as having sprung from the sacrificial fire of god Varuṇa. Vasudhā, Śraddhā, Svadhā and Satī were his wives. Bṛhaspati was one of his sons. The pitṛ-devatās (manes) are also described as his offsprings. The well-known lunar deities Rākā, Sinīvālī and Kuhū (which are actually phases of the moon) are consi-dered as his daughters.</p>
			<p>Extolled for his great virtues, Aṅgiras was also a teacher of Brahmavidyā, know-ledge of Brahman (the Absolute). This explains his constant association with light, fire and luminous objects, including his identification with the planet Jupiter and a star in the constellation Ursa Major.</p>
			<p>He is listed among the Saptarṣis (the seven sages) of the first Manvantara (the period or age of Manu). He is one of the originators of the gotra system. The Āṅgirases, descendants of Aṅgiras are stated to be kṣattriyas by birth and brāhmaṇas by profession. They were highly skilled in sacerdotal law, magic and traditional rites.</p>
			<p>He is credited with the authorship of a treatise on law (<em>Āṅgirasa Smṛti</em>) as also on astronomy.</p>

			<p>Smṛtis are law-books which prescribe the code of conduct for the individual and the society. Out of the several smṛtis known to us, <em>Āṅgirasa Smṛti</em> is one of the shorter works, but quoted even by authorities like Yājñavalkya.</p>
			<p>A perusal of the printed texts as also the several manuscripts available now, shows that the verses vary from 32 to 151! The book deals mainly with prāyaścitta or expiation for various forbidden acts like accepting food and drink from antyajas (people of lowest castes), for injuring cows as also for deadly sins. Its views on satī or sahagamana (wife dying on the funeral pyre of her dead husband) have been criticised by other works.</p>

			<word>Angkor Vat</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>It is now a well-known fact that Hindu culture had spread to countries far beyond the frontiers of the present day India. One such country is Cambodia, now known as Kampuchea (&#x2018;Kamboja&#x2019; in Sanskrit) in South East Asia. The kingdom of &#x2018;Kamboja&#x2019; is said to have been established by one Kambu-Svāyambhuva who had migrated from India; or by a brāhmaṇa, Kauṇḍinya by name, a &#x2018;disciple&#x2019; of &#x2018;Aśvatthāman.&#x2019; It had attained stability even by the 2nd-3rd century A. D.</p>
			<p>Of the several vestiges of Hindu culture there, Hindu temples are the best. The Angkor Vat is the biggest of such temples discovered in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was built by Sūryavarman II (A.D. 1112-1152), near his capital Angkor Thom.</p>
			<p>The Angkor Vat is a Vaiṣṇava temple of huge proportions built in the Draviḍian style. The temple area is rectangular in shape, surrounded by a moat 195 metres (650 ft.) wide and 3.8 kms. (2 1/2 miles) long. The side of the stone-flagged platform is nearly 900 metres (3000 ft.) in length. The temple walls contain carvings from the Hindu mythology, mostly from the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Bhāgavata</em>. The sculpture shows the effect of the Khmer culture also, original to the land.</p>

			<p>In iconography, images are recommended to be prepared according to the &#x2018;tālamāna&#x2019; system. A &#x2018;tāla&#x2019; is the measurement of the palm of hand (from the tip of the middle finger to the wrist) and is equal to the length of the face.

			<p>Acquisition of and mastery over super-human powers have always fascinated human beings. The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali, that matchless basic work on the science of yoga, calls such powers &#x2018;siddhis.&#x2019; Apart from other methods of obtaining such siddhis as auṣadhi (drugs) or tapas (austerity), the basic method is to practise the eight steps of yoga leading to samādhi (trance). When the pañca-bhūtas (the five elements like earth, water etc.) are chosen as the objects of meditation and samādhi is obtained on them in the prescribed way (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 3.44) it leads to the acquisition of the eight supernatural powers called aṣṭasiddhis (ibid. 3.45). Aṇimā is the first of these siddhis. As the very name suggests, it is the power to become minute like an &#x2018;aṇu&#x2019; or atom in size. Hanumān is said to have possessed this power.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Sacrificing an animal to please a supernatural deity is a common feature found in many cultures, including that of Hinduism, during the early part of their development. Though formal animal sacri-fices of the early Vedic period gradually lost their importance, due to the reformatory movements of the Upaniṣadic sages, Jainism and Buddhism, a new type of animal sacrifice got into the fabric of Hinduism during later ages, as aboriginal cultures got integrated into the Hindu fold.</p>
			<p>The deity was invariably an aspect of Durgā or Kālī and the rituals were very simple. Buffaloes, goats, sheep and cockerels were the usual sacrificial victims. It was believed that these victims would go to heaven.</p>
			<p>Various reform movements have helped to minimise this practice.</p>

			<p>A sage by name Māṇḍavya was once falsely accused of stealing and was put to death on a spear by the king. But, since he was innocent and had accumulated extraordinary powers by austerities, he did not die. When this was noticed, the king was frightened and got him released. He broke the spear but its &#x2018;aṇi&#x2019; or point was firmly imbedded in the sage&#x2019;s body. Hence he came to be known as Aṇimāṇḍavya.</p>
			<p>Since he had once killed flies as a child, he was taken to the world of Yama after death. But he protested saying that the sin committed by children below four-teen years belongs to their parents. For his mistake of forcing the sage to go to his world, Yama was cursed to be born in the human world. He was born as Vidura.</p>

			<p>Building a temple is considered a pious act. Since the temple is a house of God, the construction must be done not only meticulously but also religiously. One of the important religious ceremonies connected with the various stages of construction is &#x2018;aṅkurārpaṇa,&#x2019; the rite of offering the germinated seeds. It is performed before the construction begins, before laying the last brick or stone (mūrdheṣṭakā) into the superstructure, prior to the installation of the main image, before the opening of the eyes of the image (akṣimocana) and so on.</p>
			<p>The rite itself consists of placing the germinated seeds of different varieties of paddy, sesamum, mustard etc., in 16 copper vessels and placing them in front of Soma (the deity presiding over the process of germination).</p>
			<p>The main purpose of the rite is to facilitate the fruition of the work without obstacles.</p>

			<p>In the Dīpāvali festival which falls during the months of Āśvina and Kārttika (usually in November), on the third day known as Balipratipad, it is customary to worship the Govardhana hill which is near Mathurā (Uttar Pradesh). This is the legendary hill which Śrī Kṛṣṇa as a boy is said to have lifted up on his left little finger to protect the people and cattle of Vṛndāvana from the wrath of Indra who had sent incessant and heavy rains. Those who are not living near this hill are advised to make an image of the hill with cowdung or food. In the latter case, the heap of food (anna = food) is called annakūṭa and worship is offered to it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Saints and mystics who have propagated the cult of devotion to God have played a significant role in the Hindu society. Practically, there is no area or province or section of the Hindu world which does not exult in a saint of its own. The province of Āndhra (present Andhra Pradesh) is one such.</p>
			<p>Aṇṇamācārya (A. D. 1424—1503) of Tāḷḷapākam village in the Cuddapah district of Andhra Pradesh is one such saint who was not only a great scholar in Sanskrit and Telugu languages but also an inspired composer of devotional poetry. Born to Nārāyaṇa Sūri and Lakṣmamma in an orthodox brāhmaṇa family, he settled down at Tirupati, a renowned place of pilgrimage, even in early youth. Having taken initiation in the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition from one Viṣṇusvāmin he then studied Vedānta under the then pontiff of the Ahobila Maṭha, Śrī Śaṭhagopa Yatīndra. He also gained mastery over the Tamil <em>Prabandhams</em>. He had great devotion to Lord Veṅkaṭeśvara, the presiding deity of Tirupati. It is said that he used to sing everyday in the early morning before the deity. Even on the last day of his life he did so and then got merged in Him.</p>
			<p>According to some popular lores, Purandara Dāsa (A. D. 1484-1564), the musician-saint of Karnataka, is said to have met him at Tirupati and got inspiration from him to compose songs in the vernacular as exercises in music lessons.</p>
			<p>Aṇṇamācārya&#x2019;s compositions had been inscribed on copper plates and preserved in the temple of Veṅkaṭeśvara for posterity.</p>
			<p>Among his works in Sanskrit are <em>Veṅkaṭācala-māhātmyam</em> and <em>Saṅkīrtana-lakṣaṇam</em>. The Telugu works include <em>Dvipada-Rāmāyaṇa, Śṛṅgāramañjarī</em> and <em>Veṅkaṭeśa-śataka</em>, apart from about 12,000 kīrtanas or songs.</p>

			<p>It is the physical body born out of anna or food and nourished by food. Like a kośa or sheath, it covers the self and prevents the experience of its true nature. It is the first of the five such kośas (pañcakośas). It is destroyed at death. It is also called sthūla-śarīra or the gross body, the first of a series of three śarīras.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Hindu religious works known as dharmaśāstras consider the life of every Hindu as a religious process. It begins at conception and ends at cremation. The individual&#x2019;s life is to be purified, refined and sanctified continually by certain reli-gious processes called &#x2018;saṁskāras,&#x2019; usually translated as &#x2018;sacraments.&#x2019; They are sixteen in number. Hence the appellation &#x2018;Ṣoḍaśa-saṁskāras.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Annaprāśana is the seventh in the list. It is the first feeding of the child with solid food, starting the process of weaning the child away from breast-feeding. It can be performed any time after the sixth month and before the child completes one year.</p>
			<p>The father prepares a food of goat&#x2019;s flesh or flesh of partridge or of fish or boiled rice depending upon the result he expects for the child, like nourishment or holy lustre and so on. One of these is mixed with curds, honey and ghee and the child is made to taste it with the reciting of certain Vedic hymns. Then the father offers oblations to the fire. The mother is to eat the remainder of the food. Homa may also be performed and feeding of the brāhmaṇas may be arranged.</p>
			<p>According to some writers, on the day of this ceremony, tools and implements, vessels and weapons are to be spread in front of the gods worshipped in the house and the child allowed to crawl among them. The first object seized by the child is said to indicate its future profession.</p>

		<description>
			<p>If God is the creator of this universe, his power with which he creates, is pictured as a female deity, his consort, usually called Śakti. Most of the female deities or goddesses of the Hindu pantheon are aspects of Pārvatī, the consort of Śiva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity, responsible for destruction and dissolution of the universe.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Annapūrṇā, the possessor and giver of food, is one of the important aspects of Pārvatī. She got this name since she served anna or food to Lord Śiva himself when he was roaming about as a mendicant. She is shown as serving food from a vessel of ruby.</p>
			<p>Iconographically, she may be shown with four hands also, two hands holding pāśa (noose) and paraśu (battle-axe) and the other two showing the varada (boon-giving) and abhaya (protection from fear) mudrās.</p>
			<p>Her worship ensures that the household will never lack food. Her festival is usually observed in Caitra (April), mostly in Bengal.</p>
			<p>Her temple at Kāśī (Vārāṇasī, modern Banaras in Uttar Pradesh) is very famous.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This Upaniṣad belongs to the <em>Atharvaveda</em>. It is a fairly long work of 337 verses spread over five chapters.</p>
			<p>A yogi, Nidāgha by name, approaches Ṛbhu, the &#x2018;best among knowers of Brahman,&#x2019; for Self-knowledge. Ṛbhu prefaces his teaching by narrating how his father had taught him the &#x2018;best of mantras,&#x2019; &#x2018;the mantra of Annapūrṇā&#x2019; of 27 letters (<em>aim hrīṁ sauṁ śrīṁ klīm oṁ namo bhagavatyannapūrṇe mamābhilaṣitam annaṁ dehi svāhā</em>), how he had pleased the Divine Mother Annapūrṇā by repeating it day after day for a long time, how he had asked for ātmajñāna or Self-know-ledge from her when she appeared before him, and how he had got it by her grace. The name of the Upaniṣad is derived from this legend.</p>
			<p>The rest of the Upaniṣad is just a long and loose discourse on Advaita philosophy in which many of its aspects have been brought in, though not in a systematic manner.</p>
			<p>Apart from the topic of &#x2018;bhrama&#x2019; (delusion) and how to overcome it, the Upaniṣad also deals with topics like vāsanākṣaya (destruction of tendencies carried over from the previous lives), manonāśa (dissolution of the mind through yogic exercises) and a detailed description of the jīvanmukta (&#x2018;the liberated in life&#x2019;) who never gets affected by the various vicissitudes of life.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Anna or food, which is responsible for sustenance, has always been looked upon with reverence in Hinduism. Offering of consecrated food to the sacrificial fire is a common part of some rituals. It is especially so in the śrāddha (obsequies) ceremonies. In one such śrāddha, called pārvaṇa—śrāddha, after first consecrating the cooked food meant for oblation into the fire, the rest of the food in the vessel is also purified by the recitation of the <em>Annasūkta</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Annasūkta</em> is a series of eleven verses taken from the <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> (1.187.1-11). The ṛṣi (the sage to whom it is revealed) is Agastya. The devatā (deity to which it is addressed) is Annastuti. The chandas or meter is mostly Anuṣṭubh.</p>
			<p>According to the sage Śaunaka (<em>vide Ṛgvidhāna</em> 1-27) this sūkta must be chanted daily at the time of food. Such chanting purifies the food, destroying whatever impurities may be there, and ensures health and energy.</p>
			<p>The first verse is introductory. The second verse supplicates food for protection. The third requests food to be palatable. The next three are verses of praise. The seventh verse requests food to be available in plenty when it rains. The next three verses urge the body to grow strong as a result of consuming food. The last verse is a praise to food in the form of Soma.</p>

			<p>The words ṛta, satya and anṛta are frequently used in the Vedic literature, the first two being often used synonymously. If ṛta stands for &#x2018;what is straight,&#x2019; the Truth at its fundamental causal level, for the thing—in—itself, satya stands for the verbal expression of the same. Anṛta which may mean the opposite of ṛta or simply what is not ṛta is used mostly to indicate untruth, commonly called asatya. Speaking anṛta has always been considered as a great sin.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The general name by which mind is known in the Hindu scriptural works is &#x2018;antaḥkaraṇa,&#x2019; the &#x2018;inner (antaḥ) instrument (karaṇa).&#x2019; Even though the external sense-organs like the eye or the ear are functioning, no cognition becomes possible unless the mind is connected with them. Hence the significance of the name.</p>
			<p>Among the three states of consciousness viz., jāgrat (waking state), svapna (dream state) and suṣupti (deep sleep state), the antaḥkaraṇa is actively functioning in the first two and dormant in the third.</p>
			<p>This antaḥkaraṇa functions in four different ways and gets four different names according to the functions. While functioning as the receptive and retentive faculty it is called &#x2018;citta&#x2019; or mind-stuff; as the questioning, doubting and willing faculty, it is called &#x2018;manas&#x2019; or mind; as the deciding faculty it is called &#x2018;buddhi&#x2019; or intelligence; and as the identifying faculty which identifies itself with each of these functions it is called &#x2018;ahaṅkāra&#x2019; or the ego.</p>
			<p>These words are sometimes used to mean the antaḥkaraṇa or mind as a whole and sometimes to mean the particular faculty indicated. The sense in which they are used has to be made out from the context.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Temples or houses of God, have been in existence since a long time. The earliest of the Hindu temples as we see them today might have been built during the third or fourth centuries A. D. The most important part of the Hindu temple is the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em> known as garbhagṛha, the &#x2018;womb House,&#x2019; housing the image of the deity. Antarāla is the narrow passage that connects this garbhagṛha to the large hall or pavilion, called maṇṭapa which is normally used for congregational religious acts. This antarāla is also called ardha-maṇṭapa or śukanāsī.</p>
			<p>In temple symbology, the antarāla represents the neck of the deity, if the whole temple complex represents the body of the deity.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Yoga or union (yuj = to yoke) of the individual self with the Supreme Self can be attained through yoga or perfect concen-tration (yuj = to get samādhi or superconscious state). All attempts at controlling the vagaries of the mind—which is constantly rising in the form of vṛttis or wave-like modifications—are foiled by antarāyas or &#x2018;intruders&#x2019; which are actually obstacles in the path of yoga.</p>
			<p>Patañjali lists them as nine in number (<em>Yogasūtras</em> 1.30):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>vyādhi or illness;</li>
				<li>styāna or languor of the mind;</li>
				<li>saṁśaya or doubt;</li>
				<li>pramāda or heedlessness;</li>
				<li>ālasya or laziness of the body;</li>
				<li>avirati or absence of dispassion;</li>
				<li>bhrānti-darśana or false perception and hallucination;</li>
				<li>alabdhabhūmikatva or non-attainment of yogic states, and</li>
				<li>anavasthitatva or instability of a yogic state, when obtained.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is a second set of such antarāyas (ibid. 1.31) which &#x2018;coexist with mental distractions&#x2019; and are hence called &#x2018;vikṣepa-sahabhuvaḥ.&#x2019; They are five:</p> 
			<ol>
				<li>duḥkha or sorrow;</li>
				<li>daurmanasya or disappointment;</li>
				<li>aṅgamejayatva or restlessness of limbs;</li> 
				<li>śvāsa or forcible inhalation, and</li>
				<li>praśvāsa or forcible exhalation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All these disturb the mind and hence prove to be obstacles to the attainment of yoga.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Patañjali, the great teacher of Yoga, has described in his <em>Yogasūtras</em> several siddhis or miraculous powers, which a yogi can obtain through saṁyama. The practice of dhāraṇā (fixing the mind on the object of meditation) and dhyāna (continuous flow of the mind—stuff towards it) ending in samādhi (superconscious experience) is called saṁyama.</p>
			<p>When the yogi practises saṁyama upon the inherent capacity of his own body to be seen by others, thus controlling it, and by arresting its function, he becomes invisible to others. This siddhi is called antardhānatva. See <em>Yogasūtras</em> 3.21.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The science of Haṭhayoga prescribes &#x2018;dhauti&#x2019; or cleansing of the body to make it pure, healthy and strong so that it can withstand the rigours of Rājayoga. This is one of the several techniques and is of four kinds: antardhauti, dantadhauti, hṛd-dhauti and mūlaśodhana.</p>
			<p>Antardhauti, the first of these, is again of four kinds: vātasāra, vārisāra, vahnisāra or agnisāra and bahiṣkṛti.</p>
			<p>In vātasāra, the purification is effec-ted by inhaling air (vāta = air) by shaping the lips like the beak of a crow, filling up the stomach with it and expelling it through eructation.</p>
			<p>In vārisāra, warm saline water (vāri = water) is drunk and expelled through the rectum. This is later on followed by vamana-dhauti, drinking saline water and vomitting it.</p>
			<p>In vahnisāra, navel knot is pressed against the spinal cord by exhalation and contraction of the muscles of the stomach.</p>
			<p>Bahiṣkṛti is similar to vātasāra except that the air is expelled through the rectum instead of through the mouth.</p>
			<p>These techniques not only purify the body but also free it from diseases. However, they should be practised only under the personal guidance of an expert haṭhayogi.</p>

Sometimes a few more deities are assigned to this region: Apām Napāt, Aja-ekapāt, Rudra, Maruts, Parjanya and Āpaḥ (waters).</p>

			<word>Antaryāmi Brāhmaṇa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> which forms an important part of the <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> of the <em>Śukla Yajurveda</em> is by far the biggest of the extant Upaniṣads. The <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> is found to be in two śākhās or recensions, the <em>Kāṇva</em> and the <em>Mādhyandina</em>. Hence the Upaniṣad also is found to have two recensions.</p>
			<p>The seventh section—each such section is known as a &#x2018;brāhmaṇa&#x2019;—of the third chapter of this Upaniṣad is called <em>Antaryāmi Brāhmaṇa</em> since it deals with the topic of Brahman as the antaryāmin (&#x2018;the indwelling spirit&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>The third chapter starts with the convening of a conference of &#x2018;knowers of Brahman&#x2019; by the king Janaka of Videha, who expresses a desire to know the best among them (brahmiṣṭha), and offers rich presents. The sage Yājñavalkya comes forward to take away the presents even before proving his mettle in the assembly. This naturally enrages the assembled sages who start challenging him with intricate philosophical queries. However, Yājñavalkya proves more than a match for all of them.</p>
			<p>The seventh brāhmaṇa—which is the <em>Antaryāmi Brāhmaṇa</em>—starts with the question of Uddālaka Āruṇi about the antaryāmin or the indwelling spirit in the universe. Yājñavalkya replies that it is the Ātman or the Self that resides in everything, whether it is the elements like the earth, or the worlds like heaven or living beings or sense organs or mind, and controls them all from within. He knows them but they know him not. He is actually the knower and can never become an object of perception or knowledge. He is the eternal Self of all.</p>
			<p>If the <em>Kāṇvaśākhā</em> stops with this, the <em> Mādhyandinaśakhā</em> continues the description and adds &#x2018;ya ātmani tiṣṭhan...&#x2019; (&#x2018;who, remaining inside the ātman...&#x2019;) which lends strength to the belief that the ātman (the individual self) and Brahman (the Supreme Self) are different and that the latter controls the former. This comes in handy for the dualistic schools like Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta to defend their position.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;One who controls from within&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the Upaniṣads, Brahman is both the immanent and the transcendent Reality. Having created the world, Brahman enters into it (<em>vide Taittirīyopaniṣad</em> 2.6) and controls it from within (<em>vide Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad</em> 3.7.3-23). In this aspect it is called the &#x2018;antaryāmin,&#x2019; the inner controller.</p>
			<p>In Advaita Vedānta, the individual self is ultimately identical with the antar-yāmin. But in Dvaita and Viśiṣṭādvaita, the two are different.</p>
			<p>In the Pāñcarātra school of Vaiṣṇa-vism, God manifests himself in four forms retaining the para or the highest form in his world called Vaikuṇṭha: vyūha (the four emanations), vibhava (incarnations), arca (manifestation through the image during worship) and antaryāmin (the inner controller). According to this school, the last is only a partial manifestation.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Division of society based on the nature and nurture of the individuals as also their professions is a phenomenon found in many parts of the civilized world. In the special context of India&#x2019;s ancient history when races and cultures battled and blended, this division also took a unique shape. This is known as the &#x2018;jātipaddhati&#x2019; or caste system. Jāti also means birth. Since children usually adopted the professions of their fathers and forefathers, caste came to acquire a functional character in a self-contained economy and a social structure, based on traditional values.</p>
			<p>The varṇa system from which caste is supposed to have originated was a simple division based on guṇa (natural characteristics) and karma (action, acts, vocation). This gradually developed into a labyrinth of jātis and upajātis or castes and sub-castes most of which were grouped under an umbrella term called the &#x2018;śūdras.&#x2019; Even among such castes, a few were pushed to the lowest rung of the social ladder because of their unclean food habits and amoral attitude which were unacceptable to the rest of society. Hence the name &#x2018;antyaja&#x2019; (&#x2018;the last-born&#x2019;). Probably for the same reason they were also considered aspṛśyas or untouchables. However, neither in the Vedas nor in the earlier smṛtis and dharmaśāstras have they been treated as such, but only as śūdras. The practice of untouchability seems to be a post-Vedic phenomenon.</p>
			<p>Some of the castes branded as antyajas are: caṇḍāla, rajaka (the washerman), carmakāra (worker in hides), buruḍa (bamboo worker), kaivarta (the fisherman) and bhilla (of a forest-tribe or a hill-tribe).</p>
			<p>During the medieval ages, these castes had often risen in social status due to their organization and wealth.</p>
			<p>Though caste barriers have existed in some form all along at social levels, birth in a low caste has never been considered a bar to spiritual enlightenment as depicted in the story of Dharmavyādha (<em>vide Mahābharata, Vanaparva</em>, 210). Indian history is replete with stories of great saints, who, though born as antyajas, rose to very high spiritual states and were recognized and respected as such by the society. To mention only a few: Kaṇṇappa, Raidās, Cokkameḷa, Nandanār and Tiruppāṇi.</p>
			<p>Eradication of untouchability which is a social curse, has been attempted by several religious and social leaders in India throughout the centuries. The success, however, has not been proportionate to the efforts put forth. Economic, educational and cultural upliftment of the masses is the only solution to this social malady. Since independence the Indian Constitution has positively forbidden the observance, in any form, of untouchability and these socially disabled communities are being given special consideration in matters of education and employment, and, many economic benefits.</p>

			<p>Apart from the four varṇas or groups of people in the society, a very large number of jātis or castes which have come into being as a result of mixing up of these varṇas, have been mentioned in the Hindu religious works. The names of most of these castes actually indicate their vocations and often, the status of the caste group depended upon the type of profession followed by it.</p>
			<p>The groups considered almost as outside the pale of the caste system were called &#x2018;antyajas&#x2019; (&#x2018;the least-born) and those considered as the last even among them were named &#x2018;antyāvasāyins,&#x2019; for instance, caṇḍālas and śvapacas (eaters of dog&#x2019;s flesh). They were considered as untouchables even among the untouchables and used to live in cemeteries. They were disqualified from appearing as witnesses in legal disputes.</p>

			<p>According to the dharmaśāstras, a Hindu is expected to lead his life reli-giously. At every stage of his life he is expected to perform or undergo certain religious ceremonies which will add a peculiar excellence not only to his body but also to his mind and spirit. This is technically called &#x2018;saṁskāra&#x2019; (purificatory rite or sacrament). Out of the sixteen such saṁskāras (called ṣoḍaśa-saṁskāras) antyeṣṭi is the one that comes at the very end. It is the grand finale of a life that has been well-lived.</p>
			<p>As the very name indicates (antya = end, death) it is performed on the death of a person, by his survivors, usually the sons or the nearest male relatives. Since cremation seems to have been the general rule among the Vedic Āryans, it was considered as a sacrifice (iṣṭi = sacrifice). It was believed that Agni, the fire-god, who acted as a messenger between gods and men, would lead the soul of the dead to the next world.</p>
			<p>On the approach of death, the person who is expecting to die shortly, bids farewell to the assembled relatives and the world. Alms and gifts are distributed. Oblations are offered into the sacrificial fire maintained by him. In the modern days dropping the water of Gaṅgā and tulasī leaves into his mouth are in vogue. The body is removed in a bier specially prepared and taken in a procession to the cremation ground, being led by the chief mourner (usually the eldest son). A cow is let free on this occasion. She is called &#x2018;anustaraṇī&#x2019; and is believed to be helpful in crossing the ocean of mortality. The corpse after washing is laid on the pyre and fire is applied with appropriate Vedic mantras (like <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 10.16.1). After udakakarma (offering of water) and consoling the mourners, the nearest relatives observe aśauca (ceremonial impurity) usually for three days. Later on, the bones are gathered (asthisañcayana) and immersed in a holy river or the sea. Śrāddha ceremonies are followed by sapiṇḍīkaraṇa (affiliation of the dead with the manes).</p>

			<p>The smallest part of a physical substance which cannot be divided further, is called aṇu (and sometimes, paramāṇu). According to the Vaiśeṣika system of philosophy, the four elements viz., earth, water, air and fire are atomic in size. The perceptible elements are formed out of a combination of these atoms.</p>
			<p>The Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta and the Pāśupata system of Śaivism consider the ātman (the individual soul) as aṇu or atomic in size.</p>
			<p>The word is sometimes used to indicate a minute unit of time also: 54,675,000th part of a muhūrta (of 48 minutes). In prosody it is the fourth part of a mātrā (syllabic instant).</p>

			<p>Works on Advaita Vedānta usually commence with the description of the anunbandha-catuṣṭaya. Anubandha is that which connects or binds, the factors which bind the entire system together into a connected whole. There are four such factors and hence the word &#x2018;catuṣṭaya&#x2019; (a group of four).</p>
			<p>The first anubandha is &#x2018;adhikārin,&#x2019; the person competent to study and practise the science. The second is &#x2018;viṣaya,&#x2019; the subject matter dealt with in the treatise. The third is &#x2018;prayojana,&#x2019; utility to be gained by its study and practice. The last is &#x2018;sambandha&#x2019; or connection, usually between the book that purports to deal with the science and the science itself, or, between the work and the utility promised.</p>
			<p>Though this is used as a &#x2018;technical word&#x2019; in Advaita literature, it is a general concept that can be applied to other fields of knowledge also.</p>

			<p>Towards the end of the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice, after the udayanīya rite, a barren cow used to be immolated and sacrificed to the gods Mitra and Varuṇa. This cow was called anu(ū)bandhyā. Sometimes three barren cows used to be sacrificed to Mitrā-Varuṇa, Viśvedevas and Bṛhaspati, as in Vājapeya, Rājasūya and Sattra yāgas. Substitutes of pāyasam (pudding) and āmikṣā (curdled milk) have also been mentioned, even in the earlier works. Sacrifice of these cows has been given up long since.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Upaniṣads contain the highest flights of Hindu philosophical thought. Since they are not the works of a single author and do not appear to propound a single system of philosophical thought, Bādarāyaṇa-Vyāsa undertook to streamline and systematize their thoughts through his well-known work called <em>Brahmasūtras</em>. (See <ref>BRAHMASŪTRAS</ref> for details.) This work, being in the form of aphorisms, could not be easily comprehended without the aid of a suitable commentary. Since it commanded a great respect in the Hindu philosophical tradition, several ācāryas (spiritual and reli-gious preceptors) owing allegiance to different thought systems, wrote expositions on it, attempting to show that it expounds their system of philosophy. Among such ācāryas, Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja and Madhva have been considered the chief ones.</p>
			<p>Madhvācārya (A. D. 1238-1317) the chief exponent of the Dvaita Vedānta (dualistic Vedānta) is reputed to have written four works on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>: the <em>Brahmasūtrabhāṣya, Anuvyākhyāna, Nyāyavivaraṇa</em> and <em>Aṇubhāṣya</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Aṇubhāṣya</em>, as the very name indicates, is a very small (aṇu = tiny) metrical work comprising 32 ślokas (verses) in the simple anuṣṭubh metre, divided into four chapters of 8 ślokas each. This is said to have been composed by Madhva for the convenience of his disciples who were in the habit of reading the entire bhāṣya on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> before taking their food.</p>
			<p>The first chapter expounds the greatness of Lord Viṣṇu, who is the source of all beings and things. The second chapter brings out the untenability of interpretations of the Upaniṣaḍic passages by other schools like the Sāṅkhya. The third chapter extols jñāna (knowledge of God) and advises the aspirants to eschew evil deeds and perform only good deeds. An important doctrine that is set forth here is that there is gradation even in mukti (liberation). The last chapter describes ways of attaining mukti.</p>
			<p><em>Aṇubhāṣya</em> is also known as <em>Sarva-śāstrārtha-saṅgraha</em> and has several commentaries by Jayatīrtha, Ananta Bhaṭṭa, Rāghavendra Tīrtha and others.</p>
			<p>Vallabhācārya (A. D. 1481—1533) another of the well-known ācāryas of the pluralistic schools, has written a commentary on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> called <em>Aṇubhāṣya</em> which, again, has a few sub-commentaries.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Vedic Saṁhitās have been preserved for millennia due to the well-orga-nized system of &#x2018;svaras&#x2019; or intonations. Such svaras are of three types: udātta, anudātta and svarita. They are generally translated as &#x2018;raised,&#x2019; &#x2018;not raised&#x2019; and &#x2018;falling.&#x2019; They are musical in nature.</p>
			<p>The anudātta is indicated by a horizontal line below the letter, the udātta without any sign and the svarita with a vertical line above the letter. For instance: Oṁ <u>sa</u>ha n&#x101;&#x30d;āvavatu. Here &#x2018;<u>sa</u>&#x2019; is an anudātta and &#x2018;n&#x30d;a&#x2019; is a svarita. The other letters are all udātta.</p>
			<p>While chanting, the udātta letters are chanted as the basic note (&#x2018;sa&#x2019; or ṣaḍja of music), the anudātta as one note below (&#x2018;ni&#x2019; or niṣāda) and the svarita as one note above (&#x2018;ri&#x2019; or ṛṣabha).</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;following the <em>Gītā</em>&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The immense popularity of the <em>Bhagavadgītā—</em>generally known as the <em>Gītā</em>—inspired a number of authors of didactic literature to produce more such works. Most of these are imitations and are almost always incorporated into bigger works like the epics and the purāṇas. There are as many as thirty six such gītās, out of which sixteen are from the <em>Mahābhārata</em> alone. <em>Anugītā</em> is one such and perhaps better known than the others. The name &#x2018;Anugītā&#x2019; is derived from the fact that it purports to follow (anu = following) the <em>Gītā</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Anugītā</em> comprises chapters 16-51 of the fourteenth book (<em>Āśvamedhikaparva</em>) of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> and is in the form of a dialogue between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. Being eager to recapitulate the teachings of the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, Arjuna requests Śrī Kṛṣṇa for the same. After taking Arjuna to task for having forgotten the teaching so soon and confessing that he is not in a high state of yoga now, Śrī Kṛṣṇa gives him another set of teachings, mostly by reciting stories and dialogues that took place between sages of yore.</p>
			<p>The topics dealt with in this gītā can be briefly indicated as follows: the travels and travails of the jīva or the individual soul, karma and rebirth, means of attaining mokṣa or liberation, jñānayajña or knowledge compared to a sacrifice, a description of the prāṇas or vital airs, the greatness of the antaryāmin or the inner controller, spiritual experience described with the allegory of a forest, story of Paraśurāma, description of the three guṇas and their effects, creation, greatness of spiritual wisdom, duties of people in the four āśramas, individual and Supreme selves, nature of austerity, nature of ātman or Self.</p>
			<p>The section comprising the chapters 20-34 is called <em>Brāhmaṇagītā</em> since it was taught by an enlightened brāhmaṇa to his wife.</p>

			<p>Temples and image worship have had a long history in Hindu religion and culture. Each of the three main cults of Hinduism, viz., Śaivism, Śāktaism and Vaiṣṇavism has given rise to a variety of icons during the course of its evolution. One set of such icons pertaining especially to Lord Śiva, showing benediction to his devotees is called &#x2018;anugraha-mūrti.&#x2019;</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Iconographical works record six such anugrahamūrtis, mūrtis or icons showing anugraha or benediction to Caṇḍeśa (one of the attendants of Śiva), Nandīśvara (Śiva&#x2019;s mount), Viṣṇu, Vighneśvara or Gaṇeśa, Arjuna (the Pāṇḍava hero) and Rāvaṇa (the demon king of Laṅkā). One hand of the image is usually kept on the head of the supplicant while one of the other hands exhibits abhayamudrā (protec-tion—giving pose) or varadamudrā (boon-giving pose).</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Vedas, the basic scriptures of Hinduism, grew in volume in course of time to such a proportion that it became very difficult to retain them in memory. Realizing this, sages like Śaunaka and Kātyāyana composed special works which gave tables of contents of the Vedas as also index of hymns and words. Such works are called &#x2018;anukramaṇī&#x2019; or &#x2018;anu-kramaṇikā.&#x2019; They usually give the first words of Vedic hymns, names of ṛṣis (sages) and chandas (metre) as also of the devatās (deities) arranged in the same manner as they occur in the originals.</p>
			<p>Śaunaka is said to have written ten such works on the <em>Ṛgveda,</em> like <em>Ārṣānu-kramaṇī, Chando&#x2019;nukramaṇī</em> and <em>Deva-tānukramaṇī</em>. The famous <em>Bṛhaddevatā</em> is included in this series.</p>
			<p>The anukramaṇī literature pertaining to the <em>Ṛgveda</em> has been greatly enriched by the <em>Sarvānukramaṇī</em> of another sage Kātyāyana. This is an excellent compendium of all indices in one place. Kātyāyana is reputed to have written an anukramaṇī on the <em>Śukla Yajurveda</em> also. Atri and Cārāyāṇa have authored two independent anukramaṇīs on the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>.</p>
			<p><em>Sāmaveda</em> has two anukramaṇīs: <em>Ārṣa</em> and <em>Daivata</em>.</p>
			<p>The anukramaṇī literature of the <em>Atharvaveda</em> is called &#x2018;pariśiṣṭa&#x2019; (appendix). Of the 70 pariśiṣṭas known to exist, <em>Caraṇavyūha</em>, the 49th, is the most celebrated.</p>
			<p>All these works are mostly written in either the śloka (metrical, verse) or the sūtra (aphorism) style.</p>

			<p>Anything that is the prescribed or accepted order is termed &#x2018;anuloma&#x2019; as opposed to &#x2018;pratiloma&#x2019; (&#x2018;opposed to the hair or grain&#x2019;) which indicates the reverse order. The word is widely used with regard to marriages and castes. An anuloma marriage is one in which the male is of a higher caste than the female. Offsprings of such unions belong to a set of castes called anuloma castes.</p>
			<p>In the pratiloma marriage the male is of a lower caste than the female and the offsprings belong to pratiloma castes.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Indian systems of philosophy have paid considerable attention to the problem of knowledge and the means of obtaining it. The object to be known is called &#x2018;prameya&#x2019; (&#x2018;that which is measured or known&#x2019;), the means of knowing it is &#x2018;pramāṇa&#x2019; (&#x2018;the measure&#x2019;) and the know-ledge obtained thus is &#x2018;pramā&#x2019; (&#x2018;that which is measured&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>The pramāṇas accepted by the various schools vary from two to six. However, almost all the theistic schools are agreed on three of them and consider them as more basic. They are: pratyakṣa (direct perception), anumāna (inference) and āptavākya (testimony), the āgama or scriptural testimony being considered the highest in the last category.</p>
			<p>When smoke is seen on a distant hill, though fire itself is not seen directly, we conclude that there is fire on the hill since smoke is invariably associated with fire. Here, the means of our know-ledge of fire on the hill is &#x2018;anumāna&#x2019; or inference. We are measuring (mā = to measure) or knowing the object of know-ledge (fire), following (anu = to follow) a given premise (i.e., the smoke and the invariable concomitance of smoke with fire known to exist from our earlier experiences).</p>
			<p>Some technical terms commonly used while defining anumāna are: &#x2018;sādhya&#x2019; (what is to be proved; here, the fire), &#x2018;hetu&#x2019; (the cause for such inference; here, smoke) and &#x2018;pakṣa&#x2019; (that which takes a side, or causes doubts; here, the hill).</p>

			<p>There are several Vedic sacrifices performed on different days, determined by the phases of the moon. The moon rising on the 15th day of the bright fortnight, which is still associated with the 14th day (caturdaśī), will have one kalā or digit less. It is said that iṣṭis (sacrifices) performed on that day are received favourably by the gods and manes. In Vedic literature the day itself is personified as the goddess Anumati. She is to be propitiated with oblations at a certain stage during the Rājasūya sacrifice.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Out of the six pramāṇas (means of obtaining knowledge) accepted by the (Bhāṭṭa) Mīmāṁsā and the Advaita Vedānta systems of Indian philosophy, anupalabdhi or non-perception forms the last. It is one of the five sources of non-perceptual knowledge.</p>
			<p>According to the Mīmāṁsā epistemo-logy of Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, the non-perception of an object is a source of our immediate cognition of the non-existence (abhāva) of that object. For instance, how is the non-existence of a jar on the table in front of us, known? It is known from the absence of its cognition, since, being a negative fact, it cannot be perceived through the senses.</p>
			<p>Can we not get this knowledge through anumāna or inference? Why should we accept an additional source of knowledge? No, we cannot; because there is no concomitant relationship between non-perception and non-existence, as for instance in the case of non-perception in the dark. Hence anupalabdhi as an additional means of knowledge must be accepted. However, it is to be noted that if a thing would have been perceived under given circumstances, but not perceived, then only its anupalabdhi or non-perception becomes a proof of its non-existence. Such anupalabdhi is sometimes called &#x2018;yogyānupalabdhi.&#x2019;</p>

		<description>
			<p>Human beings are generally prone to commit sins due to certain basic weaknesses inherent in the psycho-physical system. For instance, hunger and sex or passions and prejudices. When they are not sublimated or controlled or not let out through outlets approved by dharma (righteousness or religious laws) sin will result. A sin is generally termed &#x2018;pātaka,&#x2019; that which makes one fall (pat = to fall), from the ideal.</p>
			<p>The smṛtis and dharmaśāstras have categorised the sins in various ways. Anupātaka is one such, considered less than mahāpātaka (grievous sin) but in effect almost approaches it. False accusations against one&#x2019;s guru (father or preceptor) and sexual relationship with women like the wife of a learned brāhmaṇa or those seeking one&#x2019;s protection are two such sins.</p>
			<p>A sin must be expiated. Various kinds of expiations known as prāyaścittas are prescribed for the various crimes. As regards the anupātakas, the prāyaścittas are almost the same as the ones prescribed for the mahāpātakas. Performing Aśva-medha sacrifice and visiting places of pilgrimage are prominently mentioned in this list of prāyaścittas for the anupātakas.</p>

			<p>Hinduism believes in the theory of karma (actions) and punarjanma (reincarnation). As a result of puṇya (meritorious deeds), the jīva (the individual) is said to go to svargaloka (heaven) or candraloka (the lunar world) and return to the earth after the merit is used up. Even after this puṇya is exhausted, there are other karmas still left over, which will fructify and give the jīva further births and experiences. Such residual karma is called anuśaya.</p>

			<p>The <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em>, the basic scripture of Hinduism, is divided into ten books each of which is called &#x2018;maṇḍala.&#x2019; Each maṇḍala is again divided into several subsections called anuvākas. The anuvākas are further subdivided into sūktas, each sūkta containing one or more ṛks (verses). There are 85 anuvākas in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>.</p>

			<p>Performance of Vedic rites involves several complex processes. Appropriate Vedic hymns selected from the various sections of the Vedas (mostly from the <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā)</em> have to be chanted or sung at certain specified stages during these rites. Such hymns are categorized as yājyā, anuvākyā, śastra and so on.</p>
			<p>The anuvākyā hymns—also called puronuvākyā—are to be chanted by the hotṛ (priest reciting the ṛks) when the adhvaryu (priest following the <em>Yajurveda</em>) cuts the puroḍāśa (cakes for offering) into several parts. They are actually invitations to the respective deities to accept the offerings allotted to them. Since the name of the particular deity appears in the first part of the hymn, the hymn itself is also called puronuvākyā (puras = first, in front). For instance, <em>Ṛgveda</em> 8.44.12 and 1.91.11 are used as anuvākyās.</p>

			<p>Jainism lays a great emphasis on the practise of moral and ethical virtues. This emphasis is often on the negative rather than on the positive side. For instance, in the practice of ahiṁsā (non-violence) the stress is on non-injury rather than on love. The basic idea behind this attitude seems to be the great and urgent need to restrain those evil propensities at the individual level which, if unchecked, will lead to chaos and conflict at the social level.</p>
			<p>Anyone desirous of obtaining kaivalya (spiritual emancipation) should strive to develop saṁyak-cāritrya (virtuous conduct) by avoiding evil deeds which generate sin. Five such disciplines which help counter the five basic human weaknesses are listed as follows: ahiṁsā (not harming others), amṛṣā (not uttering falsehood), asteya (not stealing), amaithuna (not engaging in sexual intercourse) and aparigraha (not accepting gifts). Amṛṣā and amaithuna are sometimes termed satya and brahmacarya.</p>
			<p>When these disciplines are to be practised almost to an absolute degree—as in the case of the monks—they are called &#x2018;mahāvratas&#x2019; or &#x2018;the great vows.&#x2019; However, the householders whose capacity and opportunity to practise these disciplines are restricted by the very nature and circumstances of their life, are permitted certain exceptions. For example, violence or injury to beings which is inevitable while earning one&#x2019;s livelihood or in day-to-day activities like cooking, is tolerated. Similarly the householder is allowed to enjoy conjugal happiness with his wife. So, in his case these vratas become &#x2018;aṇuvratas&#x2019; or &#x2018;the small vows.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, even the householder is advised to gradually intensify and perfect the practise of these vows.</p>
			<p>Patañjali, the great teacher of yoga, also has accepted this division (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 2.1) by implication.</p>

			<p>The Vedānta Darśana, considered to be the crown-jewel of all the Hindu philosophical systems, is based on the three basic works known as &#x2018;prasthāna-traya.&#x2019; Prasthānatraya comprises the Upaniṣads, the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> and the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>. Any philosophical or reli-gious system, to be acceptable to the Hindu tradition, had to acknowledge the authority of these three works, or at least, not contradict them.</p>
			<p>Of these three works, the <em>Brahma-sūtras</em>, also known as the <em>Vedāntasūtras</em> or <em>Śārīrakasūtras</em>, is a compendium of Upaniṣadic thoughts presented in a syste-matic manner. Since the sūtras (aphorisms) of this work are as enigmatic as they are laconic, several sages and savants have tried to expound their true meaning and purport through erudite commentaries.</p>
			<p>One of the more important savants who have composed such commentaries on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> is Madhvācārya (A. D. 1197—1276) also known as Ānandatīrtha. He is the first acārya (teacher) to syste-matize the dvaita school of Vedānta, based on the prasthānatraya.</p>
			<p>Madhvācārya is reputed to have composed four commentaries on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>: <em>Brahmasūtra Bhāṣya</em>, <em>Anuvyākhyāna</em>, <em>Nyāyavivaraṇa</em> and <em>Aṇubhāṣya</em>.</p>
			<p>It is said that <em>Anuvyākhyāna</em>, the second work, was composed by Madhvā-cārya at the instance of Trivikrama Paṇḍita, one of his more important disciples, who was not satisfied with the Bhāṣya since it was not sufficiently polemical.</p>
			<p>The <em> Anuvyākhyāna</em>, a metrical master-piece in 900 verses is a highly polemical work which subjects all other schools of interpretation opposed to the dvaita system to a ruthlessly critical examination. The most celebrated work of Jayatīrtha (A. D. 1345-1388), the <em>Nyāya-sudhā</em>, is actually a commentary on the <em>Anuvyākhyāna</em>. The work closely follows the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, chapter by chapter, in its essential logical position.</p>
			<p>The more important topics discussed may be briefly summed up as follows: Oṅkāra is the designation of Brahman and the purport of the Vedas; God is supremely independent and the whole creation depends upon Him; all bondage is real; the universe is real; but emancipation is possible by the grace of God.</p>
			<p>The work devotes a major part to the criticism of Advaita Vedānta.</p>

			<p>Indian philosophical systems, called darśanas, have analyzed the phenomenon of knowledge in all its aspects. Out of the several pramāṇas or means of knowledge, pratyakṣa or direct perception is universally accepted and placed as the first in the series.</p>
			<p>When a pot is seen by the eyes and the knowledge &#x2019;This is a pot&#x2018; arises in the mind, such a knowledge is called vyavasāya or determinate cognition. However, this is immediately followed by another knowledge &#x2018;I know this pot&#x2019; thus relating the earlier knowledge to the self. Since this vyavasāya or cognition rises <em>after</em> the first, it is termed &#x2018;anuvyavasāya&#x2019; (anu = after).</p>
			<p>This is a later doctrine developed by the Nyāya school.</p>

			<p>Among the few sacrifices that an āhitāgni (one who has ceremonially kindled the Vedic fires) is expected to perform regularly, Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa should specially be mentioned. They belong to the class called &#x2018;iṣṭi&#x2019; (needing four priests) and are performed on the new-moon day and full-moon day respectively.</p>
			<p>During these sacrifices, certain minor offerings are made before and after the principal offerings. Such offerings made before the principal ones are called prayājas (pra = before) and those made after the principal ones are termed anuyājas (anu = after).</p>
			<p>The prayājas are oblations of ājya (clarified butter or ghee) and are five in number, addressed to deities like samidhaḥ, narāśaṁsa and others.</p>
			<p>The anuyājas are only three and offered to barhis, narāśaṁsa and agni sviṣṭakṛt.</p>

			<p>Strīdhana or a woman&#x2019;s property is an important topic discussed by the writers of the dharmaśāstras. A perusal of Vedic and early dharmaśāstra literature reveals that women had an honoured place in the Hindu society. References are not wanting to show that they were given gifts and endowed with property of which they could be independent owners (<em>Ṛgveda</em> 10.85.13 and 38; <em>Āpastamba Dharmasūtras</em> 2.6.14.9).</p>
			<p>Among the five or six varieties of strīdhana mentioned, anvādheya is one. It is generally defined as what is obtained by a woman <em>after</em> (anu = after) her marriage, from the family of her husband as also from the family of her father&#x2019;s kinsmen. It could include all kinds of movable property.</p>

			<p>In the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice the yajamāna (sacrificer) is advised to gift away cooked rice as sacrificial fee to the priests after cooking it on one of the fires, the dakṣiṇāgni. This is meant to offset whatever defects might have been accrued to the sacrifice due to errors of omission and commission. This is called anvāhārya.</p>
			<p>Since anvāhārya is cooked on the dakṣiṇāgni, the latter is also called anvāhārya-pacana.</p>

			<p>Performing religious rites in honour of the departed ancestors and to satisfy their spirits is a universal phenomenon. In Hinduism such rites are called &#x2018;śrāddha&#x2019; (literally, that which is performed with śraddhā or faith). The anvaṣṭakā, also called anvaṣṭakya, is a śrāddha rite per-formed after the aṣṭakā rite (anu = after).</p>
			<p>After establishing the fire and erecting a shed round it, offerings like boiled rice, pudding, preparations made out of curds as also liquor and scum of boiled rice are spread over barhis (sacrificial grass). After offering some portion into the fire, the rest are dedicated to the manes and their wives. The meat of an animal immolated on the aṣṭakā day should be cooked and offered to the brāhmaṇas invited for the ceremony.</p>
			<p>The aṣṭakā type of śrāddhas gradually went out of vogue.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The two words, anvaya and vyatireka, are frequently used in Indian works of philosophy and logic to prove a point. They invariably go together. Anvaya is a positive statement indicating a universal agreement whereas vyatireka is the opposite of it, proving the same point by indicating the universal absence of the contrary.</p>
			<p>To illustrate: Smoke is seen on the yonder hill. We conclude that there is fire on that hill. This conclusion is based on two premises from our previous experience:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Wherever there is smoke, there is fire;</li>
				<li>Wherever there is no fire, there is no smoke.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Of these, the first one is a positive statement, asserting the presence of fire wherever there is smoke. Hence it is called anvaya-vyāpti, or simply anvaya. The second statement asserts a negative factor, the universal absence of smoke when there is no fire. This is called vyatireka-vyāpti or vyatireka (negation or contrariety). To prove the existence of fire on the hill on the evidence of smoke, both these methods of argument are necessary.</p>

			<p>Ancient works on polity often mention ānvīkṣikī as one of the four sciences to be taught compulsorily to the princes, especi-ally the one who will become the next king. Literally the word means something to be reflected upon (īkṣ = to reflect) after (anu = after) hearing about the same from the preceptor. Hence, the earliest connotation seems to be &#x2018;philo-sophy,&#x2019; the same as was later on known as &#x2018;darśana.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>However, the word has been used in later literature more exclusively to denote the logical sciences, tarkaśāstra or Nyāya.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the topics considered to be very important and hence frequently discussed in the works of Indian philosophy and logic is the relationship between kāraṇa, the cause and kārya, the effect. With regard to a given effect, determining its cause or causes, both primary and subsidiary, is of great significance since the same methods of logic will have to be extended to determine the final cause of this universe.</p>
			<p>A given effect might have been produced by a single cause or several causes. Again, among these several causes one might be primary and the others secondary. To illustrate: a pot is a kārya or effect. Its kāraṇas or causes are clay, potter&#x2019;s wheel, stick and the potter himself. Though all these are causes, clay is the primary cause and all the others are secondary causes. What is common to all these causes is that they are immediately <em>antecedent</em> to the effect, the pot. However, any other thing, merely by its being antecedent to the pot, cannot be considered as its cause. For instance, the ass that brings the clay, the sound made by the potter&#x2019;s wheel or the stick or the potter&#x2019;s father—none of these can be considered as the cause of the pot since its coming into existence can be demonstrated otherwise i.e., without reference to this parti-cular cause also. Such causes are said to be anyathā-siddha (anyathā = otherwise, siddha = demonstrated), and hence rejec-ted as superfluous.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Darśanas or Indian philosophical systems often take recourse to disputing the claims of other schools, to establish their own. In order to achieve this they have to resort to logic and reasoning, arguments and counter-arguments, pushing their opponent to a dead end or a vicious circle. Such positions are accepted as fallacious and hence invalidated.</p>
			<p>Anyonyāśraya (mutual or reciprocal dependence) is one such defect. To illustrate: If the body is produced by karma, how is karma produced? By the body of course! Or, when I look at this pot and get the knowledge that this is a pot, how did I obtain it? By seeing it. How could I get that knowledge unless I had recognized it as a pot? That means, I must have already known it as a pot!</p>
			<p>To sum up:</p>
			<p>A situation in which a concept cannot be understood without reference to another which in turn cannot be understood without reference to the first, is a position of &#x2018;anyonyāśraya&#x2019; or mutual dependence which is held to be a defect in reasoning.</p>
			<p>Works on logic sometimes go into details or categorisation of this fallacy, which however do not add to our basic knowledge of the concept as such.</p>

			<p>The reception given in their honour is called &#x2018;apaciti&#x2019; or &#x2018;argha&#x2019; and consists of offering a seat to sit on, pādya (water for washing feet), arghya (water for washing hands), ācamana (water for rinsing mouth) and madhuparka (a preparation of honey and other ingredients).</p>

		<description>
			<p>If there is any word which is repea-tedly and most extensively used in the Hindu (as also Jaina and Buddhist) reli-gious works, it is the word &#x2018;dharma.&#x2019; Out of the several connotations that have evolved over the centuries, &#x2018;code of conduct&#x2019; and &#x2018;duty and responsibility&#x2019; are two which have been more widely accepted.</p>
			<p>This interpretation has been almost universally applied to the varṇa-dharmas (See <ref>VARṆĀŚRAMA-DHARMA</ref>.) and āśrama dharmas. Members of each of the four varṇas (brāhmaṇas, kṣattriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras) have been allotted their respective duties and responsibilities; as for instance, Vedic studies and preaching for the brāhmaṇas, fighting and administration for the kṣattriyas and so on. They are normally expected to follow these avocations. However, in times of great calamities like war, floods or famine, when the whole social fabric becomes disturbed, or during a period of severe crisis in the individual&#x2019;s life, it may not be strictly possible for them to do so.</p>
			<p>At such periods of āpad or calamity, the dharmaśāstras allow people to take to any dharma or avocation, even the ones allotted to others, as an emergency measure, to sustain themselves. Thus a brāhmaṇa can take to fighting or trade, or a kṣattriya to agriculture or commerce. Both may accept menial service under others. However, even in dire calamities one is advised not to accept service under evil persons. As soon as normalcy returns they are expected to go back to the original way of life.</p>
			<p>Since life is most precious, to save it in times of grave danger, one can transgress all normal rules. Viśvāmitra&#x2019;s readiness to consume the flesh of a dog after stealing it from the house of an outcaste during a severe famine is the classic example quoted in mythological works to illustrate this point.</p>

			<p>In the Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika darśanas, the systems of Indian logic, a five-membered syllogism is often resorted to, to prove a point. They are:</p>

				<li>pratijñā (statement of assertion);</li>
				<li>hetu (reason for the assertion);</li>
				<li>udāharaṇa (example containing a universal proposition);</li>

			<p>From the most ancient times the Hindus have believed that mind is a product of the food we take, even as the body is, and that purity of food is conducive to the purity of mind (<em>vide Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> 7.26.2). As a corollary of the doctrine it was also believed that food handled by persons of doubtful integrity could be defiled and the same had to be purified by appropriate rites. The doctrine seems to have been further extended to declare that certain classes of people, if they were allowed to sit in the same paṅkti (row of people sitting for food), could defile the whole row and hence were branded as &#x2018;apāṅkteya&#x2019; or unworthy of being allowed to sit in the row along with others. Sometimes they were also called &#x2018;paṅktidūṣakas,&#x2019; those who defile the row.</p>
			<p>Though the dharmaśāstras have given long lists of persons who are apāṅkteya, the lists vary from book to book. <em>Manusmṛti</em> (3.150-166) by far gives the longest list, of 93 persons.</p>
			<p>A perusal of these lists shows that persons who have given up their allotted duties (varṇadharmas) and have taken to other means of livelihood, perpetrators of heinous crimes, patients suffering from incurable or infectious diseases, those addicted to drinks and debauchery as also the others who do not follow even elementary principles of ethics and etiquette have all been stigmatized as apāṅkteyas.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hinduism advocates a cyclic theory of creation. Sṛṣṭi (creation), sthiti (preservation or sustenance) and pralaya (dissolution) go on in a cyclic order eternally. Pralaya or dissolution of the created universe is also called &#x2018;parānta,&#x2019; &#x2018;the great end.&#x2019; Compared to this, dissolution or death of the body of an individual is &#x2018;aparānta,&#x2019; &#x2018;the little end.&#x2019; Aparāntajñāna is thus the knowledge of one&#x2019;s death.</p>
			<p>Can one get it in advance? If so, how? This interesting question has been answered by Patañjali (200 B. C.) in his celebrated work, the <em>Yogasūtras</em> (3.22). If a yogi succeeds in attaining samādhi (perfect concentration culminating in superconscious experience) on the karma that has brought him into being in the present life, he can intuitively perceive when it will come to an end. This can give him a direct knowledge of the time, place and mode of his death.</p>
			<p>The yogi can obtain the same know-ledge even without samādhi on his karma, just by observing the ariṣṭas (portentous phenomena) like not hearing the usual internal sound when the ears are closed, or seeing the dead ancestors or supernatural beings. Though these ariṣṭas can be perceived even by ordinary people, it is only the yogi that can interpret them rightly and draw correct conclusions.</p>

			<p>Man casts God in his own mould. He cannot help doing it since it comes to him naturally. Again, if God is given a human form and conceived of as the Father, why not as the Mother? This seems to be the psychology behind the cult of the Śakti or the Devī, the Divine Mother.</p>
			<p>Most of the forms of Śakti are associated with Pārvatī, the divine spouse of Lord Śiva. Aparājitā (literally, one who is unconquered and unconquerable) is one such aspect. Works on Hindu iconography describe her as a very strong woman with three eyes, with her hair made up as a crown and adorned with the crescent moon, and with four arms holding pināka (Śiva&#x2019;s bow), arrow, sword and shield. The snake Vāsuki forms her wristlet. She rides a lion.</p>
			<p>The <em>Devīmāhātmya</em>, which forms a part of the <em>Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa</em>, contains a beautiful hymn titled &#x2018;Aparājitā-stotra&#x2019; (5.8-82) sung by the gods led by Indra, to appease her so that she condescends to kill the demons Śumbha and Niśumbha. Kings were expected to worship her on the Vijayadaśamī day. They would then be assured of victory in battles.</p>
			<p>The deity is known to Jaina mytho-logy also wherein she is pictured as a yakṣī (demi-goddess).</p>
			<p>The seventh day in the bright fortnight of Bhādra (usually September) is observed as Aparājitā Saptamī vrata, fasting being an important part of the discipline.</p>

			<p>Creation of the world is a favourite topic discussed in the Hindu scriptures. Most of the schools mentioned in these works are inclined to accept three basic realities from which the world has been created or evolved. They are: Īśvara or God, jīvas (the individual souls) and prakṛti (nature, the insentient matrix of the inanimate creation).</p>
			<p>The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, though not a treatise on philosophy, in its wide sweep of discussing all relevant topics, touches upon the subject of creation also. God creates the world out of his twofold prakṛti or nature: the parā-prakṛti or higher nature and the aparā-prakṛti or lower nature. The former comprises the jīvas whereas the latter consists of the three guṇas, sattva, rajas and tamas. Thus the aparā-prakṛti forms the material base from which all non-living creation emerges. (<em>vide Bhagavadgītā</em> 7.4-14)</p>

			<p>The life of an average Hindu, even today, is influenced, if not guided, by the class of works known as dharmaśāstras. Even the law-courts are guided by them, especially in cases of Hindu family disputes.</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras comprise a large body of religious literature based on the smṛtis (secondary scriptures based on the śrutis or Vedas), the gṛhyasūtras (aphoristic works dealing with the family life), the dharmasūtras (aphoristic works dealing with dharma, both at the indi-vidual level and at the social level) as also the several commentaries and compendia or digests based on them.</p>
			<p>Aparārka or Aparāditya (12th cent A.D.) is one of the writers of such literature. He has composed a voluminous commentary in verse, on the well-known smṛti of Yājñavalkya. It is later than the <em>Mitākṣarā,</em> the most celebrated commentary on the same by Vijñāneśvara (circa A. D. 1120), more voluminous but less renowned than the same.</p>
			<p>Aparāditya was a king of the Śilāhāra dynasty whose territory existed in the region of modern Sūrat and Thānā (Maharashtra State).</p>
			<p>His work is more in the nature of a digest than a commentary on the <em>Yājña-valkya Smṛti</em>. He quotes profusely from earlier works and often comments on the same. Though he does not mention the <em>Mitākṣarā</em> by name, the latter&#x2019;s views come in for criticism.</p>

		<description>
			<p>From the most ancient times know-ledge has been highly eulogised in the Hindu scriptures. Its acquisition and dissemination have been considered as a sacred duty, especially of the brāhmaṇas.</p>
			<p>One of the more well-known and earlier Upaniṣads, the <em>Muṇḍaka</em> (1.1.4, 5), classifies vidyā or knowledge into two groups: parā, the higher and aparā, the lower. Only spiritual wisdom that gives a direct experience of the imperishable Brahman, the Absolute, is classed as parā and all other branches of knowledge, whether they are sacred or secular, are relegated to the lower plane as aparā-vidyā.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that even the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, the most highly venerated scripture tops the list of aparā-vidyās. Other arts and sciences mentioned, include grammar, poetics, and astronomy.</p>
			<p>Another Upaniṣad which is equally revered and perhaps even more ancient, the <em>Chāndogya</em> (<em>vide</em> 7.1.1-3), gives a much longer list starting from the <em>Ṛgveda</em> and ending with magical sciences. By impli-cation, these vidyās have to be classed under aparā.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Spiritual illumination resulting in kaivalya or liberation is the final goal of life. This is possible only when a sinless life is led and efforts are assiduously made to purify the mind. Out of the several disciplines advocated in the Hindu reli-gious works towards this end, aparigraha (non-acceptance of things) is an important one. The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (2.30 and 39) has mentioned it under the first of the eight graded steps of yoga, viz., yama.</p>
			<p>A yogi or a spiritual aspirant, who has dedicated his life entirely for spiritual illumination, is advised not to accept gifts of material things from others, nor make efforts to obtain them otherwise, beyond the bare necessities of life. This means, he has to consciously keep in check, greed and the desire to possess and enjoy the possession of objects. This is facilitated by constant reflection on the difficulties, risks, and evils involved in obtaining such objects or protecting them.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that Patañjali assures that the yogi who observes this vow sincerely, can develop, in course of time, the supersensual knowledge about his previous and future lives.</p>

			<p>Akṣan means a sense-organ like the eye or the ear. Parokṣa means that which is removed from the sense organ, hence, indirect. Aparokṣa is that which is opposed to this, i.e., direct. All knowledge obtained through inference and verbal testimony is parokṣa. Compared to it, knowledge obtained by direct perception is aparokṣa.</p>
			<p>However in the strictest sense, even such knowledge is parokṣa or indirect only, since the sense organs and the mind intervene between the knower and the object known. &#x2018;Aparokṣānubhūti&#x2019; or &#x2018;immediate and direct experience&#x2019; is possible only with regard to the ātman, our own self. Ātman can never be apprehended or comprehended by the senses or the mind since it is the power behind them. It is to be experienced directly by itself.</p>
			<p><em>Aparokṣānubhūti</em> is also the title of a small treatise on Advaita Vedānta attri-buted to Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820). Extending over 144 verses, the work deals mainly with the various disciplines that help destroy ajñāna (ignorance of the real nature of the ātman) and manifest the ātman.</p>

			<p>To the uninitiated, idols or pictures of the Hindu gods with their wives and children, queer mounts and obsolete weapons is an enigma. It is no more so when it is conceded that they are often symbolical and when the symbolism itself is understood from competent sources.</p>
			<p>Though Lord Śiva, the great God of dissolution and the last of the Hindu Trinity, is generally worshipped in the form of the liṅga, idols depicting him in various poses are not uncommon. They are, invariably, sculptured on the walls or pillars of temples, but not formally worshipped in the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>.</p>
			<p>Out of such images of Śiva, that of Naṭarāja, &#x2018;the king of dancers&#x2019;, is the most enchanting. In this, he is shown as tramp-ling upon a dwarf-demon called &#x2018;apasmāra-puruṣa.&#x2019; He symbolises ignorance.</p>
			<p>Apasmāra, strictly speaking, is epilepsy. However, in this context, cretinism is perhaps nearer the intended sense. Just as cretinism makes a man underdeveloped both in body and in mind, even so does ignorance stunt one&#x2019;s spiritual growth.</p>
			<p>The icons of Dakṣiṇāmūrti Śiva also show him as trampling upon the apasmāra-puruṣa.</p>

			<word>Āpastamba</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Āpastamba is one of the few highly venerated ancient sages accredited with the authorship of some important religious works which are considered as authoritative even today. Tradition ascribes his works to the period Kali 450 (i.e., 2652 B. C.). However, it is impossible to confirm or deny this, as in the case of many other ancient authors.</p>
			<p>The name is sometimes spelt as &#x2018;Āpastambha&#x2019; (&#x2018;one who could restrain water&#x2019;). The mythological lore attributes to him the yogic power to stay under water for long. This would often attract the aquatic creatures to him. Fishermen interested in making a bonanza of the catch, once spread their nets in the place where he was seated in yoga and un-wittingly netted him. King Nābhāga is then said to have freed him honouring him with a cow and a calf and sent him back to his hermitage.</p>
			<p>The four or five works ascribed to him may be grouped under one title, the <em>Āpastamba Kalpasūtras</em>. The &#x2018;Kalpa&#x2019; (or Kalpasūtras) is a class of literature grouped under the Vedāṅgas (subsidiary disciplines which help grasp the purport of the Vedas better), and is further subdivided into śrauta, gṛhya, dharma and śulba. (For details, see under <ref>KALPA-SŪTRAS</ref>, <ref>ŚRAUTA-SŪTRAS</ref>, <ref>GṚHYASŪTRAS</ref>, <ref>DHARMASŪTRAS</ref> and <ref>ŚULBASŪTRAS</ref>.)</p>
			<p>The <em>Āpastamba Kalpasūtras</em> is a fairly voluminous work comprising 30 praśnas, or sections. Out of these, the first 24 praśnas, appropriating a lion&#x2019;s share, form the <em>Śrautasūtras</em>. The next two sections are called <em>Mantrapāṭha</em>. The 27th praśna is the <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em>. The next two make up the <em>Dharmasūtras</em> whereas the last is known as <em>Śulbasūtras</em>. Of course, when these works are treated as independent treatises, they are prefixed by the author&#x2019;s name. (<em>Āpastamba Śrautasūtras</em> and so on.)</p>
			<p>The <em>Śrautasūtras</em> (no. of sūs. 7590) deal exhaustively with the conduct of Vedic sacrifices from Darśapūrṇamāsa up to Aśvamedha and Puruṣamedha. It is assigned to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em> and has been commented upon by Dhūrtasvāmin and Kapardisvāmin.</p>
			<p>The <em>Mantrapāṭha</em> gives the prayers or hymns to be used at appropriate places during the conduct of rituals and sacrifices.</p>
			<p>The <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em> (no. of sūs. 389) deal mainly with the rites connected with the family (gṛha = home, family) life, like upanayana (initiation into Vedic studies), samāvartana (returning from the guru&#x2019;s house after Vedic studies), marriage, rites to be performed on the birth of children as also certain magical rites. The work has been commented upon by Haradatta Miśra and Sudarśanācārya.</p>
			<p>The <em>Dharmasūtras</em> (no. of sūs. 1381) give a fairly good account of the duties of the four āśramas and the four varṇas and also describe the sixteen saṁskāras (purificatory rites). Haradatta Miśra has written a beautiful commentary on it, which he has named as <em>Ujjvalā</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Śulbasūtras</em> is a highly technical work dealing with the construction of altars for Vedic sacrifices. Out of the three commentaries available, that of Kapardi-svāmin is the oldest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Hindu system of medicine and treatment, known as Āyurveda (&#x2018;the science of longevity&#x2019;) is as particular with regard to prescribing diet and conduct as with medicines and treatment. The former is called &#x2018;pathya, what is on the right road;&#x2019; i.e., what is in consonance with the rules of the science of treatment. For instance, in almost all cases of illness, over-eating, drinking, and preventing sleep are to be avoided. If this is done, then it is &#x2018;pathya.&#x2019; In dehydrating diseases, the patient should consume plenty of warm water. That is &#x2018;pathya&#x2019; for him.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Apathya&#x2019; is the opposite of &#x2018;pathya,&#x2019; the foods, drinks and conduct which will aggravate the disease. For instance, a patient suffering from fever should not take rice or expose himself to cold. It is &#x2018;apathya&#x2019; for him.</p>
			<p>The principles of pathya and apathya can be extended to the field of religion and spiritual life too.</p>

			<p>The sages of India were good psycho-logists. With a keen and incisive intellect, they discovered the basic urge of all human beings to get pleasure and happiness in life. They were also wise enough to perceive that this urge had to be contained by a higher motivating power, so that the greatest good of the greatest number could be achieved. This, they called &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; (righteousness) while naming the other as &#x2018;artha and kāma.&#x2019; Kāma is desire in general and artha is the means of satisfying it. The three together have been classified as &#x2018;trivarga,&#x2019; whereas mokṣa (liberation from transmigration, beatitude) which is beyond the pale of this, gets the appellation &#x2018;apavarga&#x2019; (varga = class, apa = beyond).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Aponaptrīyā is a minor ritual conduc-ted during and as a part of Somayāga. Water drawn from a river on the day prior to the extraction of the soma juice and preserved in a vessel called vasatīvarī as also the water drawn on the morning of ritual extraction kept in vessels named ekadhanā are ceremonially mixed with appropriate hymns (<em>Ṛgveda</em> 10.30). This hymn is also known by the same name as the rite itself.</p>
			<p>The hotṛ (priest, representing the <em>Ṛgveda</em>) is advised to recite the first stanza (pra devatrā brahmaṇe ...) continuously thrice. This will induce Parjanya, the rain-god, to give rains where and when necessary.</p>
			<p>This rite will also help the yajamāna (performer of sacrifice) to complete the sacrifice without any obstacles or hitch.</p>

		<description>
			<p>If Hindu religious traditions have survived the vagaries of time and onslaughts of aliens throughout history, it is not a little due to the sages, saints and seers that have emerged on the scene from time to time. They have cut out the deadwood, rejuvenated the flogging spirits and have blazen forth new vistas of spiritual life.</p>
			<p>In this religious renaissance, the part played by the Śaiva and the Vaiṣṇava saints of South India is very significant. Of the four ācāryas of the Samaya school of Śaivism, Appar comes first, the other three being Sambandhar, Sundaramūrti and Māṇikkavācakar.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Appar&#x2019; (= father) is only a title given to Tirunāvukkarasar by another great ācārya, a much younger contemporary, Tirujñāna Sambandhar or Sambandhar.</p>
			<p>Appar lived probably during the period A. D. 600—655, when the Pallava king Mahendra I was ruling at Kāñcī-puram. Having lost his parents very early, he was brought up by his saintly sister Tilakāvatiyār. Being influenced by the Jain doctrines, he got himself converted to Jainism. However, a serious crisis of health which was dispelled by the grace of Lord Śiva, the family deity, reclaimed him to his faith. It is said that the Jaina religious leaders who were dismayed at his reconversion tried to harass him through the king. However, he came unscathed, converting the king himself in the process.</p>
			<p>He travelled widely and met another great saint Sambandhar who was hardly seven years old at that time. They became fast friends and mutual admirers.</p>
			<p>A simple man of ardent faith and intense love for God, he is said to have composed in Tamil many <em>padigas</em> or decads of hymns, of which only 311 are extant. These hymns give the essence of the ancient scriptures in a simple but poetic language.</p>

		<description>
			<p>One of the few most versatile writers on Advaita philosophy, Appayya Dīkṣita was born in a village near Kāñcīpuram (Tamil Nadu), probably in A. D. 1520. A scion of a family of great scholars, he was tutored by his father Raṅgarāja Adhvarin as also by Yajñeśvara Makhīndra.</p>
			<p>Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita, the author of the well-known textbook of Sanskrit grammar, <em>Siddhānta Kaumudī</em>, was his pupil. Nīlakaṇṭha, the famous commentator of <em>Mahābhārata</em> was his grandson.</p>
			<p>Being an orthodox brāhmaṇa deeply devoted to the Vedic culture, he is said to have performed the Jyotiṣṭoma and the Vājapeya sacrifices for the good of mankind. King Narasiṁha Bhūpāla of Tanjore attended the latter and honoured him.</p>
			<p>Appayya Dīkṣita toured the south extensively and propagated both Śaivism and Advaita Vedānta. Traditional anecdotes attribute many miraculous powers to him which he had to exhibit, to counter the evil designs of Tātācārya, a contempo-rary Vaiṣṇavite scholar. Governor Cinna Bomma Nāyaka of Vellur (16th cent. A.D.) was a devoted disciple of his. He is reputed to have shed his mortal coil in the famous Cidambaram temple in a mysterious way.</p>
			<p>Appayya Dīkṣita was a prolific writer and composer. In all, he composed 104 works, the subject ranging from Śaivism to Advaita Vedānta, grammar and rhetoric as also tantra and hymnology. Out of these, the three works on the <em>Brahma-sūtras</em> and a treatise on the various aspects of Advaita are well-known. They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Nyāyarakṣāmaṇi</em>, an independent commentary on the first pāda or quarter of the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> from the standpoint of Advaita.</li>
				<li><em>Parimalā</em>, a simple but detailed gloss on the <em>Kalpataru</em> of Amalānanda, which itself is a gloss on Vācaspati Miśra&#x2019;s famous work <em>Bhāmatī</em>. Bhāmatī, again is a subcommentary on Śaṅkara&#x2019;s Bhāṣya on the <em>Brahma-sūtras</em>. The three commentaries—<em> Bhāmatī, Kalpataru</em> and <em>Parimalā—</em>have created a new school of Advaita, known as the <em>&#x2018;Bhāmatī-prasthāna.&#x2019;</em></li>
				<li><em>Śivārkamaṇidīpikā</em>, a commentary on the <em>Śrīkaṇtha-bhāṣya</em> of <em>Brahma-sūtras</em>, written from the standpoint of Śivaviśiṣṭādvaita.</li>
				<li><em>Siddhāntaleśasaṅgraha</em>, an original treatise dealing elaborately with the various aspects of Advaita doctrines developed by the post-Śaṅkara writers. This work has attracted the attention of a number of scholars who have written commentaries.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>His <em>Kuvalayānanda</em>, a work on rhetoric is studied as a standard text-book even today.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to most of the theistic systems of Hindu philosophy, prakṛti or insentient nature (sometimes called aparā-prakṛti also) is one of the fundamental constituents of the universe. It comprises the three guṇas—sattva, rajas and tamas. Not only the inanimate creation but also the bodies of living beings, are made out of this prakṛti. Hence, these bodies are called prākṛta-śarīras or &#x2018;material bodies&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>However, as opposed to this, the bodies of God in his aspects of vyūha (emanations), vibhava (incarnations) and arca (manifestation in worship), are aprākṛta-śarīras, non-material bodies. The bodies of the nityas (eternal beings) and the muktas (liberated souls) are also made of the same stuff.</p>
			<p>This non-material substance is also known as śuddhasattva and is the stuff of the &#x2018;nityavibhūti,&#x2019; the non-material infinite domain beyond prakṛti and its three guṇas.</p>

			<p>Pramāṇa and prameya are two words constantly met with in Hindu epistemo-logy. Pramāṇa is the means of knowledge and prameya is that which is thus known. For instance, when we see a pot, the act of seeing is the &#x2018;pramāṇa&#x2019; and the pot itself is the &#x2018;prameya&#x2019; (that which is measured or comprehended).</p>
			<p>All objects with name, form and qualities can be subject to comprehension and verification through the pramāṇas. However, God the transcendental Being, is beyond all such pramāṇas and hence is termed &#x2018;Apraymeya&#x2019; (lit., the immeasu-rable). He is beyond even the śāstra or āgama (the revealed scripture) which helps only in removing our miscomprehension about him and not reveal him directly.</p>
			<p>In devotional literature, the word seems to be more commonly applied to Lord Viṣṇu.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Derived from the root &#x2018;prī&#x2019; (to propitiate, to gain favour), the word &#x2018;Āprī&#x2019; refers to a group of invocatory hymns belonging to the class of &#x2018;yājyās&#x2019; (formulae of consecration). There are ten <em>Āprī-sūktas</em> in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (1.13; 1.142; 1.188; 2.3 and so on). The yajamāna (sacrificer) has to choose from these verses according to his gotra (lineage). They are recited in the Paśubandha sacrifices.</p>
			<p>Chanting of these hymns will please the concerned deities and they confer boons on the sacrificer. The deities appear to be personified objects belonging to the sacrifice, like the fuel, the sacrificial grass, the enclosure and so on, all regarded as different forms of Agni, the fire-god.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The relationship between God on the one hand, and the individual souls as also the insentient nature on the other, is a point often discussed in the theistic schools of Hindu philosophy. Reality of the external world and plurality of the individual selves is a fact of experience. Maintaining the supreme independence of God is a logical and metaphysical necessity. Reconciling these two positions needs a correct statement of the relationship between God and his creation.</p>
			<p>Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta, systematised by Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) and others, has solved this problem by accepting the acit (insentient nature) and the cit (sentient souls) as being the body of Īśvara (God), the former two being considered as &#x2018;apṛthak-siddha-viśeṣaṇas&#x2019; of the latter. To explain: In the sentence, &#x2018;This is a white cow,&#x2019; the colour whiteness depends upon the cow and cannot exist separately from the cow. Neither are the cow and the whiteness identical. Hence whiteness is an apṛthak-siddha-viśeṣaṇa, a viśeṣaṇa or attribute, which is siddha or existing, apṛthak or inseparably.</p>
			<p>Other examples quoted are: the flower and its fragrance, the vowel and the consonant, the body and the self.</p>
			<p>This approach allows for internal plurality but rejects the pluralistic view. The ultimate Truth is thus posited as an organic whole, in spite of different organs or limbs.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The apsarās are the celestial nymphs living in svargaloka (heaven). They perhaps got this name since they are supposed to move among waters, among the clouds. Their main work is to please Indra the lord of the gods, by dancing and singing. Indra often deputes them to seduce the sages engaged in severe austerities, since they may become more powerful than himself, if they succeed!</p>
			<p>They are said to have been born out of the milk-ocean when it was churned by the gods and the demons to get nectar. According to other versions they were born out of the palm of Brahmā, the creator.</p>
			<p>They are too numerous to be listed. Ūrvaśī, Raṁbhā, Menakā and Tilottamā are the most prominent among them.</p>
			<p>They are closely associated with the demigods known as &#x2018;gandharvas.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Popular Buddhism has adopted some of them, in its mythological lore.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The āstika-darśanas or systems of Indian philosophy that accept the autho-rity of the Vedas, have given the highest place to śabda-pramāṇa (scriptural testimony), also called āgama (authentic word handed down by tradition) and āpta-vākya (statement of a trustworthy person).</p>
			<p>It is impossible to obtain all know-ledge through direct perception since the range of the organs of perception is limited. Nor can inference be of much help since it is based on previous experiences which again are based on direct perception. At some stage, faith in the word, spoken or heard or read, has got to be resorted to. In fact the knowledge gained thus is enormous. Even the day-to-day life becomes impossible without believing in the authenticity of the spoken or written word.</p>
			<p>Of course, it goes without saying that the person through whom such knowledge comes, must be trustworthy and that he should have based his findings on authentic experience or sources.</p>
			<p>Coming to things divine, since they pertain to areas of supersensuous experience, only persons of the highest spiritual calibre—ṛṣis as they are called—can be the guides and the mentors. The scriptures, which are revelations handed down through them, are the highest class of āpta-vākya literature.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Yajñas or Vedic sacrifices are generally of three types: pākayajñas in which cooked articles are offered; haviryajñas in which havis or ghee is the oblation; and somayajñas in which the soma juice is the main ingredient of offering. Aptoryāma belongs to the last group. It is considered as an extension of another somayajña, viz., the Atirātra.</p>
			<p>The rite derives its name &#x2018;Aptoryāma&#x2019; from the belief that by its performance one secures whatever one desires (āp = to secure). However, it is usually performed by one who wants to obtain cattle of good breed. More than a thousand cows and a chariot with mules yoked are to be gifted away in this sacrifice.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;apūrva&#x2019; is a technical term employed by the Pūrva-mīmāṁsā system of Hindu philosophy which advocates the performance of all the prescribed Vedic rituals as the only means of obtaining the <em>summum bonum</em> of life.</p>
			<p>Vedic sacrifices are said to produce results such as attaining heaven. The doubt that naturally arises is: How can an act performed here and now produce a result much later and somewhere else? Does it not violate the law of cause and effect?</p>
			<p>This objection is answered by the Pūrvamīmāṁsā system by formulating the theory of śakti (potential energy). Just as a seed possesses in it the imperceptible power with the help of which it can produce the sprout, so does the soul possess the power to manifest the results of Vedic rituals. These rituals, as soon as they are completed, generate in the soul that śakti or power. Since this power did not exist previously (a-pūrva = not existing previously) but is generated as a result of the rites, it is termed &#x2018;apūrva.&#x2019; This apūrva gets exhausted after producing its results.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Mīmāṁsā (also called Pūrva-mīmāṁsā) system of Hindu philosophy lays great emphasis on the performance of the rituals—which alone constitute the &#x2018;dharma&#x2019;—prescribed in the Vedas. The whole of the Vedas can be broadly divided into &#x2018;vidhi&#x2019; or injunctions and &#x2018;arthavāda&#x2019; or laudatory statements.</p>
			<p>The vidhis again are classified into three groups:</p> 
			<ol>
				<li>apūrva-vidhi;</li>
				<li>niyama-vidhi and</li>
				<li>parisaṅkhyā-vidhi.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The apūrva-vidhi (translated as &#x2018;original injunction&#x2019;) is a vidhi or injunction which has not been known previously (apūrva = unprecedented) To illustrate: In the Darśapūrṇamāsa sacrifice, there is the injunction, &#x2018;vrīhīn prokṣati&#x2019; (&#x2018;He sprinkles the rice grains&#x2019;). In the absence of this injunction the sprinkling with regard to the rice grains used in this sacrifice would never be known. But with this injunction, sprinkling of the rice grains becomes compulsory. Hence it is an original injunction.</p>

			<p>The fire in which Vedic sacrifices are performed, should be generated by attrition. The two pieces of wood used for this purpose are called &#x2018;araṇis.&#x2019; The lower piece, termed &#x2018;adharāraṇi,&#x2019; is rectangular in shape and has an indentation called &#x2018;devayoni,&#x2019; the origin of the god of fire. The upper piece called &#x2018;uttarāraṇi&#x2019; is in the form of a drill, which is inserted into the indentation of the adharāraṇi. Fire is generated by vigorous churning, to the chanting of appropriate ṛks (hymns from the <em>Ṛgveda</em>).</p>
			<p>There are several rules governing the preparation of these araṇis. The upper araṇi should be made from the wood of the śamī tree (<em>Prosopis specigera</em>) which is hard; and the lower one should be of the aśvattha (<em>Ficus religiosa</em>) which is softer, the size being 16 aṅgulas long, 12 aṅgulas wide and 4 aṅgulas in height.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>The lower araṇi is sometimes figuratively called the &#x2018;mother,&#x2019; the upper araṇi the father and agni the fire, as the offspring.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;forest treatises&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Each of the four Vedas, the basic scriptures of Hinduism, is generally divided into four parts: the Saṁhitā, the Brāhmaṇa, the Āraṇyaka and the Upaniṣad.</p>
			<p>The Saṁhitās are collections of Vedic hymns. The Brāhmaṇas are treatises written in prose, dealing with the conduct of sacrifices and other rites associated with them. The Upaniṣads deal with philosophical truths and esoteric wisdom.</p>
			<p>The Āraṇyakas form a link between the ritualism of the Brāhmaṇas and the philosophy of the Upaniṣads. Whether they really represent a transitional phase of thought, is difficult to decide since the Āraṇyakas and the Upaniṣads have almost fused into one another.</p>
			<p>Hindu tradition connects the four āśramas (stages of life) with the four divisions of the Vedas. The brahmacārin (student of the Vedas) is expected to memorise the Saṁhitā and know the application of the mantras contained therein, in the various rites and ceremonies. The gṛhastha (householder) is guided by the Brāhmaṇas in the performance of the numerous sacrificial rites. The vānaprasthin (forest recluse) is advised to contemplate on the ritual as symbolic of higher philosophic truths. The saṁnyāsin (monk) is to meditate upon the funda-mental spiritual truths until he directly perceives them.</p>
			<p>This traditional linking of the four āśramas with the four parts of the Vedas can perhaps give us an idea about the basis of the Āraṇyaka thought. Due to the physical infirmity brought on by old age and since the accessories and articles needed for the Vedic rites are not easily procurable in the forest, the vānaprasthin will be hard put to continue them. Moreover, battling with the various vicissi-tudes of life, will have brought on enough mellowness and wisdom that will make him receptive to philosophic speculations. However, the attachment to the rites and the eagerness to reap the promised fruits will still be lingering in the mind due to the long association with the deep involvement in those rites. Hence contemplation on the various aspects and stages of those rites as symbols of cosmic truths will be the best exercise for him, conducive to his ultimate spiritual welfare. This is exactly what the Āraṇyakas have done. In fact, the famous <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> begins with one such contemplation. Hence they are often classified as &#x2018;Upāsanākāṇḍa&#x2019; (section dealing with meditations) as opposed to the &#x2018;Karmakāṇḍa&#x2019; (section dealing with the rituals, i.e., Saṁhitās and Brāhmaṇas) and leading progressively to &#x2018;Jñānakāṇḍa&#x2019; (section dealing with spiritual knowledge, viz., the Upaniṣads).</p>
			<p>The extant Āraṇyakas of the four Vedas may be listed as follows:</p>
			<h3>Ṛgveda:</h3>
			<p><em>Aitareya Āraṇyaka, Śāṅkhyana Āraṇ-yaka</em> (sometimes called <em>Kauṣītaki Āraṇ-yaka</em> also).</p>
			<h3>Śukla Yajurveda:</h3>
			<p><em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> (the earlier part of the <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em>, the later part being the Upaniṣad).</p>
			<h3>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda:</h3>
			<p><em>Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, Maitrāyaṇīya Āraṇyaka</em>.</p>
			<h3>Sāmaveda:</h3>
			<p>Last part of the <em>Tāṇḍya-mahā-brāhmaṇa</em> (also known as <em>Pañcaviṁśa-brāhmaṇa</em>),<em> Talavakāra Āraṇyaka</em>.</p>
			<h3>Atharvaveda:</h3>

			<p>Festivals and sacred days break the monotony and add zest and colour to the life of the common people. Out of the several festivals of the Hindus, Araṇyaṣaṣṭhī (also called Āraṇyaṣaṣṭhi, Araṇya-gaurī-vrata or Skandaṣaṣṭhī) is perhaps a minor one. Celebrated on the sixth day of the bright half of the month of Jyeṣṭha (around June), it is mainly centred round the worship of Ṣaṣṭhī, the mother of Skanda (also known as Subrahmaṇya and Kārttikeya). Since she is the protectress of children, mothers propitiate her for the well-being of their children. Fasting or subsisting on lotus stalks, bulbous roots and fruits is pre-scribed as a discipline. It is usually performed in a wood or forest outside the village. Hence the name Araṇyaṣaṣṭhī (araṇya = forest). In some parts of India, sons-in-law are invited and entertained with a feast and clothes, thus giving the festival another name, viz., jāmātṛṣaṣṭhī (jāmātṛ = son-in-law).</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Vaiṣṇavite scriptures which preach the cult of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa-Kṛṣṇa put forth the theory that the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu has four kinds of manifestations:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the &#x2018;para&#x2019; or the Supreme;</li>
				<li>the &#x2018;vyūha&#x2019; or the emanation;</li>
				<li>the &#x2018;vibhava&#x2019; or the incarnation and</li>
				<li>the &#x2018;arcā&#x2019; or the icon.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Out of these, the arcā represents the images or icons installed and worshipped ceremonially in temples and shrines. Such icons are classified into four groups: svayaṁvyakta or self-manifested, daiva or established by gods, ārṣa or consecrated by the ṛṣis (sages) and mānuṣa or prepared by human beings.</p>
			<p>Even the man-made images, though prepared out of inanimate substances, can become &#x2018;alive&#x2019; if they are duly consecrated through the prescribed rites. God who is omnipotent &#x2018;descends&#x2019; into such images with a subtle body. This is the &#x2018;arcāvatāra&#x2019; or incarnation for purposes of ordinary worship.</p>

			<p>Sin (pāpa) and its expiation (prāya-ścitta) is one of the topics discussed by the dharmaśāstras, often in great detail. Many of the expiatory rites have been given the general name &#x2018;kṛcchra&#x2019; (&#x2018;that which cuts happiness or causes suffering). Out of the several kṛcchras, the &#x2018;ardha-kṛcchra&#x2019; is an expiation for minor sins and causes only &#x2019;half&#x2018; the suffering of a kṛcchra (ardha = half).</p>
			<p>The repentant transgressor is expec-ted to subsist on food obtained without asking for it, for the first three days and thereafter fast completely for three more days.</p>
			<p>As per another rule, he should eat only once in a day for two days, subsist on food got unasked for two more days and fast completely for the last two days of the six day discipline.</p>

			<p>The most important part of a Hindu temple is the garbhagṛha (<em>sanctum sanctorum</em>) wherein is housed the idol of the deity. In front of it and contiguous to it is the mukhamaṇḍapa, also called śukanāsī and ardhamaṇḍapa. This is actually a passage, its proportion being relative to that of the garbhagṛha itself. Apart from being used as a passage it is also used to keep the articles of worship including food offerings on special occasions. The word is sometimes spelt as &#x2018;ardhamanṭapa&#x2019; also.</p>

			<p>Śiva, also called Īśvara, is the third deity of the Hindu Trinity. He is generally worshipped in the form of the liṅga.</p>
			<p>Etymologically both the words, Śiva and liṅga, mean &#x2018;that into which the universe dissolves&#x2019;. Śiva is thus the ultimate source of all creation.</p>
			<p>In the Hindu mythological works, the śakti or power by which God creates, sustains and dissolves the universe is pictured as a female deity, the consort of God. Śiva&#x2019;s consort is Pārvatī.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Ardhanārīśvara is one of the several forms in which Śiva manifested himself. The right half is that of Śiva and the left, that of Pārvatī. This iconographic concept signifies the identity of Śiva and Śakti, and as a corollary, that man and woman are mutually complementary. In a more general sense, it signifies the bipolar nature of the world.</p>
			<p>Some scholars opine that the form might have been evolved to bring about a compromise between the cults of Śiva and Śakti.</p>

It signifies a reception ceremony performed in honour of a bridegroom by his father-in-law, of a newly married couple, on their return to the bride&#x2019;s house. It is usual to offer madhuparka (a mixture of honey and other ingredients) on such occasions.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;arghya&#x2019; derived from &#x2018;argha&#x2019; means a person worthy of &#x2018;argha&#x2019; or honour. However, it is used in a more restricted sense to indicate the water perfumed with flowers and mixed with dūrva-grass, rice grains and mustard seeds that is ceremonially offered in ritualistic worship of God, as also to honoured guests. They are expected to receive it and wash their hands with it.</p>
			<p>Six persons are enumerated as deserving this arghya: ācārya (teacher), ṛtvij (officiating priest), rājan (king), priya (friend), snātaka (Vedic student who has completed his studies) and vivāhya (bridegroom).</p>
			<p>In the sandhyā ritual, arghya is the offering of water to the sun. The worshipper takes water in the joined palms of his hands, repeats the Gāyatrī mantra over it and casts it up respectfully while standing and facing the sun. It is interest-ing to note that the use of dust is allowed for this purpose when water is not readily available.</p>

			<p>The Arhats (also spelt as Arahats or Arahantas) are beings who have become perfect and can teach the way to perfection to others. They are endowed with un-limited knowledge, vision, power and bliss.

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hinduism has always considered mokṣa or liberation from transmigratory existence, as the real and the ultimate goal of life. Since this is got by realising the ātman—one&#x2019;s true Self—already present in everyone, but covered over by various impurities of the mind, it is first necessary to efface them.</p>
			<p>These impurities of mind, which act as &#x2018;ari&#x2019; or an enemy in the path of spiritual evolution, are generally classed into six varieties and are called &#x2018;ariṣaḍvarga&#x2019;, the group of six enemies. They are: kāma (lust); krodha (anger); lobha (avarice); moha (delusion); mada (arrogance) and, mātsarya (jealousy).</p>
			<p>Some of the treatises of Vedānta like the <em>Jīvanmuktiviveka</em> of Vidyāraṇya (14th century A. D.) deal with the methods of eradicating them.</p>
			<p>According to the teachers of bhakti or devotion, these six passions can be eliminated by nāmajapa (repetition of the divine name) and upāsanā (meditation on God) or sublimated by directing them towards God Himself !</p>

			<p>Whether Sikhism is a separate reli-gion or a reform movement in Hinduism, there is no gainsaying the fact that the Sikh Gurus saved Hinduism from external as well as internal dangers and exercised a tremendous influence on the contemporary Hindu society.</p>
			<p>Sikhism, founded by Guru Nānak (A.D. 1469—1538) and nurtured by a succession of nine more Gurus, had to pass through various critical periods in its chequered history. Guru Arjan, the fifth in the line of succession, appeared on the scene just when a serious crisis, which would threaten its very existence, was developing.</p>
			<p>He was born at Goindwal in A.D. 1563. He was the youngest son of Bhāi Jeṭha (later ordained as Guru Rām Dās) and Bībi Bhani (daughter of the third Guru Amar Dās). Guru Amar Dās is said to have remarked that this child would cruise people across the ocean of life.</p>
			<p>Guru Rām Dās, in course of time, appointed Arjan as his successor. After his passing away, when Arjan took over as the next Guru, Prīti Cand, his eldest brother, who had not reconciled himself to this supersession, started harassing him to the maximum possible extent. However, being too humble and noble to counter him, Guru Arjan left Goindwal and settled down in a new township. Here he kept himself busy completing the holy tanks of Santokhsar and Amritsar and other works left unfinished by Guru Rām Dās. It was he who got the foundation stone of Harmandir (later known as the Golden Temple) laid by Mian Mīr, a Muslim saint from Lahore. After the construction of the temple and the lake was over, he undertook an extensive tour of Punjab to meet his disciples and consolidate the work.</p>
			<p>Guru Arjan, who had no children till then, sent his wife to Bhāi Buddha, a highly respected Sikh saint, to get his blessings. Bhāi Buddha blessed her and foretold that the son she would give birth to, would crush the enemies of Sikhism like crushing an onion. She gave birth to Hargobind, (in A. D. 1595), who later on succeeded Guru Arjan.</p>
			<p>Prīti Chand&#x2019;s machinations to usurp power continued. He organized several attempts to kill the child Hargobind who escaped miraculously. However, when he tried to bring out his own compositions, passing them on to the Sikhs as the compositions of Nānak, Guru Arjan had to act quickly and decisively. He personally went to all the important places connected with the previous Gurus and collected the authentic texts of their Bāṇi (word). This collection subsequently came to be known as the <em>Holy Granth</em>.</p>
			<p>Chandu Shāh, a Hindu banker of Delhi who wielded a lot of influence with the Mughal Emperors, was looking for a suitable match for his daughter. When his agents suggested that he marry her to Hargobind, Chandu Shāh pooh-poohed it deriding the Sikh Guru for lack of social or political status. Later on, when he could not get anyone else, and relented, Guru Arjan politely declined the offer. This antagonized the influential banker who succeeded in creating troubles for the Guru at the hands of the Mughal authorities.</p>
			<p>Though Akbar himself was well-disposed towards the Guru, Jehāṅgīr, his successor was not. He levied a heavy fine on the Guru who however refused to pay it. This incurred the wrath of the emperor who tortured him in various ways. The Guru however, bore everything with great fortitude. Later (in A. D. 1606) he entered the river Ravi and was carried away by its swirling waters.</p>
			<p>Guru Arjan has left a large number of hymns (2218) rich in imagery and lending themselves easily to music. <em>Sukhmaṇi</em>, his <em>magnum opus</em> ranks only next to the <em>Japji</em> of Guru Nānak.</p>

			<p>The most widely known of the five Pāṇḍava princes, the great hero of the Kurukṣetra war and the instrumental cause of the immortal <em> Bhagavadgītā</em>, Arjuna occupies a very important place in the epic <em>Mahābhārata</em>. Born to Kuntī, the senior queen of the King Pāṇḍu, by the grace of the god Indra, Arjuna exhibited his valour and skill in archery even from his childhood days, thus becoming the most favourite disciple of Droṇācārya, the superb master of the science of archery. Bent upon settling scores with the King Drupada, who had humiliated him, Droṇācārya sought Arjuna&#x2019;s help in humbling the king&#x2019;s pride. Arjuna responded enthusiastically and fulfilled his guru&#x2019;s wish. Later, disguised as a brāhmaṇa, Arjuna successfully pierced the matsya-yantra (a contrivance for testing the skill in archery) and won the hand of Draupadī, Drupada&#x2019;s daughter. However, a curious interference of fate made Draupadī, the common wife of all the Pāṇḍava princes. Apart from Draupadī, Arjuna had three more wives: Subhadrā, Ulūpī and Citrāṅgadā.</p>
			<p>Once he performed severe penance at the Indrakīla mountains to propitiate Lord Śiva. Śiva however appeared in the guise of a hunter chieftain and man-oeuvred a situation in which Arjuna was obliged to fight him! Of course Śiva was pleased with his courage and prowess, and granted him the celestial weapon pāśupatāstra.</p>
			<p>Living in disguise under the assumed name Bṛhannalā at the court of the king Virāṭa, he taught dancing to Virāṭa&#x2019;s daughter, Uttarā. Later he participated in the operation to rescue Virāṭa&#x2019;s cows from the clutches of the Kauravas, who were decisively beaten in the battle.</p>
			<p>Before the Kurukṣetra war, he approached Śrī Kṛṣṇa for help and preferred him (as his charioteer) to the Yādava army without Kṛṣṇa.</p>
			<p>At the commencement of the war, he was overcome by intense remorse and abhorrence of the killing involved, and refused to fight. After Śrī Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s teaching (known as the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>) dispelled his ignorance and delusion, he got up and fought, bringing ultimate victory and glory to the Pāṇḍavas.</p>
			<p>After Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s demise, he went to Dvārakā and while escorting the Yādava ladies to Hastināvatī, was ambushed and conquered by robbers, thereby obliging him to realize that all his strength had been derived from Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s grace! He died during the Mahāprasthāna (great journey), while ascending to heaven.</p>
			<p>Among his children, Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadrā, was slain in the Kuru-kṣetra war. Babhruvāhana, the son of Citrāṅgadā became the ruler of Maṇipura. Parīkṣit, the son of Abhimanyu, succeeded to the royal throne after its abdication by Yudhiṣṭhira.</p>
			<p>Kārtavīrya, the king of Haihaya, who was reputed to have one thousand arms, was also known as Arjuna. (See <ref>KĀRTAVĪRYĀRJUNA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>The well-known Buddhist work Lalitavistara mentions one mathematician Arjuna who was aware of the system of calculating numerals in multiples of 100, commencing from koṭi (one crore), up to 10<sup>53</sup>.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Indian epistemology recognizes intuition as a valid source of knowledge. Though normally the mind acquires know-ledge through the medium of the organs of perception, it can do so even without them, under certain conditions. Being next to the ātman (the soul) and capable of reflecting its glory, mind has infinite potential for knowledge. This potential is unfolded through spiritual disciplines.</p>
			<p>In the case of the ṛṣis or sages, the power of the mind blossoms forth due to learning, austerity and meditation. Through such a mind they can intuit anything they wish to know. Such know-ledge as acquired through the intuition of these sages is called &#x2018;ārṣajñāna.&#x2019; It is also called &#x2018;prātibha-jñāna&#x2019; (intuitive know-ledge) and is often equated with &#x2018;yogi-pratyakṣa&#x2019; (yogic intuition).</p>
			<p>Knowledge obtained in this way is distinct and vivid, and is free from doubts or illusions. It always agrees with facts.</p>

			<p>Śivaliṅga is one of the most ancient symbols of God that is still being worshipped in India. Liṅgas have been discovered in other countries also, especi-ally in Mexico and South East Asia.</p>
			<p>Out of the two types of liṅgas, the cala (the movable) and the acala or the sthāvara (the immovable), the latter is classified under nine heads. The &#x2018;ārṣa-liṅga&#x2019; is one among them. It is defined as the liṅga set up and worshipped by ṛṣis or sages. Ārṣa-liṅgas are usually spheroidal in shape, resembling an unhusked coconut fruit, and do not have the brahma-sūtra mark on them.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu religion has accorded vivāha or marriage the status of a &#x2018;saṁskāra,&#x2019; a sacrament that purifies the embodied soul in its journey towards perfection. Generally eight forms of marriage are described, out of which the &#x2018;ārṣa&#x2019; (derived from the ṛṣis or sanctioned by the Vedas) is the third. In this form of marriage, the father of the bride gifts her away to a suitable man after accepting one or two pairs of cattle (cow, bull) as a gift, to fulfil the law and not as a sale of the girl. The kanyādāna (gifting of the maiden) is done in a ceremonial way.</p>

			<p>It is a matter of common experience that a person turns towards God for succour when he is in trouble and when he discovers that he cannot expect relief from human efforts alone. Diseases, accidents or danger posed to life in critical situations make a man cry piteously to God to come to his rescue. Such a person is called an &#x2018;ārta&#x2019; and his devotion to God is classified as &#x2018;ārtabhakti,&#x2019; &#x2018;devotion of the afflicted&#x2019; (<em>vide Bhagavadgītā</em> 7.16).</p>
			<p>Hindu mythological lore abounds in instances of such ārtabhakti: Gajendra, the elephant king, praying for release from the clutches of the crocodile; Draupadī, when molested by Duśśāsana, crying to Kṛṣṇa for help; Mārkaṇḍeya appealing to Śiva to protect him from Yama, the god of death.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;that which is desired&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The ṛṣis (sages) of yore had recognized the innate human desire for enjoying the pleasures of life and had provided for it in the scheme of &#x2018;puruṣārthas&#x2019; prescribed for human beings. The four &#x2018;puruṣārthas&#x2019; (dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa) or ends to be striven for in human life, have given &#x2018;artha,&#x2019; acquisition of wealth and other objects of enjoyment, a very important place. However, this &#x2018;artha&#x2019; should be within the perimeters permitted by &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; or righteousness as defined by the holy scriptures and practised by sages.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;artha&#x2019; is commonly interpreted as &#x2018;meaning,&#x2019; meaning of words, phrases and sentences. According to works on rhetoric, the &#x2018;artha&#x2019; of a word can be of three types: vācyārtha (direct meaning), lakṣyārtha (implied meaning) and vyaṅgyārtha (alluded meaning).</p>
			<p>The first is illustrated by the sentence &#x2018;gām ānaya,&#x2019; (&#x2018;Bring the cow&#x2019;); the second, by &#x2018;kaliṅgaḥ sāhasikaḥ,&#x2019; (&#x2018;the Kaliṅga is adventurous&#x2019;) where, though the word &#x2018;Kaliṅga&#x2019; literally stands for the country, is interpreted by implication, to mean a citizen of that country. In the sentence &#x2018;saśaṅkha-cakro hariḥ,&#x2019; (&#x2018;Hari is with śaṅkha and cakra&#x2019;) though the word hariḥ has several meanings like Viṣṇu, Yama, Vāyu, lion and monkey, it is confined to Viṣṇu only, due to the allusion to śaṅkha (conch) and cakra (discus), which he alone holds. That is the example for the third type.</p>
			<p>In epistemology, &#x2018;artha&#x2019; stands for the objects apprehended by the sense-organs.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Buddha denied permanent reality to anything that is perceived in this world. Later Buddhist philosophers developed this into a regular school called &#x2018;kṣaṇika-vāda&#x2019; or theory of momentariness (kṣaṇa = moment).</p>
			<p>According to this theory, the criterion for the existence of a thing is its capacity to produce (kāritva) a useful effect (artha-kriyā). From this criterion of existence, it may be deduced that a thing having existence must be momentary. If, for example, an object like a seed be not accepted to be momentary, but thought to be lasting for more than one moment, then we have to show that it is capable of producing an effect during the each moment it exists. Since it does not, we conclude that it exists only for a moment.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the five truths&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Śrīvaiṣṇavism is the religion of the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta Darśana, the school of Vedānta systematized by Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) and his followers. It prescribes the knowledge of &#x2018;arthapañcaka&#x2019; or five truths, as very necessary in sādhana or spiritual practice. These five truths equip the sādhaka or the mumukṣu (the spiritual aspirant of emancipation) with the correct perspective derived from the philosophy of sādhanā.</p>
			<p>They are: prāpya (that which is to be obtained viz., Īśvara or God), prāptṛ (one who obtains, the jīva or the individual soul), upāya (the means of achieving God), prāptivirodhi (that which obstructs attainment of God) and prāpti (attaining the highest, i.e., God). The aspirant is expected to know the &#x2018;svarūpa&#x2019; or nature of all these five truths.</p>
			<p>These five are sometimes described as parasvarūpa (nature of the highest), svasvarūpa (nature of the self), upāya-svarūpa, virodhisvarūpa and puruṣārtha-svarūpa (nature of the ends of human endeavour) also.</p>
			<p>God who is &#x2018;para&#x2019; and &#x2018;prāpya&#x2019; can manifest himself in five forms as para (the highest form in Vaikuṇṭha), vyūhas (emanations like Saṅkarṣaṇa), vibhava (incarnations like Rāma), arcā (icons of worship) and antaryāmin (the indwelling spirit).</p>
			<p>The jīvas (individual souls) who are prāptṛ, have been divided into five groups viz., nityas (the eternally free), muktas (the liberated), baddhas (the bound), kevalas (the self-realized souls) and mumukṣus (those desirous of liberation).</p>
			<p>The well-known yogas of jñāna and bhakti as also prapatti (surrender to and dependence on the grace of God) and ācāryābhimāna (surrender to and faith in the preceptor) are the upāyas recommended.</p>
			<p>Identification of the body with the soul due to ignorance, disbelief in divine incarnations, pursuit of worldly pleasures to the exclusion of divine grace, doing things which will offend God, insulting devotees of God—these are some of the obstacles listed under &#x2018;prāptivirodhi.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Prāpti in the highest sense means living with God in the world of Vaikuṇṭha in eternal service to Him.</p>
			<p><em>Arthapañcaka</em> is also the title of a famous work in Tamil by Piḷḷai Lokācārya (A. D. 1264—1327), the founder of the Teṅgalai or the Southern school of the Śrīvaiṣṇava movement.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The darśanas or Indian philosophical systems have bestowed considerable attention on the methods of obtaining know-ledge. Means of such knowledge vary from three to six. It is the Pūrva-mīmāṁsā system that accepts and describes six such means, which by the way, form the maximum of such series.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Arthāpatti&#x2019; or &#x2018;postulation&#x2019; is the penultimate in this series. It is described as the necessary supposition of an un-perceived fact which <em>alone</em> can explain a phenomenon that demands an explanation. Suppose it is observed that a man is fasting during the day and yet is growing fat. It is impossible to reconcile these two facts—fatness and fasting—unless we admit that he eats at night! This postulation is &#x2018;arthāpatti.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The Mīmāṁsakas and Advaitins maintain that this is a distinctive source of knowledge whereas others include it under &#x2018;anumāna&#x2019; or inference.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hinduism has accorded &#x2018;artha&#x2019; or wealth (which also includes power), which is the most important means of enjoyment in this world, the status of a &#x2018;puruṣārtha,&#x2019; one of the four values to be striven for in life. Acquisition and enjoyment of wealth are impossible unless there is enough social security and peace. This is guaranteed only when there is a strong and just head of the State. Hence, statecraft becomes an extremely important branch of knowledge and a highly specia-lized discipline.</p>
			<p>Speculations on this subject have been traced to the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. Śaunaka&#x2019;s <em>Caraṇavyūha</em> lists &#x2018;Arthaśāstra&#x2019; as an Upaveda of <em>Atharvaveda</em>. The epics and the dharmaśāstra literature have given abundant material on it. There is reason to believe that four distinct schools and thirteen teachers of Arthaśāstra had existed before the 4th century B. C. However the loss of this fairly extensive literature is to be attributed to its supersession by the masterly treatise of Kauṭilya, which itself was recovered from oblivion by the providential discovery of a complete manuscript and its publication with an English translation by R. Shama Sastry of Mysore in 1908.</p>
			<p>This <em>Arthaśāstra</em> of Kauṭilya has been assigned to the period 321—300 B. C. and the authorship attributed to Viṣṇugupta-Cāṇakya, nicknamed &#x2018;Kauṭilya&#x2019; (&#x2018;the crafty&#x2019;), the renowned preceptor of the emperor Candragupta Maurya. Not much is known of his life. Hailing from a place called Caṇaka—hence the appellation Cāṇakya to him—near Takṣaśilā (near Peshawar, Pakistan), he was well-versed in the Vedic lore and had remained a celibate for life. Endowed with a keen intellect, tremendous will-power and pride, he is said to have been once insulted by Mahāpadma Nanda, the monarch of Magadha. Furious at this humiliation, he swore vengeance on the Nanda dynasty and left Pāṭalīputra, the capital of Magadha. Having spotted Candragupta, the son of Murā by Mahāpadma Nanda, as the worthy candidate for the throne, he trained him for the high responsibility. He seized the throne in 321 B. C. and installed Candragupta as the King. Later, he inspired Candragupta to drive away the Greek invaders, build and consolidate the first empire known to recorded Indian history. He later contrived to bring back Rākṣasa, the premier of the Nandas as the prime minister, and retired into solitude for a contemplative life.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Kauṭilya&#x2019; is sometimes spelt as &#x2018;Kauṭalya&#x2019; and defined as a &#x2018;descendent of the gotra Kuṭala,&#x2019; probably to avoid the odium of the literal meaning. Many scholars do not subscribe to this view.</p>
			<p>The <em>Arthaśāstra</em> comprises 6000 ślokas (stanzas of 32 letters) divided into 15 adhikaraṇas or sections and dealing with 180 prakaraṇas or topics. The first part consisting of adhikaraṇas 1 to 5 is called &#x2018;Tantra&#x2019; and deals with the topic of providing security and prosperity to the people by the king. The second part (adhikaraṇas 6—13) is termed &#x2018;Āvāpa&#x2019; and concerns itself with keeping watch over the neighbouring rulers. The third and the last part (adhikaraṇas 14 and 15) treats of whatever is left over and hence christened &#x2018;Śeṣa.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The contents of the various adhi-karaṇas may be briefly summarized as follows:</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 1</strong> (18 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>The education and discipline of the king, qualifications and testing of ministers, institution of spies, ambassadors, protection of princes and harem, king&#x2019;s personal safety.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 2</strong> (38 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Superintendents of the various departments of the State, founding of villages, building forts, afforestation, commissioners for revenue from various departments, duties of the accountant-general, prevention of and punishment for embezzlement of public funds, building up the treasury.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 3</strong> (19 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Administration of justice, forms of marriage, duties of married couples and allied topics.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 4</strong> (13 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Protection of merchants, artisans and others, remedies and relief during national calamities, suppression of and punishment for crime, protection to the various departments of the State.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 5</strong> (7 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Conduct of courtiers, punishment for treason, replenishing treasury in emergencies.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 6</strong> (2 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Constitution of the maṇḍala (group of kings), seven elements of sovereignty, qualities of a king, sixfold royal policy, threefold śakti.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 7</strong> (29 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Six possible causes of action like peace, war, neutrality, alliance etc.; conduct of a mediatory king and a neutral king.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 8</strong> (8 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Vyasanas (vices and misfortunes) of the several elements of sovereignty, troubles of the king and kingdom.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 9</strong> (12 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Organizing invasions.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 10</strong> (13 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>About war.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 11</strong> (2 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>On corporations and guilds.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 12</strong> (9 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>How to deal with a powerful enemy through envoys, intrigues, spies and stratagems.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 13</strong> (6 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Ways to capture the fort of an enemy, entice him, and restore peace in the conquered territory.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 14</strong> (3 prakaraṇas)</h1>
			<p>Secret recipes for eliminating or incapacitating the enemy.</p>
			<h1><strong>Adh. 15</strong> (1 prakaraṇa)</h1>
			<p>Appendix of the plan of this work, illustrating the methodological principles.</p>
			<p>The work shows clearly that Kauṭilya was a master in various branches of sciences and a social reformer endowed with robust commonsense and practical wisdom. His views on divorce, remarriage of widows and wives under certain conditions, stressing the life here and now as important, his lenience towards certain human weaknesses like gambling are, by any standards, revolutionary. Scholars like P. V. Kane opine that the <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em> is a later composition and has borrowed liberally from Kauṭilya&#x2019;s work.</p>
			<p>Two commentaries on the work by Bhaṭṭasvāmin and Mādhavayajvan, have been discovered. But both are fragmentary.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;statement of meaning&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Out of the six systems of Indian philosophy accepting the authority of the Vedas, the Pūrva Mīmāṁsā has devoted itself exclusively to the methods of correct interpretation of the Vedic texts. It divides the entire Veda into two parts: vidhi or injunction, and arthavāda or statements explaining or reiterating certain facts already known through other means.</p>
			<p>Vidhi refers to supramundane affairs and has to be understood literally. In contrast to this arthavāda relates to matters of ordinary experience and hence carries with it no logical significance. Its main purpose is to make us do certain good things by praising them or reject bad ones by censuring them. Hence it should never be taken literally. For instance when it is stated that &#x2018;the sacrificial post is the sun,&#x2019; it simply means that the post is bright like the sun and is intended to commend the sacrifice in the performance of which, the post is used.</p>
			<p>Arthavāda is of three types: guṇa-vāda, anuvāda and bhūtārthavāda. When a statement is contradicted by another means of proof—as for instance, in the sentence already quoted, direct perception contradicts the post being the sun—it has to be interpreted by considering the statement as gauṇa or secondary, the primary sense conveyed being brightness. Such an arthavāda is called guṇavāda.</p>
			<p>When the stated meaning has already been established by other means of know-ledge as in &#x2018;Fire is an antidote of cold,&#x2019; wherein the fact stated is a matter of direct experience, the statement itself is to be considered as an anuvāda, a reitera-tion of a fact already established.</p>
			<p>In bhūtārthavāda, an occurence which happened in the past (bhūta = past) is stated. Since it can neither be confirmed nor denied, it has to be accepted as it is. For instance, a statement such as &#x2018;Indra raised his thunderbolt to strike at Vṛtra&#x2019; has got to be accepted at its face value since there is no way of proving or disproving it.</p>
			<p>According to another classification, arthavāda is of four kinds: nindā (censure), stuti (eulogy), parakṛti (performance by another great person) and purākalpa (what happened in bygone ages).</p>
			<p>The first is meant to prevent certain acts and the second to impel doing certain others. The third is also meant to praise certain acts and induce us to do them. The last demonstrates something that has been narrated by another as having taken place in the past.</p>

			<p>Śaivism, centred round the worship of Śiva, is a very ancient religious cult of India. Śaivasiddhānta, also known as Tamil Śaivism, is an important contribution to the Śaiva lore of South India. Its basic canonical works were composed by Meykaṇdār, Aruḷnandi (also spelt as Aruṇandi), Jñāna Sambandhar and Umāpati, all of whom lived during the period 13th—14th centuries. These four have been designated as &#x2018;Sanātana Ācāryas&#x2019; or ancient teachers.</p>
			<p>Aruḷnandi was the family preceptor of the young Meykaṇḍār. The story goes that puffed up with vanity, he once asked his pupil Meykaṇḍār about the nature of ignorance. Meykaṇḍār, the young saint simply looked at the proud questioner himself as if in reply. The teacher immedi-ately realized that he himself had been pointed out as a specimen of ignorance, and, overcome by shame, became a disciple of the young saint, assuming the name Aruḷnandi Śivācāriār.</p>
			<p>He has written a commentary called <em>Śivajñānasiddhi</em> on Meykaṇḍār&#x2019;s basic work <em>Śivajñānabodha</em> which itself is in twelve sūtras or aphorisms. This work is in two parts, the first, &#x2018;Parapakkam,&#x2019; refuting other schools of philosophy and the second, &#x2018;Supakkam,&#x2019; expounding the fundamentals of his own school. The latter is in verse and is considered to be a commentary on Meykaṇḍār&#x2019;s work. Another work, <em>Irupāvirupabtu</em> is also attributed to Aruḷnandi.</p>

			<p>Aruṇa, the charioteer of Sūrya, the Sun-god, was the first son of the sage Kaśyapa and Vinatā. Since her pregnancy lasted too long, Vinatā impatiently pressed her womb, resulting in the deformity of limbs to the unborn child. So, Aruṇa was born without thighs. (Hence the name anūru, one without thighs.) He was appointed by the gods as the charioteer of Sūrya. He is red in colour and imparts his hue to the sky as he drives in the chariot.</p>
			<p>Garuḍa, the famous mount of Viṣṇu, is his younger brother. Sampāti and Jaṭāyu the two giant birds mentioned in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> are his sons.</p>
			<p>Aruṇa is also the name of a demon killed by the goddess Durgā, in her aspect as Bhramarāmbā.</p>

			<p>A work, <em>Tiruppugaḷ</em> containing soul-stirring hymns on Lord Muruga (Subrah-maṇya), is very popular in Tamil Nadu. The author Aruṇagirināthar, a Śaiva saint, lived in the 15th century. It is said that he had an infamous birth and led a riotous life in his youth. A simple remark from his own sister caused such an intense remorse that he tried to commit suicide by jumping from the high tower of the temple. However, God saved him in a miraculous way. Thenceforth he dedicated his life for God. Sublime poetry welled forth from his heart as a result of divine grace showered on him. Some other treatises are also attributed to him.</p>

			<p>Arundhatī, the famous wife of the famous sage Vasiṣṭha, is considered as the paragon of wifely virtues. She was the daughter of Prajāpati Kardama and Devahūti. Atri&#x2019;s wife Anasūyā was her sister and the sage Kapila, her brother. The ṛṣi Śakti was her son. She was as erudite as her husband and was an ācāryā (preceptor) in her own right.</p>
			<p>She is said to exist in the form of a nakṣatra or a star. The &#x2018;Arundhatī-nakṣatra&#x2019; is identified as the star Alcor, belonging to the Great Bear group.</p>
			<p>It is obligatory for newly married couples to see the Arundhatī nakṣatra. Since it is very dim and scarcely visible, the priest shows the brighter stars nearby and then gradually directs their eyes to the real Arundhatī. This is known as &#x2018;Arundhatī Darśana Nyāya&#x2019; or simply as &#x2018;Arundhatī Nyāya.&#x2019; It signifies the method of leading from the gross to the subtle, from the known to the unknown, in logic and philosophy.</p>
			<p>Arundhatī is also the name of a medicinal plant used to heal serious wounds.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Known also as &#x2018;Āruṇi-&#x2019; and &#x2018;Āruṇika-&#x2019; Upaniṣad, it is a minor work belonging to the <em>Sāmaveda</em>. It deals with saṁnyāsa or monastic life.</p>
			<p>The sage Āruṇi goes to the abode of Prajāpati (&#x2018;Lord of beings;&#x2019; same as Brahmā, the Creator) and asks Him how he can give up all actions. Prajāpati replies that he should give up his family and friends, the holy thread, the sacrificial system and the scriptures that advocate them and the desire for attaining any of the well-known worlds or planes of exis-tence. He should accept saṁnyāsa or monastic life. This is the first section.</p>
			<p>The next section clearly states that anyone, from any state of life, can take to the monastic life, intense spirit of renunciation being the only criterion. The process of ceremonially giving up the sacred thread (yajñopavīta) and the fires, and the exhortation to study the Āraṇyakas and Upaniṣads, follow next.</p>
			<p>The third section gives the well-known praiṣamantra, the sacred formula to be repeated thrice, signifying that the aspirant has totally renounced the three worlds. A Vedic prayer for protection, instructions regarding food, wearing of the loin-cloth and observance of disciplines like brahmacarya (chastity), ahiṁsā (non-injury) and satya (truthfulness) are given at the end.</p>
			<p>The fourth section deals with the conduct of &#x2018;paramahaṁsa-parivrājaka,&#x2019; the highest class of itinerant monks. They should sleep on the ground, use a bowl of clay, gourd or wood for water, give up lust, anger, avarice and other evil passions and constantly move about, all alone, except during the rainy season. (See <ref>CĀTURMĀSYA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>The last section describes the mode of begging, uttering the sacred &#x2018;Oṁ,&#x2019; and closes with a well-known Vedic prayer that describes the state of enlightenment of sages.</p>

			<p>Āruṇi, son of Aruṇa Aupaveśi, is one of the more important teachers mentioned in the Upaniṣads. When he was under-going training in Vedic studies, his guru Dhaumya once commanded him to stop the water that was leaking out of his fields. Āruṇi lay across the breach and stopped it. Hence, he came to be known as Uddālaka (&#x2018;One who bound or fastened the bund&#x2019;). Gautama is another appellation for him. Śvetaketu was his son.</p>
			<p>He once went to the king Pravāhaṇa Jaivali and was humble enough to learn about the <em>Pañcāgnividyā</em> or the &#x2018;doctrine of five fires&#x2019; from him.</p>
			<p>When he discovered that his son Śvetaketu was puffed up with pride after returning from his teacher&#x2019;s house, due to Vedic learning, he put him a fundamental question: &#x2018;Have you known that by knowing which, all the unknown becomes known?&#x2019; Since Śvetaketu did not know and requested him to teach it, Āruṇi taught him this esoteric wisdom.

			<p>Studies in Indian history and culture have revealed that India had excelled not only in the spiritual sciences but also in the secular sciences. The names and works of several eminent scholars whose fields of work have embraced several disciplines like medicine, surgery, mathematics, astro-nomy, astrology, politics, economics, dramatics, dance, music, fine-arts, architecture, chemistry, alchemy, archery etc., have been mentioned in the ancient and medieval works.</p>
			<p>Among these, Āryabhaṭa is one important name associated with mathematics and astronomy. Historians have discovered two Āryabhaṭas in their researches.</p>
			<p>Āryabhaṭa I (5th cent. A. D.) was an astronomer and mathematician who lived in Kusumapura (Pāṭalīputra). His work called <em>Āryasiddhānta</em> (laghu) is a concise work in four chapters. The first chapter (<em>Daśagītikā</em>) comprises of ten verses in the gītikā metre and is introductory. The second (<em>Gaṇitapāda</em>) deals with several aspects of mathematics. The third (<em>Kāla-kriyā</em>) is concerned with the reckoning of time and the last (&#x2018;gola&#x2019;) expatiates on astronomy.</p>
			<p>Aryabhaṭa II lived in the 10th cent. A. D. The work <em>Āryasiddhānta</em> is attributed to him. It is in 18 chapters and deals with arithmetic and algebra as also astronomy. <em>Mahābhāskarīya</em> seems to be another title for the same treatise.</p>

			<word>Āryans</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Did the Āryans originate in India or did they migrate from elsewhere? This question has been debated for over 150 years without arriving at any definite conclusions. If one group of scholars thinks that they migrated from Central Asia (near the Capsian Sea) others like Tilak opine that they lived near the Arctic region from where they trekked to southern Europe, Iran and India. Quite a few others have endeavoured to prove that they originally lived in the Indo-Gangetic region itself. Recent French excavations at the Mehr-garh site near the Bolan Pass in Pakistan seem to confirm this view, taking the date of the Indus Valley Civilisation to 6500 B. C.</p>
			<p>However there is no doubt that the word &#x201c;ārya&#x201d; has been used widely to denote any cultured and refined person.</p>
			<p>Many interesting details about the life and culture of the Āryans can be gathered by a study of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. They lived primarily by agriculture and dairy farming. Though cattle were the chief domesticated animals, sheep, goats and horses were also their common possession. Yava (barley) was the chief food grain raised and used by them.</p>
			<p>Apart from milk, curds, ghee and flour, they used to consume soma juice and surā (liquor) also. Consumption of liquor was however condemned. Meat-eating was not uncommon.</p>
			<p>Apart from villages, they could build forts and towns also. They were good in constructing chariots as also ships, knew weaving of cloth as also tanning and preparing leather goods. They were fami-liar with various kinds of irrigation. Chariot race, hunting and gambling were common sources of recreation. Cows and goods were used as money. Later on, gold and silver coins came into existence.</p>
			<p>The father was the head of the family. Mother was however, highly respected. Marriage ties were considered very sacred. Women could choose their husbands. The wife had an important role to play in the performance of Vedic rites. Monogamy seems to have been the rule though poly-gamy was common among the kṣattriyas. Couples hankered after children, especially good sons. Widows had a share in their husbands&#x2019; property. Remarriage of widows was prevalent, though rare.</p>
			<p>People lived in groups, each group electing its own ruler or king. In course of time the office of the king became hereditary. The king would take guidance from the wise elders in administration. They would also employ purohits (priests) who exercised a great influence over the kings and the State. All religious activities were conducted and supervised by them. The kings would generously reward them. Performance of big sacrifices like Aśvamedha and Rājasūya by the more powerful kings was common.</p>
			<p>The caste system as we know it did not exist in the beginning. The division of the society into four varṇas was however, a recognised fact.</p>
			<p>Sanskrit, in its archaic form, was the language of the people.</p>
			<p>Religion of the Āryans (sometimes called Āryanism) consisted predominantly of yajñas and yāgas (sacrifices), which included animal sacrifices, performed mostly for worldly gains like longevity, wealth, progeny or a place in heaven. Belief in one God, as also several deities like Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa or Viṣṇu, often eulogized as the Supreme Deity or as manifestations of the one God, is seen in several of the mantras of the <em>Ṛgveda.</em> Temples and worship as we know them today do not seem to have existed then. Reckoning of time, especially for religious purposes, was done both with respect to the movement of the sun and the moon.</p>
			<p>The Āryans believed in life after death. In disposing of the dead bodies, both cremation and burial seem to have been in vogue. After death, the soul was believed to go to pitṛloka (world of manes) or svarga (heaven) or to hell.</p>
			<p>Modern Hinduism, both in its reli-gious and cultural aspect, retains quite a few of the Vedic customs, either in a pure or in a metamorphosed form.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Any religion and culture which gives freedom to its adherents for self-introspection and self-criticism naturally paves the way for rejuvenation and renaissance. Thanks to the immense freedom of thought and expression enjoyed by its adherents, Hinduism has passed through several phases of renaissance.</p>
			<p>The Āryasamāj founded by Svāmī Dayānanda Sarasvatī (A. D. 1824-1883) is one of the more important reform movements of Modern Hindu renaissance initiated during the 19th century. It came as a reaction to the two-way decline of the Hindu society, the first being the loss of faith in its own religion due to the impact of English education and Western culture; and the second being the devitalization brought about by the onslaughts of Islam and Christianity.</p>
			<p>It was formally established in 1875 with a creed of 28 principles which were later reduced to 10 in the revision brought about in 1877. Belief in Brahman the one God and in the infallibility of the Vedas is the central part of the creed. Since only the Vedas were accorded the highest place, much of the later Hindu thought, belief and ritualism were given the go by. Even the Upaniṣads and the <em>Gītā</em> were relegated to the background.</p>
			<p>However, the Āryasamāj fulfilled a very important and urgent need of the Hindu society by instituting the śuddhi movement (reconversion into Hinduism). A sizeable section of the Indian population which had become alienated from the Hindu religion and society due to historical and other factors, was reclaimed into the Hindu fold.</p>
			<p>By abolishing caste among its followers, investing all of them with the yajñopa-vīta (sacred thread) and giving the Gāyatrī mantra to them, Āryasamāj has helped in the consolidation of Hindu society, at least in those parts of India which have come under its influence. It also sponsored social reform by advocating remarriage of widows, abolition of child marriage and untouchability. It has done great service in the field of education and spread of Sanskrit language. Its sphere of influence was mostly confined to Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.</p>
			<p>The militant approach of the Āryasamāj created many enemies for it which resulted in the martyrdom of some of its leaders.</p>
			<p>Within ten years of its founder&#x2019;s death, the movement split into two, one group advocating modernism also and the other devoted to orthodoxy.</p>

			<p>The fourth month of the Hindu lunar calendar is called Āṣāḍha (June-July) when the full-moon is said to be near the constellation Āṣāḍhā. The ekādaśī (11th day) of the bright fortnight of this month is christened &#x2018;śayanī&#x2019; since it was believed that Lord Viṣṇu went to bed on this day, to wake up again on the ekādaśī of kārttika bright fortnight, called &#x2018;prabo-dhinī or bodhinī.&#x2019; The legend of Viṣṇu&#x2019;s going to bed for four months might be symbolic of the disappearance of the sun (who is also Viṣṇu) behind the clouds during the rainy season.</p>
			<p>The deity Subrahmaṇya (also known as Ṣaṇmukha and Skanda) is associated with this month. The sixth day of the bright fortnight called &#x2018;Skandaṣaṣṭhī&#x2019; is an important festival observed especially in South India.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Vaiśeṣika Darśana (a logical system of Indian philosophy attributed to the sage Kaṇāda) recognizes seven padārthas or categories of reality, out of which samavāya or the relation of inhe-rence forms the sixth. It is the eternal relationship that subsists between the whole and the parts, the quality or an action and the substance possessing or doing it and so on.</p>
			<p>Clay is the material cause for the jug. The two are inseparable. Hence, clay is called the samavāyi-kāraṇa, an inherent cause, of the jug. However, the colour of the jug is not caused by the clay, but by the colour of the clay which again exists in clay by samavāya. Hence, the colour of the clay is said to be the asamavāyi-kāraṇa, a non-inherent cause, of the colour of the jug.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Out of the Ṣaḍ-darśanas or six systems of Indian philosophy, that of Patañjali (200 B. C.) known as the <em>Yoga-sūtras</em>, is very popular since it gives highly practical methods of controlling the mind.</p>
			<p>When a systematic attempt is made to control and eliminate the vṛttis or modifications of the mind through the practice of the various steps of yoga such as yama and niyama, it will result in &#x2018;samādhi,&#x2019; total absorption in the object of contemplation.</p>
			<p>This samādhi is of two types: sam-prajñāta (cognitive) and asamprajñāta (ultra-cognitive). In the former, the object of contemplation will be vividly revealed. In this state, though all other mental modifications are eliminated, that of the object of contemplation continues to remain active. Hence in the strictest sense of the definition of &#x2018;yoga&#x2019; as &#x2018;cittavṛtti-nirodha&#x2019; (<em>Yogasūtras</em> 1.2) (&#x2018;suppression of modifications of mind&#x2019;) this samādhi indicates a lower state of yoga. As opposed to this, in the higher samādhi called asamprajñāta, <em>all</em> modifications of mind are eliminated, leaving only the saṁskāras (latent tendencies) behind. (<em>vide Yoga-sūtras</em> 1.18). In this state, it looks as though even the mind does not exist, since there are no mental modifications to reveal its presence.</p>
			<p>This samādhi is sometimes called &#x2018;nirbīja-samādhi&#x2019; (seedless samādhi) since the seeds of rebirth are eliminated as a result of this experience.</p>
			<p>Intense vairāgya (&#x2018;paravairāgya&#x2019;) or detachment is said to be the means of achieving this samādhi.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Though āsanas are a very popular mode of exercise, the word &#x2018;āsana&#x2019; has a much wider connotation and deeper signi-ficance. Patañjali, the great master of yoga, has listed āsana as the third of the eight steps of yoga. According to him, any posture in which the yogi can sit steadily and comfortably, is &#x2018;āsana.&#x2019; This āsana can be mastered through meditation on the infinite and by a relaxation of the body and mind. When this technique of āsana is perfected, the yogi acquires immunity from the effects of pairs of opposites like heat and cold, hunger and thirst, happiness and misery (<em>vide Yoga-sūtras</em> 2.46, 47 and 48). Out of the six āsanas that are recommended as suitable for meditation, padmāsana and svasti-kāsana are supposed to be the best.</p>
			<p>Āsanas as physical postures come under the purview of another branch of yoga, known as &#x2018;Haṭhyoga.&#x2019; These āsanas, it is claimed, can cure diseases, improve health and help in meditation. Though the typical posture of every living being can serve as a model for an āsana, only 84 āsanas are handed down in tradition as especially suitable for human beings. Out of these again, only 32 are more in vogue.</p>
			<p>Āsana can also mean a seat. Various kinds of seats have been recommended as suitable for meditation. Seats made of kuśa grass, deer-skin, tiger-skin, woollen rug or silk cloth have been mentioned in the works on yoga, along with the fruits one will get by using them.</p>

			<p>The Hindu temple is an ancient institution. The images that are installed inside the shrines or inscribed on the walls and the pillars should be prepared strictly according to the rules of &#x2018;mūrtiśilpaśāstra&#x2019; or iconography. Such mūrtis or images of gods and goddesses are generally divided into three kinds depending upon their posture: the sthānaka or standing, the āsana or sitting and the śayana or lying down.</p>
			<p>The āsanamūrtis again can be of various types depending on the particular āsana or posture adopted. At least twenty āsanas are mentioned in the iconographical works. To name a few: ālīḍha, kūrma, dhyāna, padma, paryaṅka, yoga, bhadra, vīra and svastika.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the theory of non-existent effect&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The relationship between a cause (like clay) and its effect (like the pot) has provided enough material for discussion in Indian philosophy. Several theories have been advocated in which this relationship has been sought to be explained. &#x2018;Asat-kārya-vāda&#x2019; is the theory that has been put forward by the schools of Buddhism and of Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas.</p>
			<p>When the pot, the effect, is produced from clay, its cause, two explanations are possible. The effect, which already existed in its cause in a subtle form, was mani-fested when favourable circumstances were created; because a real effect cannot be produced from an unreal or non-existing cause. This theory is called &#x2018;satkāryavāda&#x2019; and is advocated generally by the Sāṅkhya system. The other explanation is that the effect, which is something new, is produced as a result of the efforts of the potter and his implements, even though it did not exist earlier. If the clay and the pot were not different from each other, we should have used the same name for both and they should have served the same purpose. But this is not so. Hence according to this view, a real effect (&#x2018;kārya&#x2019;) is produced from the cause though it did not exist earlier (hence unreal or &#x2018;asat&#x2019;) in that cause. Therefore the name &#x2018;asatkārya-vāda.&#x2019;</p>

		<description>
			<p>Birth and death occurring in a Hindu family were believed to bring about aśauca (also spelt as āśauca) or ceremonial impu-rity not only on all its members but also on the near relatives. Though the dharma-śāstras have dealt with this subject in great detail, the exact reason, why such aśauca is to be observed, has not been clearly indicated.</p>
			<p>Aśauca at birth was called &#x2018;janmāśauca&#x2019; and that at death, &#x2018;mṛtāśauca.&#x2019; &#x2018;Sūtaka&#x2019; was another general term applied to both, but more for the latter than for the former.</p>
			<p>The period of aśauca varied from one month to one day, there being no unani-mity among the writers. Ten days, three days or one day seem to be more common. During these days of aśauca, the members of the family were practically treated as untouchables, and they temporarily lost their religious privileges. After the comple-tion of the period they were to bathe, change clothes and perform certain śāntis or propitiatory religious rites.</p>
			<p>People occupying important places in society, whose duties and works were essential for the general welfare of the community, were exempted from the obser-vance of aśauca: for instance, the doctor, the craftsman and so on. The king had the power to grant such exemptions to anyone, using his discretion.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hinduism believes in rebirth. The soul of any being, though immortal, continues to be born again and again due to its karma or the subtle unseen deserts. This goes on until it gets mokṣa or liberation from this cycle of births and deaths.</p>
			<p>It is this &#x2018;karma&#x2019; that has been called &#x2018;āśaya&#x2019; or &#x2018;karmāśaya&#x2019; by some scriptures like the <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (1.24; 2.12). It has been called &#x2018;āśaya&#x2019; since it &#x2018;rests in the mind&#x2019; (śaya = resting) &#x2018;until&#x2019; (ā = until) it fructifies. It is of the form of puṇya (merit) and pāpa (de-merit) and is generated by kāma (desire), lobha (greed), moha (delusion) and krodha (anger). Its results may be experienced either in this life itself or in future births.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu asceticism is a very ancient institution. Munis (men of contemplation) and yatis (men of self-control) are mentioned even in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. Tapas (auste-rity), vairāgya (detachment), tyāga (renunciation), brahmacarya (celibacy) are virtues extolled in the Vedic and Upaniṣadic literature. Saṁnyāsa (monastic life) as one of the four āśramas (stages of life) is well-known.</p>
			<p>Dissatisfaction with the worldly life, hope of finding eternal peace and faith in the state of liberation called mokṣa, must have prompted some people to take to the ascetic way of life as a means to their cherished goal. There is reason to believe that such ascetics existed in good numbers.</p>
			<p>Tapas (austerity including mortification of the flesh), brahmacarya (celibacy), jñāna and vidyā (learning) and yoga (contemplation and meditation) were the prescribed disciplines for the ascetics. They had to be assiduously cultivated.</p>
			<p>Modes of dress varied from stark nakedness to wearing ochre-coloured robes. Wearing just a kaupīnam (loin-cloth) or tattered garment picked up from the roadside was often commended. Other possessions permitted were: kamaṇḍalu (waterpot), pavitra (cloth used as strainer), daṇḍa (staff), pātra (vessel of gourd for food), śikya (loop of rope to carry the food-pot) and sometimes, a pair of tongs for tending fire.</p>
			<p>There were ascetics who lived alone and others who lived in groups, sometimes building monasteries for their stay and activities. Several orders of ascetics have been known to exist, such as saṁnyāsins (including the daśanāmis), bairāgis, kabīrpanthis and so on. Each of these orders had its own methods of initiation for the novices desiring to enter it.</p>
			<p>Though ascetic life was permissible only for the dvijas (&#x2018;twice-born&#x2019;) in the earlier days, later history of asceticism shows that people from all castes have taken to it.</p>
			<p>Women also could become ascetics though for obvious reasons, their number and orders were very much less.</p>

			<p>While discussing &#x2018;hetvābhāsa&#x2019; or fallacy of inference, the Nyāya system (Logical Theism of Gautama) lists five kinds of material fallacies of which &#x2018;asiddha&#x2019; forms the fourth. When it is said that &#x2018;the sky-lotus is fragrant, because it has lotusness in it, like a natural lotus,&#x2019; the pakṣa or the minor term viz., the &#x2018;sky-lotus&#x2019; has no <em>locus standi</em> (being only an ābhāsa or an appearance) and hence the syllogism becomes &#x2018;asiddha&#x2019; or unproved.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Vratas or religious vows are undertaken either as expiation for sins committed or as a selfimposed discipline to gain something in life which cannot normally be gained by human endeavours or even as a mark of thanksgiving to God when certain desires have been fulfilled. &#x2018;Asidhārā-vrata&#x2019; is one such vrata and is so called because it is as difficult as walking on the edge of a drawn sword. It begins on the full-moon day of Āśvina (September-October) and may be continued for five days, ten days, or four months or one year or even twelve years. During this vrata, one has to sleep on the bare ground, bathe outside the house, eat food only in the night, eschew anger and should observe strict celibacy eventhough sleeping with one&#x2019;s wife. During this period, gifts must be given to worthy persons. Sometimes a daṇḍa (stick) or even a sword is kept in between the person and his wife when they sleep in the night, as a reminder that they have to practise self-control and are observing a vow as difficult as walking on the edge of a sword.</p>
			<p>Many rewards have been promised to those who perform this vrata successfully.</p>

			<p>Asita (the dark one) also called Devala, was a sage well-versed in yoga. He was the elder brother of sage Dhaumya and an expert in sarpavidyā (science of snakes). Hence those afflicted with the fear of snakes are advised to remember him. Through his grace, they can overcome that fear. He is said to have become a disciple of Jaigīṣavya, who once visited his hermitage and exhibited his extra-ordinary powers. He is one of the sages through whom the <em>Mahābhārata</em> was spread among the people.</p>

			<p>It is usually classified as belonging to the rākṣasa group. Serpent is its presid-ing deity. It is considered as an evil nakṣatra so much so that if children are born in it, special śāntis or propitiatory rites like &#x2018;gomukha-prasava-śānti&#x2019; are prescribed to be performed to ward off its effects. Travelling is forbidden when this nakṣatra is in the ascendant.</p>

			<p>Among all the Hindu saṁskāras or sacraments, vivāha or marriage, has been given the central place. Unlike as in some other societies, marriage for a Hindu, is not a social contract but a spiritual sacrament and hence considered as perma-nent and indissoluble.</p>
			<p>Out of the several steps involved in the sacrament of marriage, aśmārohaṇa is also one. When the couple go round the nuptial fire three times—this is called agnipariṇayana or circumambulating the fire—the bridegroom makes the bride step upon a mill-stone each time, with certain mantras, the purport of which is that she should be firm and steady like the stone, in her marital life which is spiritual companionship.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (200 B. C.) defines yoga as the suppression of the citta-vṛttis or the modifications of the mind. Among these modifications one group is called &#x2018;kliṣta&#x2019; (&#x2018;the afflicted&#x2019;). These &#x2018;kleśas&#x2019; or afflictions are again listed as five, of which &#x2018;asmitā&#x2019; or egoism is the second (2.3). It has been defined as the false identification of the seer or the Self, called dṛkśakti or puruṣa, with the instrument of seeing viz., the buddhi (intellect or mind) (2.6). When the puruṣa who is really asaṅga or unattached and free, thus gets identified with the mind, he experiences happiness and misery resulting in bondage. Due to this reason asmitā is called a kleśa, an affliction, which is an obstacle to yoga.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The third emperor of the Mauryan dynasty and one of the greatest that India has produced, Aśoka ruled during the period 272—232 B. C. His empire extended from Gāndhāra (Afghanistan) up to southern Karnataka. The terrible bloodshed witnessed during his conquest of the Kaliṅga Kingdom (Orissa) brought about a big change in his mental attitude. He thence-forward vowed to conquer by dharma rather than by war and violence. He is believed to have embraced Buddhism and dispatched Buddhist missionaries to several countries of the world. His rule was a golden era in Indian history. The several rock-edicts erected by him all over the country bespeak of his rule of dharma.</p>
			<p>Aśoka is also the name of a tree (<em>Saraca indica</em>) believed to be dear to Śiva, and hence, considered sacred. The grove of Aśoka trees is mentioned in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> as the place where Sītā was confined by the demon king Rāvaṇa. Hence Hindu women over the ages have associated it with constancy and chastity, have worshipped it, as also eaten its tender buds.</p>

			<p>Observance of festivals and sacred days is a common phenomenon in all societies that believe in and practise religion. In Hinduism, due to the variety and multiplicity of cults, the number of such days is legion.</p>
			<p>Aśokāṣṭamī is one of the less known or minor festivals. It is celebrated on the eighth day (aṣṭamī) of the bright fortnight in the month of Caitra (March-April) and the flowers of the Aśoka tree (<em>Saraca indica</em>) have been specially recommended for worship, Goddess Durgā being the deity of worship. Hence the name Aśokāṣṭamī. The day is considered doubly sacred if it happens to be a Wednesday with the Punarvasu nakṣatra (seventh lunar mansion consisting of two stars). On this day, housewives believe that, by eating the tiny buds of the Aśoka tree they will be free from śoka or sorrow (a-śoka = free from sorrow). A bath in the Brahmaputra river on this day is considered as very sacred, yielding the same fruit as the performance of the Vājapeya sacrifice.</p>

			<p>Upaniṣads are the most important sources of Vedānta philosophy. The ten Upaniṣads on which Śaṅkara (A.D. 788-820) wrote commentaries have been accepted as more ancient and authoritative. <em>Māṇḍū-kyopaniṣad</em>, the smallest of these, has the unique distinction of being commented upon by Gauḍapāda (7th cent. A. D.), the teacher of Govindapāda (8th cent. A. D.) who was himself the teacher of Śaṅkara. This commentary is well-known as <em>Māṇḍūkya Kārikā</em>. Śaṅkara has written a gloss over this also.</p>
			<p>The <em>Māṇḍūkya Kārikā</em> which advocates an extreme form of Advaita Vedānta, has used the term &#x2018;asparśa-yoga&#x2019; twice (3.39; 4.2). The word &#x2018;sparśa&#x2019; is generally used to signify contact of the sense-organs with the sense-objects. Hence any yoga or superconscious experience in which, naturally, there is no contact of the senses with the sense-objects may be called as asparśa-yoga. But in this work, this epithet has been especially used to denote the direct experience of the Ātman or the Self which is beyond the ken of all sense-organs and sense-experience. In this experience the lower self and the consequent ego-sense are completely dissolved leaving unalloyed bliss only. This is the same as &#x2018;jñāna.&#x2019; The prospect of dissolution of the ego-sense often frightens the ordinary yogis and spiritual aspirants who therefore try to avoid it (3.39). However, those who dare try it obtain the greatest happiness, the highest good and absolute freedom from all doubts and misgivings (4.2).</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;untouchability&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Aspṛśyatā or untouchability, as it has been practised during the last few centuries, is definitely a blot on the Hindu society. Even after its abolition by the Indian constitution (<em>vide</em> art. 17) it conti-nues to linger on, especially in the rural areas, due to age-old prejudices and lack of enlightenment brought about by the absence of proper education.</p>
			<p>Neither in the Vedas nor in the earlier dharmaśāstras do we find any sanction for this abominable practice. Though carmamnas (tanners of hides), caṇḍālas and paulkasas, vaptas (barbers) and others who have been included in the lists of aspṛśyas by the later works, have been mentioned, they had been considered as śūdras only.</p>
			<p>While describing the need to maintain physical cleanliness and ceremonial purity on certain occasions, a kind of aspṛśyatā has been advocated in our secondary scriptures. For instance: The following persons were declared as aspṛśyas and coming into contact with them would oblige one to take a bath:—those in sūtaka and aśauca (observing ceremonial impurity brought about by birth or death of close relatives in a family), a woman in her monthly courses, those who have not washed their hands after food, those engaged in trades which soil the body and the clothes like butchery or removing night-soil, sinners and criminals.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that the very same scriptures have shown immense wisdom in ordaining that even such untouchability need not be observed in holy places and on holy occasions like a rathotsava (temple-car festival) or during national emergencies. Some of the dharmaśāstras like the <em>Smṛtyarthasāra</em> of Śrīdhara (A. D. 1200) permit the aspṛśyas to enter temples. They were permitted to worship the images of the avatāras or incarnations of Viṣṇu and were expected to follow the moral code. They were also free to practise devotion to God through nāmajapa (repetition of the divine name) and singing devotional songs. Quite a few great saints of Hinduism belonged to the caste of the untouchables and were honoured by the entire society.</p>
			<p>It is rather, difficult to say when exactly untouchability became a rigid and fossilised system. What began as a segregation of persons engaged in unclean vocations due to reasons of health and sanitation, might have been perpetuated by vested economic interests, by gradually denying them educational, economic and cultural upliftment. It was purely a social phenomenon and had nothing to do with Hindu religion.</p>
			<p>The list of names of various castes and subcastes included under the aspṛśya groups seems to have grown quite long in course of time. In practice, it was taken to such ridiculous proportions that even if the shadow of an untouchable fell on a person of the higher castes, it was polluting!</p>
			<p>In modern times, eradication of the system of untouchability engaged the minds of great leaders like Mahātmā Gāndhī and Nārāyaṇa Guru. The diffusion of good education and culture, impressing upon everyone of the equality of all persons before the law and God, can help in this onerous task. If the more educated persons in these castes take greater interest in uplifting their less fortunate brothers and sisters, the pace of reformation of the society would be quicker.</p>

		<description>
			<p>According to the value-system propounded by Hinduism, mokṣa or spiritual emancipation is the ultimate goal of life. However, emotional infirmities like attachment and aversion or lust, greed and anger always raise their ugly heads to thwart man&#x2019;s spiritual progress. With an uncanny insight into human psychology the ancient sages of India have prescribed a way of life which affords scope and opportunity for the fulfilment of all the legitimate desires, while keeping them under a healthy check. The concept of the four puruṣārthas (See <ref>PURUṢĀRTHAS</ref>.), when looked at from this angle, is a unique contribution. The philosophy behind this concept aims at the gradual sublimation of the human instincts by first allowing them to find a healthy expression. The method of achieving this is the āśrama-system.</p>
			<p>According to this system, the life of the individual is divided into four āśramas or stages of life: brahmacarya (student-hood), gārhasthya (married state), vāna-prastha (the state of the forest recluse) and saṁnyāsa (monkhood).</p>
			<p>Brahmacarya was the first stage of life. It was the period (usually of twelve years&#x2019; duration from the seventh or eighth to the nineteenth or twentieth year) devoted to study and discipline. The student was required to stay in the house of his teacher and learn the sciences and arts.</p>
			<p>The preceptors in ancient India usually lived in hermitages not far from towns. The children under their care lived under the same roof without any distinction of wealth and status, all leading a hard, austere life. Serving the teacher and participating in the household duties were as much part of their life as learning the Vedas and secular sciences. Begging the food, eschewing the pleasures of life (in which brahmacarya or continence was the most important), abstaining from the affairs of the world were important aspects of their training.</p>
			<p>After returning home, the student, now a young man, was usually expected to marry and raise a family. Since marriage was considered a sacrament and the wife as a life-mate in righteous living, it was not considered as an obstacle to self-evolution. The gṛhastha or the householder was expected to earn well by righteous means and live a happy and decent life, which had to be socially useful. Among his principal duties were the five daily sacrifices, known as pañcayajñas: sacrifice to gods like Indra, study and teaching of the Vedas, obsequial offerings to the departed manes, feeding guests and domestic animals.</p>
			<p>At the approach of old age, the householder was to hand over the responsi-bilities of the family to his children and retire to the forest along with his wife, if she was willing. In this stage known as &#x2018;vānaprastha&#x2019; (vana = forest, prasthāna = going) he was to lead a contemplative life, in spiritual pursuits. It was actually a life preparatory to the final stage, saṁnyāsa.</p>
			<p>When the forest recluse felt enough inner strength to totally renounce all possessions and lead the life of an itinerant monk, he would embrace saṁnyāsa or the monastic life after sending his wife to be taken care of by the children. In this stage he had to move about constantly, begging his food and spending his entire time in contemplation on the Self or God. He was to practise self-control, freedom from desires, ambitions and attachments, and, universal love.</p>
			<p>Though these four āśramas were intended to be adopted successively, excep-tions were allowed in special cases, so that persons could take to saṁnyāsa even from the first or the second stage.</p>
			<p>Again, it was the dvijas or the &#x2018;twice-born&#x2019; classes (brāhmaṇas, kṣattriyas and vaiśyas) that were considered eligible for this fourfold āśrama system. Some scriptures allowed saṁnyāsa only to the brāhmaṇas.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;āśrama&#x2019;, in a non-technical sense means a place of resting, a hermi-tage of sages. Such āśramas were generally built in places of natural beauty and quietness, like a forest, banks of rivers, foot or top of a hill and so on. They were earmarked for &#x2018;simple living and high thinking&#x2019;, for austerities, contemplation and spiritual studies.</p>

			<word>Āśrama Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>As the very name suggests, this minor Upaniṣad belonging to the <em>Atharvaveda</em>, deals with the āśramas or stages of life. The treatment however is very brief.</p>
			<p>There are four recognized āśramas: brahmacarya, gārhasthya, vānaprastha and saṁnyāsa. Those following the ways of life of these four āśramas are respectively called brahmacārins (Vedic students), gṛhasthas (householders), vānaprasthins (forest recluses) and saṁnyāsins (mendicants or monks).</p>
			<p>The brahmacārins are of four types: gāyatra, brāhmaṇa, prājāpatya and bṛhan.</p>
			<p>The &#x2018;gāyatra&#x2019; is the novice who has had his upanayana ceremony and has been taught the Gāyatrīmantra. He is expected to subsist for three days after the upa-nayana, on food bereft of jaggery and salt. A &#x2018;brāhmaṇa&#x2019; is one who lives in his preceptor&#x2019;s house for 48 years to learn all the four Vedas, the study of each Veda needing about twelve years. A &#x2018;prājāpatya&#x2019; is one who is faithful to his wife. Alter-natively, those who spend 24 years and 48 years with their preceptors to learn the Vedas are called &#x2018;brāhmaṇas&#x2019; and &#x2018;prājāpatyas&#x2019; respectively. The &#x2018;bṛhan&#x2019; is one who lives with his preceptor throughout his life. He is also called &#x2018;naiṣṭhika&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The gṛhasthas are also of four kinds: vārtākavṛtti, śālīnavṛtti, yāyāvara and ghora-saṁnyāsika.</p>
			<p>Among these, the first group lives by agriculture, dairy-farming, trade and commerce, the vocations considered blameless. They live their full span of life, working and praying to the Supreme Self. The second group of gṛhasthas perform the Vedic rituals, study the Vedas and give gifts to others. However, they do not undertake to perform Vedic sacrifices for others, nor teach the Vedas to others, nor accept gifts. The third group of gṛhasthas do both: performing sacrifices for themselves and for others; studying and teaching the Vedas; giving and accepting gifts. Both the second and the third groups continue to maintain the Vedic fires and pray to the Supreme Self. The last group, the most austere, is particular in using water brought from wells and purified by straining as also live upon grain picked up from the fields (This is called &#x2018;uñchavṛtti&#x2019;.) daily. These gṛhasthas too perform the prescribed Vedic rites throughout life and pray to the Supreme Self.</p>
			<p>The vānaprasthins too are of four varieties: vaikhānasa, udumbara, bāla-khilya (or vālakhilya), and phenapa.</p>
			<p>The vaikhānasas maintain the sacred fires with the help of dried wood grown wildly, perform the five daily sacrifices and pray to the Supreme Self. The udumbaras too do the same thing except that they maintain the sacred fires by the wood of the fig or jujube trees found in the direction in which they wake up in the morning. The bālakhilyas wear long hair and coarse dress made of cotton, skin or bark, give up flowers and fruits on certain specified days, follow the earlier professions for maintenance, perform the five daily sacrifices and pray to the Supreme Self. The last group, phenapas, behave like insane persons, live by eating cast off leaves and fruits, maintain the Vedic fires wherever they are, perform the five daily sacrifices and pray to the Supreme Self.</p>
			<p>The saṁnyāsins also are of four categories: kuṭīcara, bahūdaka, haṁsa and paramahaṁsa.</p>
			<p>The first beg their food from the houses of their own sons. The second wear all the insignias of the saṁnyāsins like wooden sandals, loin cloth, ochre robes and so on, and beg their food from the house of brāhmaṇas of good conduct. They keep the tuft of hair and the sacred thread also. The third, keep these insignias but give up the tuft of hair. They carry a staff and a waterpot. They roam about not halting in any place for more than one to three days and perform severe austerities. The last, the paramahaṁsas, are the highest in this series. They do not carry any of the usual insignias of the saṁnyāsins, live in deserted and lonely places like abandoned buildings or temples, have transcended all social rules, customs and manners, accept alms from all without distinction and practise supreme equanimity. All these four cate-gories too pray to the Supreme Self.</p>

			<p>The Hindu tradition, over the centuries, has recognized eighteen &#x2018;vidyā-sthānas&#x2019; or &#x2018;vidyās&#x2019;, sources of knowledge or sciences. They comprise both the primary and the secondary sources from which we can know &#x2018;dharma&#x2019;, righteousness, as also duties and responsibilities. They are the four Vedas (<em>Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda</em> and <em>Atharvaveda</em>), the six Vedāṅgas (Śikṣā, Vyākaraṇa, Chandas, Nirukta, Jyotiṣa and Kalpa), purāṇas, Mīmāṁsā, Nyāya, dharmaśāstras and the four Upavedas (Āyurveda, Dhanurveda, Gāndharvaveda and Arthaśāstra). In some reckonings, Sthāpatyaveda and Śilpa-śāstra (architecture and sculpture) consi-dered as one science, replace Arthaśāstra.</p>

			<p>In Hindu temples, the original icon in the garbhagṛha or <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>, called &#x2018;dhruvabera&#x2019; is generally made of stone and is permanently fixed. As the temple rituals evolved into elaborate proportions, the need for a subsidiary image, a replica or a representative of the original, also arose. It was this image that was taken out in procession on festival days. Hence it was called &#x2018;utsava-mūrti&#x2019; or &#x2018;procession-image.&#x2019; Such images—also any portable image used in ritualistic worship—were mostly prepared out of &#x2018;aṣṭadhātus&#x2019; or eight metals viz., gold, silver, iron, tin, lead, copper, zinc and mercury (or brass).</p>
			<p>Sometimes the term &#x2018;aṣṭalohas&#x2019; is also used for the same.</p>

			<p>Vyākaraṇa or grammar is a very important Vedāṅga (&#x2018;limb of the Vedas&#x2019;), the subsidiary branches of knowledge which help a better understanding of the Vedas. Unlike in other languages, vyākaraṇa is considered as an independent science and it even puts forth its own philosophy. Though the works like the &#x2018;prātiśākhyas&#x2019; (treatises on phonetics) of the Vedas and the <em>Nirukta</em> (Vedic etymo-logy) of Yāska (800 B. C.) have dealt with grammar, the treatment there has been insufficient. It was Pāṇini (c. 500 B.C.) who systematized grammar, drawing upon the ancient grammarians like Āpiśali, Kaśyapa and Gārgya (none of whose works is available now) and adding his own, fairly significant, contribution.</p>
			<p>His work is known as <em>Aṣṭādhyāyī</em> since it comprises eight chapters (aṣṭa = eight; adhyāya = chapter). It is in the form of sūtras or aphorisms, 3996 in number.</p>
			<p>The contents are: technical terms and rules of interpretation, nouns in composition and case-relations; the adding of suffixes to roots and to nouns; accents and changes of sounds in word-formation and the word in the sentences.</p>
			<p>For centuries, this work has been accepted as the most basic and standard work in Sanskrit grammar and holds unrivalled sway even now. There have been several commentaries on this work, the <em>Mahābhāṣya</em> of Patañjali (200 B. C.) being the most celebrated of all. Some pieces of the critical commentary called &#x2018;vārttika&#x2019; written by Kātyāyana (c. 350 B. C.) are also available.</p>
			<p>Since the whole work is oriented towards unfolding the linguistic pheno-mena of Sanskrit, it is not arranged as in modern grammars, according to the parts of speech. It was Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita (A. D. 1600-1650) who rearranged the work in this way facilitating an easier study of the subject. His work is known as <em>Siddhānta-kaumudī</em>.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The <em>Ṛgveda</em>, the first and the foremost of the four Vedas, consists of 10,552 mantras or verses. There are two well-known systems of dividing these mantras into books, sections or chapters. As per the first system which groups the mantras according to the deities, topics and metres, the <em>Ṛgveda</em> is divided into ten &#x2018;maṇḍalas&#x2019;, each maṇḍala being subdivided again into &#x2018;anuvāka&#x2019; and &#x2018;sūkta&#x2019;. Though this method is good from the standpoint of study, it is not good from the standpoint of memorization (which had a supreme place in ancient Vedic studies) since there is a large variation in the number of mantras in each maṇḍala. Hence an attempt was made later to divide the whole of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> into eight sections, each called an &#x2018;aṣṭaka,&#x2019; keeping the total number of mantras in each aṣṭaka almost the same. Each aṣṭaka was again sub-divided into eight &#x2018;adhyāyas&#x2019; or chapters and the adhyāyas into &#x2018;vargas&#x2019; or groups. The vargas consisted of the mantras. Due care has been taken to maintain the total number of akṣaras or letters in each aṣṭaka the same, since some mantras are in longer metres.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Performance of religious rites in honour of the dead ancestors exists in all the societies of the world, in some form or the other. The &#x2018;aṣṭakā&#x2019; (also known as &#x2018;aṣṭaka-śrāddha&#x2019;) is a Vedic rite enjoined to be performed in honour of the pitṛs or ancestors (aṣṭaka = pitṛ, ancestor). The name is also derived from the fact that it has to be done on the eighth day (aṣṭakā = of the eighth day) of the dark fortnights of the four months—Mārgaśīrṣa, Pauṣa, Māgha and Phālguna (November to February). Though it is meant for the pitṛs or ancestors, deities like Viśvedevas, Agni and Sūrya are also mentioned as the recipients of the offerings. The total number of such rites is generally three. Cooked vegetables, cakes and even flesh are the offerings.</p>
			<p>Sometimes the rites are compressed into one rite spread over three days or even one day in the month of Māgha (Jan.-Feb.).</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the eight-syllabled [mantra]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hindu religious tradition stresses the great importance of &#x2018;mantra-japa&#x2019; or repetition of the divine name or sacred formula. There are several such names and formulae which must be received in a ceremonial way from a competent person, called guru or spiritual preceptor. This is known as &#x2018;dīkṣā&#x2019; or initiation. The repetition of these divine names and sacred formulae done as per the injunctions of the guru can give any desired fruit.</p>
			<p>Among the more well-known of such mantras is the &#x2018;aṣṭākṣarī&#x2019;, the eight-syllabled mantra: <em>oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya</em>, &#x2018;Obeisance to Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Lord!&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The first syllable <em>Om</em> (also called &#x2018;praṇava&#x2019;) is the most common and widely used word-symbol for Brahman or God, the Supreme Spirit. It is composed of three letters <em>a, u</em> and <em>m</em>. In the Vaiṣṇavite tradition of Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017—1037), <em>a</em> stands for Nārāyaṇa/Viṣṇu, <em>u</em> for Lakṣmī, his Consort and <em>m</em> for the jīva or the individual soul. It thus represents the totality of the Nārāyaṇa-principle viz., God (the Supreme independent Reality), his Power and the souls (who are depen-dent realities).</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Nārāyaṇa&#x2019; (of &#x2018;nārāyaṇāya&#x2019;) that stands for God, the Supreme Reality, is interpreted in several ways of which three are more important:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>One who has made the causal waters his abode;</li>
				<li>One who has made the human beings (or all living beings) his abode;</li>
				<li>one who has become the abode for human beings (or all living beings). The first is an explanation from the mythological standpoint wherein he is depicted as resting on the serpent Śeṣa or Ādiśeṣa, in the kṣrīrasamudra or the ocean of milk. The second and the third depict him as the immanent and the transcendent principle of creation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The word &#x2018;namaḥ&#x2019; which means obeisance, also signifies &#x2018;not mine&#x2019; (but thine) (na = not, maḥ = mine).</p>
			<p>A minor Upaniṣad called <em>Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> deals with this mantra and the fruits of its repetition which include the destruction of sins and reaching Vaikuṇṭha, the Perfect Abode of Nārāyaṇa.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;eight [objects] of auspiciousness&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Traditional Hinduism has always considered certain objects and living beings as &#x2018;maṅgala&#x2019; or auspicious. Coming across them by chance, seeing them, receiving them as gifts, giving them as gifts or honouring them—all these (depending upon the type of object) have been deemed to produce auspiciousness.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Aṣṭamaṅgala&#x2019; is a term often used in the religious works to indicate eight such objects of auspiciousness, though there is no unanimity among the lists given. These objects may be necessary on important occasions as the coronation of a king, or they may be depicted as motifs in architecture. In a few rare cases as in a vrata (religious vow) they represent the objects to be gifted.</p>
			<p>The aṣṭamaṅgalas are: lion, bull, serpent or elephant, pitcher, cāmara (cauri made of the bushy hairs of a yak&#x2019;s tail) or a hand-fan, flag, trumpet or drum and lamp.</p>
			<p>As per another list, they are: a brāhmaṇa, cow, fire, gold, ghee (butter-oil), the sun, water and a king.</p>
			<p>Other objects included in such lists (keeping of course, the total number always eight) are: fruits, corns, book, mirror, conch, the svastika sign, white umbrella, a pair of fish, head of a horse, wheel, lotus and throne.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Āyurveda or the &#x2018;science of longevity&#x2019; is a very ancient health science having its origins in the Veda itself. It is sometimes called &#x2018;Aṣṭāṅga&#x2019; since it has eight limbs (aṣṭa = eight, aṅga = limb), like śalya (major surgery), śālākya (minor surgery), kāya-cikitsā (therapeutics) and so on. Among the few texts largely used by the students of Āyurveda, the <em>Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya</em> (sometimes called <em>Aṣṭāṅga-hṛdaya-saṁhitā</em> also) of Vāgbhaṭa has an eminent place.</p>
			<p><em>Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya</em> is a basic extant work on Āyurveda, one of the three such works known as <em>Bṛhattrayī,</em> the other two being the Saṁhitās of Caraka and Suśruta.</p>
			<p>Two Vāgbhaṭas have been known to the historians of Āyurveda, one the author of <em>Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha</em> and the other of <em>Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya</em>. Though opinion is divided as to whether the two Vāgbhaṭas are identical or different, most of the scholars are inclined towards the view that Vāgbhaṭa II was a different person and was the grandson of Vāgbhaṭa I. He was the son of one Siṁha Gupta and a disciple of Avalokiteśvara. He probably lived in the 7th/8th centuries A. D.</p>
			<p>The work, composed in anuṣṭubh verses, comprises of six &#x2018;sthānas&#x2019; or sections. <em>Sūtrasthāna</em>, the first, consists of 30 chapters and deals with many fundamental concepts of the science and prelimi-naries common to the other sections. <em>Śarīrasthāna</em>, the second, spread over 6 chapters deals with anatomy and physio-logy. <em>Nidānasthāna</em>, the third, comprising 16 chapters deals with pathology. <em>Cikitsā-sthāna</em>, the fourth, deals with therapeutics in its 21 chapters. <em>Kalpasthāna</em>, the fifth, has 6 chapters on toxicology. <em>Uttarasthāna</em>, the last, is a long section spread over 40 chapters and deals with a number of miscellaneous topics like paediatrics, mental diseases, diseases of the eye, the E.N.T., poisons and their antidotes, venereal diseases as also virilification.</p>
			<p>An elaborate discussion on the chemistry of digestion and prescription of several medicines prepared out of metals like gold, silver, copper, tin and lead is one of the specialities of this work.</p>
			<p>As many as 36 commentaries (both in Sanskrit and in vernaculars) have been listed by scholars on this work. Out of them, 11 are not available now. Of the rest, the <em>Sarvāṅgasundarī</em> of Aruṇadatta (A. D. 1220) is best known.</p>
			<p>It has been quoted in the Arabic work <em>Kitabul Fihrist</em> (A. D. 888) under the title <em>Asaṅkar</em> or Aṣṭaṅkar.</p>

			<p>The tantras, the secondary scriptures advocating the worship of the Divine Mother, give a list of the &#x2018;aṣṭapāśas&#x2019; or the eight &#x2018;bonds&#x2019; or &#x2018;fetters&#x2019; which obstruct our spiritual progress. They are: ghṛṇā (pity), lajjā (bashfulness), bhaya (fear), śaṅkā (doubt), jugupsā (aversion), kula (family), śīla (conduct, uprightness) and jāti (birth or caste).</p>
			<p>While approaching God all these—though they may be virtues under certain conditions—should be given up. For instance, lajjā or bashfulness, is necessary in civilized society. But while dancing, taking the name of God, there should be no lajjā.</p>
			<p>There are variations in the lists we get. Other items that find a place in such lists are: māna (honour), tṛṣā (desire), kāma (lust) and lobha (greed).</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Works on Yoga describe various &#x2018;siddhis&#x2019; or supernatural powers that accrue to one who follows their methods. Patañjali in his well-known <em>Yogasūtras</em> has devoted the whole of the third chapter to describing such siddhis apart from dealing with them in parts of the second and fourth chapters also.</p>
			<p>Of the several such powers described, a group of eight, has been specially desig-nated as &#x2018;aṣṭasiddhis&#x2019; or eight supernatural powers. They generally go together. They are: aṇimā (power to assume minute forms), mahimā (power to expand to huge proportions), garimā (power to grow heavy), laghimā (power to become light or weightless), prāpti (capacity to obtain even the most difficult things), prākāmya (having irresistible will), īśitṛtva (perfect mastery over the body, senses and, capa-city to create or destroy outside objects) and vaśitva (full control over the movement of physical objects) (<em>vide</em> 3.45).</p>
			<p>The list varies from work to work. The other powers that are sometimes included (the total of course, being always eight) are: kāmāvasāyitva (power of immediate fulfilment of desires), prakāma-vṛṣṭi (power to bring rain at will), akṛṣṭa-pacya (power to get crops without culti-vation), ūhā (capacity to acquire knowledge without a teacher) and so on.</p>
			<p>Patañjali himself administers a warning that these powers are incidental in spiritual life and will prove to be formidable obstacles to self-realization (<em>Yogasūtras</em> 3.37).</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the great sages whose name has been associated with a well-known work of Advaita philosophy, the <em>Aṣṭā-vakragītā</em>, Aṣṭāvakra was the son of the sage Kahola. While yet in the womb, the baby-sage is said to have laughed at the wrong intonation of the Vedas by his father, incurred his wrath and was cursed by him to be born with a body crooked in eight places. Hence the name &#x2018;Aṣṭāvakra.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>A scholar, Bandi by name, of the court of the king Janaka, had defeated Kahola and had got him imprisoned in water. When Aṣṭāvakra came to know of the tragedy that had befallen his father, he went to the court of Janaka, vanquished Bandi in disputation and rescued his father Kahola. At his instance, who was now highly pleased with his son, Aṣṭāvakra took bath in the river Samaṅgā (also called Madhuvilā) and got rid of all the physical defects.</p>
			<p>Another well-known sage of the Upaniṣads, Śvetaketu, the son of Gautama Āruṇi was the uncle of Aṣṭāvakra.</p>
			<p>The work <em>Aṣṭāvakragītā</em>, also known as <em>Aṣṭāvakra Saṁhitā</em>, contains 298 verses in the simple anuṣṭubh metre, spread over 20 chapters. Most of the chapters are very small. The 18th chapter alone, however, contains 100 verses.</p>
			<p>The book, which often gives the description of the ātman in hyperbolic terms stresses that it can be realized here and now. Disciplines like renouncing the desires for the pleasures of life, cultivating virtues like forgiveness, kindness and truth are advocated. There is a beautiful description of the man of knowledge in the 17th chapter. Supreme detachment is a special characteristic of his. But it is difficult to recognize him since he often lives like an ordinary person. Only another man of knowledge can recognize him.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Vīraśaivism or the Liṅgāyata cult is a form of Śaivism. Basava (12th century) (also called Basavaṇṇa or Basaveśvara) was the reorganizer of this cult, if not the founder. The followers of this cult are seen mostly in the Karnataka State.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Aṣṭāvaraṇa&#x2019; is the second aspect of the practice of this cult, the first being &#x2018;pañcācāra.&#x2019; &#x2018;Āvaraṇa&#x2019; means protective covering. The Liṅgāyata cult recognizes eight such protective coverings. They are: guru (spiritual teacher), liṅga (emblem of Śiva), jaṅgama (roving ascetic), pādodaka (water sanctified by the touch of the feet of the guru or the jaṅgama), prasāda (food sanctified by the guru or the jaṅgama), bhasma (sacred ashes), rudrākṣa (rosary of the rudrākṣa beads) and mantra (mystic formula).</p>
			<p>Guru is the spiritual teacher who initiates the novice into the mysteries of the Vīraśaiva cult. Liṅga is the emblem of Lord Śiva, a concrete symbol of the Supreme, given to the initiate by the guru at the time of initiation. The disciple is expected to wear it on his body always and worship it at the appointed hour. Jaṅgama is any roving ascetic of the Vīraśaiva faith who should be treated as equal to the guru. The water with which the feet of the guru or the jaṅgama are washed or is sanctified by the touch of their feet, is pādodaka. Any food that is offered to them and sanctified by their touch is prasāda. Pādodaka and prasāda are to be consumed by the initiated devo-tees. Bhasma or the sacred ashes should be smeared on the body at the appropriate places (like forehead, arms and so on). Rudrākṣa or the rosary of rudrākṣa beads is to be used for keeping count of the japa of the mantra or the mystic formula (&#x2018;namaś śivāya&#x2019;) received from the guru during initiation. The rudrākṣa rosary may also be worn on the body.</p>
			<p>These eight coverings act as shields against impurities of the body and mind, and protect the Vīraśaiva from the onslaughts of sin.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em>, the basic scripture of Hinduism, contains several beauti-ful hymns addressed to gods like Indra. These Vedic gods are usually enumerated as thirty-three, among whom the &#x2018;Aṣṭavasus&#x2019; or &#x2018;Eight Vasus&#x2019; form the first group.</p>
			<p>The Vasus are a class of deities, chiefly known as attendants of Indra. The word &#x2018;Vasu&#x2019; is derived from the root &#x2018;vas&#x2019; (&#x2018;to dwell&#x2019;, &#x2018;to cause to dwell,&#x2019; &#x2018;to shine&#x2019;) and hence the &#x2018;Vasus&#x2019; are deities representing all spheres of extension or space, and height. They are personifications of nature and natural phenomena.</p>
			<p>The eight Vasus are: Dharā (the earth), Anala (the fire), Ap (the waters), Anila (the wind), Dhruva (the polestar), Soma (the moon), Prabhāsa (the dawn), and Pratyūṣa (the light).</p>
			<p>According to the <em>Viṣṇupurāṇa</em> (1.15) the Aṣṭavasus were the eight sons of Vasu, the wife of Dharma, and one of the ten daughters of Dakṣa Prajāpati. The <em>Mahābhārata</em> (1.99) says that one of them was born on earth as Bhīṣma due to a curse.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Hindu scriptures have time and again stressed the importance of strict ethical life as a pre-condition to spiritual enlightenment. A strict ethical life is essential even for social harmony and peace.</p>
			<p>Among the few cardinal ethical principles delineated in these works, &#x2018;asteya&#x2019; or &#x2018;non-stealing&#x2019; is also one. The <em>Yogasūtras</em> (2.30) of Patañjali (200 B. C.) has included this under the first aṅga or limb of yoga, viz., yama. It is the third in the series of five such qualities.</p>
			<p>Though &#x2018;steya&#x2019; means &#x2018;stealing&#x2019; and hence &#x2018;asteya&#x2019; means &#x2018;non-stealing,&#x2019; its connotation goes much beyond this restric-ted sense. All actions of appropriation of others&#x2019; things, not sanctioned by the scriptures, should be brought under this head.</p>
			<p>Since greed has been recognized as a natural infirmity of the human mind (<em>vide Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> 5.2.2 and <em>Īśāvāsya Upaniṣad</em> 1) it is no wonder that the scriptures have laid such an emphasis on &#x2018;asteya.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Rules regarding ahiṁsā (non-injury), asteya and so on, may be relaxed under certain extraordinary conditions sanctioned by the scriptures. Thus, stealing of food is permitted when a person is dying of hunger during famine and is unable to procure food in any other way. But for persons who have totally dedicated themselves for spiritual enlightenment, no exemptions are allowed (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 2.31). For them, it is a &#x2018;mahāvrata&#x2019; or &#x2018;great vow.&#x2019;</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;[rite of] collecting the bones [of the dead]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Throughout the human history, disposal of the dead and the rites connected with it have acquired a religious colour for the obvious reason that death is as much an awe-inspiring wonder of nature as birth. The Hindu scriptures which look upon the whole life of a man as a yajña or a sacrifice, have treated the subject of dying, death and after-death rites as a part of religion. The rites should be conducted with proper religious fervour so that the soul of the dead gets peace.</p>
			<p>The rite of &#x2018;asthisañcayana&#x2019; or &#x2018;collec-ting the bones&#x2019; (of the dead) is performed only in cases where the body has been cremated. The nearest relative of the dead person, with the help of some elders, usually old men in odd numbers, collects the charred remains of the bones in a specified way. The rite includes circumambulation of the place of cremation, sprink-ling milk with water with the branch of a śamī tree (<em>Prosopis specigera</em>), collection of bones from the feet to the head and filling them in an urn. Appropriate mantras from the <em>Ṛgveda</em> have to be chanted during the whole operation. The urn is then buried in a suitable spot, after which the relative takes a bath and performs a śrāddha or obsequial rite.</p>
			<p>But the most common practice in the modern days is to cast the bones in the waters of holy rivers like the Gaṅgā or the sea. The <em>Viṣṇudharmasūtras</em> (19.11-12) approves and recommends this practice as better.</p>
			<p>This rite is not performed for boys whose upanayana ceremony has not been performed.</p>

			<p>The word &#x2018;āstika,&#x2019; derived from the verb &#x2018;asti&#x2019; (&#x2018;exists&#x2019;) generally denotes anyone who believes in the existence of God and higher worlds like heaven, immortality of the soul, theory of karma and reincarnation and so on. Sometimes the word is used in the more restricted sense of one who believes in the authority of the Vedas. In this sense, the six well-known systems of Indian philosophy are called &#x2018;āstika&#x2019; as opposed to the Cārvāka, the Jaina and the Bauddha systems, which are designated as &#x2018;nāstika&#x2019; or &#x2018;non-believing.&#x2019;</p>

			<p>When the king Parīkṣit, the grandson of the Pāṇḍava prince Arjuna died of snakebite, his son Janamejaya performed a sarpayāga or snake sacrifice in which hundreds of innocent snakes were being immolated. The final offering was to be Takṣaka, the king of snakes of the nether world, the chief &#x2018;culprit&#x2019; who had bitten and killed Parīkṣit. Just then there appeared on the scene a young sage, Āstīka by name, the son of the Jaratkāru couple, and stopped the atrocious sacrifice. His mother was the sister of Vāsuki. He had been specially deputed to save the life of Vāsuki and all his subjects as also his followers, with his sweet speech and convincing logic. Āstīka was able to win over the king Janamejaya and extract the boon he wanted. Vāsuki and the snake species were thus saved from total annihilation.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Indian philosophical systems known as &#x2018;darśanas&#x2019; are generally divided into two groups: the āstika and the nāstika. The word &#x2018;āstika&#x2019; is usually interpreted as &#x2018;believing in the authority of the Vedas,&#x2019; which accept the existence of God, the soul, heaven and other worlds, the doctrines of karma and rebirth and so on. Hence the well-known six systems of philosophy—the &#x2018;ṣaḍ-darśanas&#x2019;—are grouped under the term &#x2018;āstika&#x2019;. The three systems of Cārvāka, Jaina and Bauddha, considered as heretical and heterodox, are classified under the term &#x2018;nāstika.&#x2019;</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;hymn containing 108 [names]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hymnology of Hinduism is as old as the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself. As the religion evolved and its influence spread, gradually absorbing and integrating various cults, sects and movements into its fold, the number of deities of the Hindu pantheon also increased. Consequently hymnology also grew to voluminous proportions.</p>
			<p>Among the various types of such hymns, or &#x2018;stotras&#x2019; as they are called, &#x2018;the aṣṭottaraśata&#x2019; as also the &#x2018;sahasranāma&#x2019; group plays a more significant role. It can be used not only for chanting but also for offering flowers and other objects used in worship, as a part of the ritualistic process, the latter being the more common.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;aṣṭottaraśata&#x2019; indicates the number 108. In the Hindu mystic and ritualistic traditions, this number, 108 (as also 1008), has acquired great significance. The several explanations offered for this are more academic and mystical than logically convincing.</p>
			<p>The aṣṭottaraśata hymns are always composed in the simple anuṣṭubh or śloka metre. They are generally preceded by certain preliminaries like &#x2018;nyāsas&#x2019; or conse-cration of one&#x2019;s body, paying homage to the ṛṣi, the sage through whom the hymn was revealed, the chandas or the deity presiding over the metre in which the hymn is composed, the devatā or the deity to whom the hymn is addressed, and, viniyoga or the purpose for which the hymn is chanted. There is also a dhyānaśloka, a verse in which the form of the deity is described in detail to facilitate meditation.</p>
			<p>The hymn itself contains 108 names of the deity, the names dealing with the form, qualities and exploits of the deity (based on the mythological accounts).</p>
			<p>When the names are used individually in pūjā or arcanā (ritualistic worship) they are repeated one after another, but in the &#x2018;caturthī vibhakti&#x2019; or dative case, adding the word &#x2018;namaḥ,&#x2019; &#x2018;obeisance&#x2019; at the end.</p>
			<p>For instance, the aṣṭottaraśatanāma-stotra of Śiva begins thus: <em>śivo maheśvaraḥ śambhuḥ</em>. When these names are used in worship, they are repeated as: <em>śivāya namaḥ, maheśvarāya namaḥ, śambhave namaḥ</em> and so on.</p>
			<p>Later Hinduism has attached great significance to these aṣṭottaraśatanāma and sahasranāma hymns. Their repetition is believed to yield many desired results. They are quite popular in the modern Hindu society and are widely used in the temples.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a special term used by Patañjali (200 B. C.) in his celebrated work the <em>Yogasūtras</em> (4.7). Normally the karma of individuals that fructify in this life or in the future lives is classified either as &#x2018;śukla&#x2019; (&#x2018;white;&#x2019; i.e., puṇya or meritorious) or as &#x2018;kṛṣṇa&#x2019; (&#x2018;black;&#x2019; i.e., pāpa or sinful). The former bring good results whereas the latter cause evil effects. But the karmas done by a perfected yogin are neither kṛṣṇa nor śukla, since he never commits sins; and offers the fruits of all his meritorious deeds to Īśvara or God. Hence his karma is known as &#x2018;aśukla-akṛṣṇa,&#x2019; &#x2018;neither white nor black&#x2019; and does not produce any result that will bind him in any way.</p>

			<word>asuras</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;beneficent being,&#x2019; &#x2018;those addicted to sense-pleasures&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The metamorphosis of the meaning of the word &#x2018;asura,&#x2019; from &#x2018;beneficent god&#x2019; to &#x2018;malevolent spirit or being&#x2019; in the Vedic and post-Vedic literature is rather baffling. In early Vedic literature (<em>vide Ṛgveda</em> 1.35.7; 1.131.1) the term denotes the Supreme Spirit. Derived probably from the root &#x2018;as&#x2019; (&#x2018;to exist&#x2019;), or &#x2018;asu&#x2019; (&#x2018;prāṇa or life-force&#x2019;), it must have originally meant the &#x2018;Self-existent Being&#x2019; or the &#x2018;Being of life-force and power.&#x2019; It is in this sense that the well-known Vedic deities Indra and Varuṇa have been called &#x2018;asuras&#x2019; (ibid 1.54.3; 1.24.14).</p>
			<p>But soon the connotation changed. The <em>Nirukta</em>, the standard dictionary of Vedic terms, defines the &#x2018;asuras&#x2019; as those &#x2018;who are not satisfied in their positions,&#x2019; &#x2018;the ever-fickle&#x2019; and &#x2018;those who are deprived of their positions by the suras or devas.&#x2019; In later literature, mostly the epics and the purāṇas, they are posited as &#x2018;a-suras&#x2019; or &#x2018;anti-gods,&#x2019; malevolent beings, ever opposed to the &#x2018;suras&#x2019; or &#x2018;devas,&#x2019; the &#x2018;beings of goodness and light&#x2019;. In this sense they are pictured as highly ambitious and aggressive people, rich, civilized and powerful, but ever bent on conquest and self-aggrandizement. And precisely because of this trait of theirs, they are ever in conflict with the devas representing the forces of goodness, refine-ment and culture.</p>
			<p>Though conflicts between the devas and the asuras are legion, there have also been occasions when they have cooperated, as for instance, in the case of churning of the ocean to get amṛta or nectar. There have been great asura kings like Prahlāda, Bali, Śambara and Bāṇa who were devotees of God (Viṣṇu or Śiva).</p>
			<p>In the mythological lore, the devas and the asuras are depicted as the children of the same father, the sage Kaśyapa, from his two wives Aditi and Diti. Sometimes, the asuras have been described as having been born out of the body of Brahmā or Prajāpati, the Creator.</p>
			<p>Whatever be the manner of their origin, the devas and the asuras appear more to be the archetypes of the good and the not-so-good beings in creation.</p>
			<p>In the earlier religious literature, the daityas and the dānavas, positively more malevolent beings, had been placed below the asuras. But gradually, the asuras were degraded and identified completely with the former.</p>
			<p>One of the very special powers the asuras seemed to possess and excel in, was sorcery and magic.</p>
			<p>Some Western scholars of Indology hazard the guess that the asuras were the hostile native rulers and tribes who were opposed to the Āryans. Due to lack of conclusive evidence to clinch the issue, it is difficult to accept such theories. The word may be more etymological and symbolical than historical, racial or social. It is significant to note that Śaṅkara (8th cent. A. D.) the great philosopher mystic, defines the asuras as &#x2018;those addicted to selfish bodily pleasures&#x2019; (<em>vide Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em>. 1.3.1)</p>

		<description>
			<p>Among the Ṣaḍ-darśanas or the six systems of Indian philosophy, Sāṅkhya-darśana has an important place. It is nearer to the Vedānta system and has been quite popular. Ideas of Sāṅkhya are found spread over the epics and the purāṇas too.</p>
			<p>The system is said to have originated from Kapila, and Āsuri was his chief disciple. Along with Pañcaśikha, the disciple of Āsuri, the three great teachers have put the system on a firm foundation. The <em>Mahābhārata</em> (12.219) gives an account of their teachings.</p>
			<p>Nothing is known of Āsuri except that he was a teacher of Sāṅkhya, a disciple of Kapila and guru of Pañcaśikha. Mythological lores say that Āsuri was a house-holder immersed in the world and it took a long time and much effort for his guru Kapila to awaken him to the path of spiritual life.</p>

			<word>Āśvalāyana</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Each of the four Vedas has several &#x2018;śākhās,&#x2019; branches or recensions. The origin of these śākhās probably lies in the fact that each of the principal sages like Paila or Vaiśampāyana, who transmitted the Vedas, had several disciples. These disciples or their successors did some editing and readjustments of the Vedic mantras to suit the needs of the rites which they performed and upon which the local culture too, sometimes, had its effect. This naturally led to the birth of these recensions.</p>
			<p>The name of Āśvalāyana is connected with the <em>Ṛgveda</em> as one of the authors of its śākhās. Not much is known of this Āśvalāyana except that he was the disciple of Śaunaka. Though one Kausalya Āśvalāyana is mentioned in the <em>Praśna Upaniṣad</em> (1.1; 3.1) and an Aśvala in the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> (3.1.1) it is very difficult to establish any connection between them and this Āśvalāyana. The <em>Anuśāsanaparva</em> (7.54) of the <em>Mahā-bhārata </em>mentions one Āśvalāyana as belonging to the gotra or lineage of Viśvāmitra, another great name among the sages. Some scholars opine that he is the same Āśvalāyana, the author of the Ṛgvedic recension.</p>
			<p>The Āśvalāyana recension of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> is almost identical with the Śākala recension except that the latter recognizes as canonical, the <em>Vālakhilya</em> supplementary hymn.</p>
			<p>One or two works of Āśvalāyana, out of the four attributed to him, are extant now: <em>Āśvalāyana Śrautasūtras</em> and <em>Āśvalāyana Gṛhyasūtras</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Āśvalāyana Śrautasūtras,</em> which closely follows the <em>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</em>, consists of twelve chapters. Each chapter is further subdivided into &#x2018;khaṇḍas&#x2019; or subsections, the total number of such khaṇḍas being 164. Each khaṇḍa is mostly in the form of a long sentence. The whole work, since it belongs to the Ṛgvedic group, deals mainly with the duties of the &#x2018;hotṛ,&#x2019; the priest connected with the chanting of the Ṛgvedic mantras during the sacrificial rites. The sacrifices and rites dealt with in this work are: Darśapūrṇamāsa, Agnyādhāna, Piṇḍapitṛyajña, Āgrayaṇī, Kārīrīṣṭi, Cāturmāsya, Sautrāmaṇi and Somayāga.</p>
			<p>The followers of this work are mostly in the southern regions of the river Godāvarī.</p>
			<p>The <em>Āśvalāyana Gṛhyasūtras</em> consists of four chapters divided into 48 &#x2018;kaṇḍikās&#x2019; or subsections. The topics dealt with in this work are: pākayajña, baliharaṇa, and the ṣoḍaśa (Sixteen) saṁskāras. Rules for the recitation of the Vedas are also given in one of the chapters.</p>
			<p>This work gives us the names of many ancient sages which are not found elsewhere.</p>

			<word>Aśvamedha</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;[that in which] a horse is immolated&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Aśvamedha is one of the most anci-ent, but major, sacrifices mentioned in the Vedic literature. It is mentioned in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (1.162; 163) and described in the <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> (13.1-5) and the <em>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa</em> (3.8.9). It derives its name from the fact that an &#x2018;aśva&#x2019; or a horse is made the &#x2018;medha&#x2019; or animal for immolation. Only emperors and very powerful kings who desired sovereignty could afford to perform it. It belongs to the &#x2018;Ahīna&#x2019; group of Soma sacrifices, i.e., Soma sacrifices in which Soma is pressed for more than one day; and, this can be from two to twelve days.</p>
			<p>The rite begins on the 8th or 9th day of the bright half of the month of Phālguna, when the horse, which must be all white in colour with dark spots, is bound, bathed and consecrated near the fire. The animal is then let off to wander about at will for a year, guarded by an escort of four hundred armed men, including one hundred princes. The kings or chieftains of the places which the horse enters, should either accept the sovereignty of the sacrificer and pay contributions or tie up the horse and face an armed conflict. In case the challenger wins, the sacrifice will get nullified. Even the death or disease of the horse will result in the same and the sacrificer will have to restart the whole process with a new horse. Meanwhile the sacrificer is expected to perform a number of rites everyday, during the period the horse is away.</p>
			<p>After the successful completion of the expedition and the return of the horse, the regular rites of the sacrifice commence. It is a Soma sacrifice of three days&#x2019; duration. The horse is immolated on the second day, along with a number of other victims, wild and tame, from the elephant to the bee. Before the carcass of the horse is cut up, the chief queen lies down beside it (by way of fertility spell) while an obscene dialogue between the priests and the other women of the king&#x2019;s harem is enacted. Before the offering of the omentum, &#x2018;brahmodya&#x2019; riddles (theological dialogues where questions and riddles are propounded and answered) are proposed and solved. The concluding bath (avabhṛtha-snāna) takes place on the third day.</p>
			<p>The sacrifice involves many subordinate rites and large quantities of gifts are given away to the priests and others.</p>
			<p>Though long lists of kings who had performed the Aśvamedha have been given in the Vedic works already referred to, the sacrifice itself seems to have become rare even by the time of these works, since they call it as &#x2018;utsanna&#x2019; (&#x2018;gone out of vogue&#x2019;). It appears to be a curious mixture of popular religions, tribal and symbolical elements, inextricably mixed up and a remnant of a hoary past.</p>
			<p>During the period of recorded history, Puṣyamitra Śuṅga (2nd cent. B. C.), Samudragupta (4th cent. A. D.) and some Cālukyan kings of South India seem to have performed it. The last one to perform it was Jaya Siṁha II of Jaipur in the 18th century.</p>

			<p>The <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (5.11) mentions that six sages under the leadership of Uddālaka Āruṇi, approach the king Aśvapati Kaikeya to learn <em>Vaiśvānara-vidyā</em> (the science concerning the Universal Self, known also as Brahman) from him. While welcoming them he states that in his kingdom there are no thieves, misers, drunkards, &#x2018;anāhitāgnis&#x2019; (those who have not set up consecrated Vedic fires&#x2019;) as also lecherous people. He questions them individually about what they have already known and then supplements the same with his teachings.</p>
			<p>The king of Kekaya State, the father of Kaikeyī (the youngest of the wives of the king Daśaratha of Ayodhyā), was also known as Aśvapati. Whether these two were the same, it is difficult to establish. Aśvapati was reputed to have been endowed with the knowledge of all the sounds of the subhuman living beings.</p>
			<p>The father of Sāvitrī, the well-known paragon of wifely virtues and chastity, was also an Aśvapati. He was the king of Madradeśa.</p>

			<p>Popular Hindu religion considers that visits to places of pilgrimage result in great merit as also destruction of sins. One of the minor places of pilgrimage (generally called &#x2018;tīrtha&#x2019; or &#x2018;tīrthakṣetra,&#x2019;) is Aśvatīrtha situated near Kanyākubja (the modern Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh). It is stated in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> (<em>Anuśāsanaparva</em> 4.17) that when the sage Ṛcīka wanted to marry Satyavatī, the daughter of the king Gādhi (father of the famous sage Viśvāmitra) he demanded 100 white horses, with one ear black in colour, as bridal fee. Ṛcīka prayed to god Varuṇa by whose grace the horses rose from the river Gaṅgā at this point. Hence the name.</p>
			<p>There are two more places of the same name, situated on the Narmadā and Godāvarī rivers. The latter is said to be the place where the twin deities, the Aśvins, were born (<em>Brahmapurāṇa</em> 89.43).</p>

			<p>Aśvattha (<em>Ficus religiosa</em>) is one of the highly revered trees in popular Hinduism. It is said to have issued forth from Indra, the king of gods. According to another version of mythology, it is a manifestation of Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (10.26) that he is the aśvattha among the trees. Since the gods sit under a celestial tree (<em>vide Atharvaveda</em> 5.3), holy men of the earth too sit under it here. Its shade is said to confer miraculous powers like understanding the language of animals or remembering former births. Childless women worship it and circumambulate it with the hope and faith of being granted children.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>In the scriptures, the eternal tree of life is compared to an aśvattha, with the roots in heaven and branches spread below (<em>vide Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> 6.1; <em>Maitrī Upaniṣad</em> 6.4; <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> 15.1-3).</p>
			<p>The wood of this tree was being used to prepare sacrificial vessels as also the upper araṇi (one of the two pieces of wood used for generating fire during Vedic sacrifices). Works of Āyurveda like the <em>Suśruta Saṁhitā</em> describe its bark, roots and fruits as being endowed with medicinal properties.</p>

		<description>
			<p>One of the great heroes of the Mahābhārata war, Aśvatthāman was the only son of Droṇācārya, the teacher of the Pāṇḍava and the Kaurava princes. As soon as he was born, he is said to have neighed like a horse. Hence the name.</p>
			<p>Though brought up in poverty he was well-trained by his father in the sacred lore, secular sciences and the art of war. His irascible temper often made him stray from the path of dharma. He earned ignominy by killing the sons of Draupadī while they were asleep and by trying to destroy the baby Parīkṣit in the womb of Uttarā, the wife of Abhimanyu and the future heir to the empire. He was punished by Bhīma, the second of the Pāṇḍavas and cursed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to suffer from serious diseases for a very long time. Though a little odd, he has been reckoned as one of seven &#x2018;Cirañjīvins&#x2019; or &#x2018;those who live forever.&#x2019;</p>

			<p>In this rite, after having adorned the house, having bathed and put on clean or white garments, the householder is expected to offer cooked food to Paśupati (Śiva) and also offer oblations of clarified butter to the Aśvins, the twin deities.</p>
			<p>The rite is sometimes called &#x2018;Pṛṣātaka,&#x2019; and is performed for obtaining general prosperity. Tying of amulets of herbs on the arms is also recommended in this rite.</p>

			<p>They are twin-deities that are given an important place in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. At least 50 sūktas are in praise of them. They are always described and eulogized together. Being considered as the twin sons of Sūrya (the Sun-god) and his spouse Saṁjñā when they had assumed the horse-form, they have been described as &#x2018;Aśvinau,&#x2019; or Aśvīni-kumāras (aśva = horse).</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>It is rather difficult to say what aspect of the powers of nature they represent. That they stand for night and day, or earth and sky, or moon and sun, is the opinion of some scholars. There is also one view that they were originally two kings who were gradually elevated to godhood.</p>
			<p>They are pictured as semi-darkness before dawn. They pervade this world with moisture and light. They are eternally young and handsome. In fact, they are the youngest of gods.</p>
			<p>Their chief characteristic is that they are continuously striving to do good to others. They are expert physicians and surgeons. They know the arts of healing, rejuvenation and even plastic surgery. When supplicated, they grant children, food, wealth, health and protection from enemies. Hence they are invariably invoked during the Vedic sacrifices.</p>
			<p>Their many exploits like granting youth to the old sage Cyavana, sight to the young Upamanyu who had lost his eyesight, children to Mādrī, the younger queen of Pāṇḍu are also described in the mythological literature.</p>
			<p>Tradition recognizes them as important teachers of Āyurveda, the science of health and longevity.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word is probably derived from &#x2018;athar,&#x2019; an obsolete word for fire, and hence means a priest connected with the worship of fire. According to Vedic mythology, Atharvan was son of Brahmā, the Creator. He first brought down fire from heaven and offered soma into it with the recitation of appropriate mantras learnt from his father. He is sometimes considered as the propagator of the fourth Veda which is hence called the <em>Atharvaveda</em> or the <em>Atharvaṇaveda</em>. His wife was Śānti, the daughter of Kardama Prajāpati. He is sometimes identified with Aṅgiras, called Atharvāṅgiras, and is considered as the father of Agni, the fire-god.</p>
			<p>This word, as also the word Atharvāṅgiras, is sometimes used to indicate the descendants of this sage.</p>
			<p>The word Atharvan also refers to the hymns of the <em>Atharvaveda</em>.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Jyotiṣa or astronomy is one of the six Vedāṅgas or subsidiary sciences that help us to understand the Vedas. Since performance of sacrifices was the most important aspect of the Vedic religion and it was related to different periods of the year as also time and the position of the stars, a separate science called &#x2018;Jyotiṣa&#x2019; was evolved in course of time. Each of the four Vedas developed its own Jyotiṣa.</p>
			<p>The work <em>Ātharvaṇa-jyotiṣa</em> as extant today comprises 162 verses and may be a recast of an earlier work. It is generally assigned to the 2nd cent. B. C. It deals with muhūrta (a particular division of time), karaṇa (an astrological division of day), yoga (leading star of a lunar aste-rism; a variable division of time), tithi (lunar day) and vāra (day of the week). It is said to fall outside the Vedic period but before the period of the Siddhānta calendar which divides the zodiac into twelve rāśis or signs. It adopts a scheme of nakṣatra astrology. It forms nine groups of three nakṣatras (asterisms) each, the total being 27. Information is provided at length as to what should be done or not to be done on the presence of the nine groups and their constituents.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a small Upaniṣad belonging to the <em>Atharvaveda</em>. It is in prose. It is divided into three sections containing twenty mantras.</p>
			<p>Three sages—Pippalāda, Aṅgiras and Sanatkumāra—approach the venerable Atharvaṇa and seek instructions from him on meditation. Atharvaṇa teaches them meditation on Om or Praṇava which is the best symbol for Brahman, both in its higher and in its lower aspects. The three parts of Om, viz., <em>a, u</em> and <em>m</em>, as also the last unseen part, are described as representing the various aspects and levels of creation. For instance, <em>a</em> represents the earth, the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, Brahmā and the deities known as Vasus. It also represents the gāyatrī metre and the gārhapatya fire. Similarly, <em>u</em> stands for the intervening space between the earth and heaven, the <em>Yajurveda</em>, Rudra, and the eleven subsi-diary deities also called Rudras, as also the triṣṭubh metre and the dakṣiṇa fire. The syllable <em>m</em> indicates heaven, the <em>Sāmaveda</em>, Viṣṇu, the deities called Ādityas, the jagatī metre and the āhavanīya fire. The last unseen half-syllable (&#x2018;ardhamātrā&#x2019;) is the symbol of the <em>Atharvaveda</em>, the &#x2018;saṁvartaka&#x2019; fire that destroys creation at the end of the cycle and the deities called Maruts.</p>
			<p>Meditation on this Praṇava leads to liberation from rebirth.</p>

			<p>This Upaniṣad, as its very name indicates, belongs to the <em>Atharvaveda</em>. It is also called <em>Atharvaśīrṣa Upaniṣad</em>. It is classified under minor Upaniṣads and consists of seven sections in prose.</p>
			<p>The first section describes how the gods went to the svargaloka (heaven) and asked Rudra who he was. He replied that He was the primeval Supreme Person and that whatever existed was He. The gods then, realizing His supremacy, praised Him with their hands raised in adoration. The second and the third sections contain their hymns of praise. The fourth section defines and amplifies some of the epithets used in praising Rudra. The fifth section contains some well-known ṛks of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> and a description of the parts (<em>a, u, m</em>) of Om or Praṇava, including their symbology. The sixth section also contains some well-known mantras of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> and <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda.</em> The last section is a eulogy of the results one gets by a study of this Upaniṣad.</p>

			<word>Atharvaveda</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The most ancient and basic scriptures of Hinduism are known as &#x2018;Vedas.&#x2019; Derived from the root &#x2018;vid&#x2019; (= to know), they represent a vast body of religio-spiritual knowledge transmitted orally from generation to generation over the millennia. Hindu tradition ascribes to the sage Kṛṣṇa-Dvaipāyana, better known as Vyāsa, the systematization and editing of the vast Vedic literature with a view to preserving it for the posterity. He is said to have divided the Vedas into four parts and taught it to his four chief disciples viz., Paila, Vaiśampāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu. These four Vedas have been well-known as <em>Ṛgveda</em>, <em>Yajurveda, Sāma-veda</em> and <em>Atharvaveda</em> (<em>vide Mahābhārata, Ādiparva</em> 60.5; <em>Bhāgavata</em> 12.6.50).</p>
			<p>The <em>Atharvaveda</em>, the last in the series, has also been called by several other names: <em>Atharvaṇaveda, Atharvāṅgirasa, Āṅgirasa, Bhṛgvaṅgirasa, Bhṛgu-vistara, Brahmaveda, Bhaiṣajyaveda</em> and <em>Kṣattraveda</em>.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Atharvan,&#x2019; probably derived from &#x2018;athar,&#x2019; an obsolete word for fire, might mean &#x2018;the priest of fire.&#x2019; So, Atharvan may be the name of an ancient sage who &#x2018;brought down fire from heaven&#x2019; and started the sacrificial rites here.</p>
			<p>In the Hindu mythology, he is descri-bed as a son of Brahmā, the Creator, who introduced fire-rituals with soma and other materials. He is identified with Aṅgiras and also called Atharvāṅgirasa. It is also possible that the ṛṣis of the clans of Atharvan, Aṅgiras, Bhṛgu, Atharvāṅgirasa and Brahman were the &#x2018;draṣṭāras&#x2019; of this Veda, i.e., the sages to whom the various hymns of this Veda were revealed. Hence the other names of this Veda.</p>
			<p>The title &#x2018;Brahmaveda&#x2019; could have been derived from the fact that it was related to the priest brahmā, the fourth of the four priests, the other three being hotā, adhvaryu and udgātā, connected with the first three Vedas in that order. In a more general sense it can also mean the Veda that helps in the attainment of Brahman.</p>
			<p>The two names &#x2018;Bhaiṣajyaveda&#x2019; and &#x2018;Kṣattraveda&#x2019; have obviously been derived from the subject matter of the Veda which contains quite a bit of material on &#x2018;bhaiṣajya&#x2019; (medicines and treatment) and &#x2018;kṣattra&#x2019; (the warrior-class known as the kṣattriyas).</p>
			<p>The <em>Atharvaveda</em> has some special features because of which it stands a little apart from the other three Vedas, especi-ally the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. It deals more with the things here and now, than the hereafter, and, the sacrifices which are a means to it. Major portion of this Veda is concerned with diseases and their cure, rites for prolonging life, rites for fulfilling one&#x2019;s desires, building construction, trade and commerce, statecraft, penances and propitiatory rites and black-magic, though high philosophical ideas, much nearer to the thought pattern of the Upaniṣads, are also to be found. Even the literary style is more sophisticated. Hence some scholars believe that this work had not been admitted into the comity of Vedic literature for a long time. It was perhaps considered as a &#x2018;scripture of the masses,&#x2019; not fit enough for admission into the &#x2018;elite-group;&#x2019; and its sheer popularity might have forced the leaders of the society into admitting it as the fourth Veda and give its priests also an honourable place in sacrifices.</p>
			<p>For the same reasons, it is opined that this Veda is chronologically posterior to the other three Vedas. Some modern scholars like C. V. Vaidya (<em>vide History of Vedic Literature,</em> p. 156) assign to it, the period 3000 to 2500 B. C. But, Vedic chronology is a rather hazardous subject and it is very difficult to fix the periods precisely.</p>
			<p>From the ancient times, nine śākhās or branches of the <em>Atharvaveda</em> (<em>Saṁhitā</em>) are known to have existed. However, only two of them are extant: Pippalāda and Śaunaka. Of these, it is the latter that is available in a complete form.</p>
			<p>This Veda is divided into four &#x2018;prapāṭhakas,&#x2019; comprising 20 &#x2018;kāṇḍas.&#x2019; Each kāṇḍa is again sub-divided into &#x2018;sūktas&#x2019; and these sūktas, into &#x2018;mantras.&#x2019; The details are as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Prapāṭhakas</td>
					<td>Kāṇḍas</td>
					<td>Sūktas</td>
					<td>Mantras</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I</td>
					<td>1 to 7</td>

					<td>1411</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>This gives us 6077 mantras in 736 sūktas spread over 20 kāṇḍas in 4 prapāṭhakas. However, due to the different methods adopted in grouping or classi-fying, the number of sūktas given by various scholars have varied from 598 to 759. But there is no difference in the number of the mantras.</p>
			<p>The last kāṇḍa, i.e., the 20th, has borrowed heavily (to the tune of 90%) from the <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em>. It is opined that the kāṇdas 19 and 20, sometimes termed &#x2018;Khilakāṇḍa,&#x2019; are later additions to this Veda.</p>
			<p>Coming to the subject matter of the Saṁhitā of this Veda, we find that there is no systematic division of the same in the first twelve kāṇḍas. The last two again, deal with miscellaneous topics. A brief summary of the contents may now be attempted, under eight subject headings:</p>
			<h3>1. Bhaiṣajya Sūktas :</h3>
			<p>These sūktas which deal with disea-ses, their causes and cures, show a remarkable insight into the subject of health sciences. That is why this Veda is considered to be the precursor of <em>Āyurveda</em> or the Science of health and longevity. Sometimes, <em>Āyurveda</em> is listed as an Upaveda or subsidiary of the <em>Atharvaveda</em>. These sūktas contain many prayers for health and longevity. The various names of the parts of the body given here bespeak of an intimate knowledge of human ana-tomy. Several diseases like fever, leuco-derma, leprosy, jaundice, diabetes, dropsy, skin disorders, troubles of the ear, nose and throat, fracture of bones, diseases of the heart and tuberculosis, are mentioned and cures indicated. These diseases are caused by germs, violation of the laws of nature, anger of deities and malevolent spirits and sins committed previously. Apart from medicines and physical remedies, use of chants and charms was also in plenty. A deep knowledge of the herbs and their various medicinal properties can be inferred from many of the mantras.</p>
			<h3>2. Āyuṣya Sūktas :</h3>
			<p>These sūktas contain supplications for longevity and are to be uttered on auspicious occasions like caula (tonsure), upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread), godāna (gifting of cows) and so on. The desire to live the full span of life, viz., 100 years, is often expressed. One of the sūktas (kāṇḍa 17) prescribes the wearing of the &#x2018;rakṣāsūtra&#x2019; (&#x2018;thread of protection&#x2019;) on the body to attain longevity.</p>
			<h3>3. Pauṣṭika Sūktas :</h3>
			<p>Puṣṭi means worldly progress and welfare. These sūktas generally contain prayers for the blessings of deities like the Maruts, Parjanya and others so that there can be good rains and crops, and, works like house-building or agriculture or trade flourish well.</p>
			<h3>4. Ābhicārika Sūktas :</h3>
			<p>If the Pauṣṭika Sūktas are intended to bring prosperity, the Ābhicāraka Sūktas are aimed at destroying or harming enemies who obstruct our progress or try to destroy us. This is said to be achieved by pleasing or appeasing certain deities or spirits and getting one&#x2019;s wishes fulfilled through them. This technique is called &#x2018;yātu&#x2019; or &#x2018;kṛtyā.&#x2019; The number of such sūktas is rather large. Destruction of one&#x2019;s enemies including the lovers of one&#x2019;s spouse, annihilation of evil spirits, mesmerizing others through whom one can get one&#x2019;s desires fulfilled—these are some of the topics dealt with in these sūktas. The word &#x2018;kṛṣṇendrajāla&#x2019; is sometimes used to indicate the type of black-magic rites depicted here. As opposed to this, the auspicious rites described in the Pauṣṭika Sūktas are called &#x2018;śuklendrajāla.&#x2019;</p>
			<h3>5. Prāyaścitta Sūktas :</h3>
			<p>These are concerned mainly with expiatory rites to offset the evil effects that may come as a result of non-perfor-mance or wrong performance of religious rites. Omens foreboding evil and the rites necessary to combat them are also described.</p>
			<h3>6. Strīkarma Sūktas :</h3>
			<p>These sūktas deal mainly with marri-age, love and allied topics. Rites that help in regaining the lost love of one&#x2019;s spouse are also described.</p>
			<h3>7. Rājakarma Sūktas :</h3>
			<p>This section gives an account of the political system that obtained during those days. The king used to be elected by the people. National and social problems used to be discussed by or decided in a &#x2018;samiti&#x2019;, a parliament of the people. The Rājapurohita (Chief Priest of the State) had an enviable place in the affairs of the State. Prayers for victory in war and hymns expressing devotion to the Motherland given here are highly poetic and moving.</p>
			<h3>8. Brahmaṇya Sūktas :</h3>
			<p>These sūktas unfold the nature of Brahman, the Absolute. The philosophical ideas given here form a link between those of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> and of the Upaniṣads.</p>
			<p>God, the Absolute, is designated here by various names such as Kāla, Skambha, Ucchiṣṭa and Vrātya which are rather peculiar to this Veda. From him the whole universe emerges and in him is it established. He is the lord of the whole creation. The universe has evolved out of him, because he willed it thus (<em>vide</em> 19.53.8). The sun is a symbol of his power and is called &#x2018;Rohita,&#x2019; the &#x2018;Red-One&#x2019;. He is identi-fied with God himself. This Absolute is also identified with the Ātman.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Vrātya&#x2019; found in this section has nothing to do with the people who had been without Vedic sacraments, the sense in which the word has been used in the dharmaśāstras. Here it repre-sents Brahman, the Absolute.</p>
			<p>The <em>Atharvaveda Saṁhitā</em> gives us an interesting picture of the society of its times. The land in which the people lived extended from Gāndhāra (Afghanistan) to Magadha and Aṅga (Bihar and Bengal). The varṇa system had been well established. The first three vaṛṇas were called &#x2018;Āryas&#x2019; and the fourth as &#x2018;Śūdras.&#x2019; But people lived in harmony. Kings were powerful. Trade and commerce were prosperous though agriculture was their main stay. There are hints to show that the brāhmaṇas were powerful and had sometimes to face the wrath of the kṣattriya kings. The cow was highly venerated and godāna (gift of cows) was considered highly meritorious. There are references to the Rājasūya sacrifice and wars among kings. The institute of marriage was very similar to that of the Ṛgvedic times; so also the obsequial rites.</p>
			<p>No Āraṇyaka of the <em>Atharvaveda</em> has come to light so far. Only one Brāhmaṇa has been discovered, the <em>Gopatha Brāhmaṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>The three well-known Upaniṣads—the <em>Praśna</em>, the <em>Muṇḍaka</em> and the <em>Māṇḍūkya—</em>belong to this Veda.</p>
			<p>(For details see under the respective titles.)</p>
			<p>In conclusion it can be said that the Atharvaveda forms an important landmark in Vedic literature.</p>

			<p>Atheism of some sort or the other has always existed in Hindu thought. There are clear references to it in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, including the <em> Bhagavadgītā</em>. But, holding atheistic beliefs has never been a bar to remaining within the Hindu fold.</p>
			<p>If the word &#x2018;atheism&#x2019; is interpreted as non-belief in the existence of God, then, even the Vedic systems like the Sāṅkhya-darśana and the Mīmāṁsā-darśana, have to be dubbed as atheistic. But the word, the Sanskrit equivalent of which is &#x2018;nāstikatā,&#x2019; is generally accepted to mean non-acceptance of the authority of the Vedas. In this sense, the three well-known systems of Indian philosophy—Cārvāka, Jaina and Bauddha darśanas—are classed as &#x2018;nāstika.&#x2019;</p>

			<p>&#x2018;Atideśa,&#x2019; the principle of extending or transferring the details of a particular rite to other similar rites, is often resorted to, in Vedic sacrifices. Generally, the model (or archetype) sacrifice which contains all the details, is known as &#x2018;prakṛti&#x2019; and the derived (or ectype) sacrifice as &#x2018;vikṛti.&#x2019; For instance, &#x2018;Iṣu&#x2019; is a vikṛti sacrifice and many of its details are to be adopted by atideśa from its prakṛti, the Śyena.</p>
			<p>Atideśa may be provided by &#x2018;vacana&#x2019; (Vedic text) or &#x2018;nāma&#x2019; (name). When a Vedic text clearly states that the details of the particular sacrifice are to be filled from another already described, the atideśa is by vacana. When two rites have similar names, the details of one have to be derived from the other. For instance, the rite Māsāgnihotra (prescribed as part of Kuṇḍapāyināmayana, another rite) and the more common Agnihotra have similar names. Hence those of the details of Māsāgnihotra which are not mentioned, or, taken for granted, should be adopted by atideśa from the latter. This is atideśa by name.</p>

			<p>Sins (pāpa) and their expiations (prāyaścitta) have been discussed in detail in many of the dharmaśāstras and purāṇas. Among the prāyaścittas often recommended, one class is known as &#x2018;kṛcchras,&#x2019; those which can be performed with difficulty and cause a lot of hardship to the performer. (See <ref>KṚCCHRA</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>Atikṛcchra is a special expiation of this class. This penance, to be observed for twelve days, is said to purify one of all sins except the ones listed under &#x2018;mahāpātakas.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The person who is observing this penance should eat only one morsel of food for the first three days, that too in the mornings. For the next three days he can eat one morsel in the evenings only. During the next three days he is permitted to eat one morsel, provided it is got without asking for it. For the last three days, he should fast completely.</p>
			<p>Some writers like Yājñavalkya, allow a handful of food instead of one morsel only.</p>

			<p>Incest with one&#x2019;s mother, daughter or daughter-in-law is classified as atipātaka and the only expiation is to die by entering into fire.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Vedic sacrifices were the most common aspects of practical religion in the early days of Hindu civilization. Among them, one variety called Somayāga is said to have seven &#x2018;saṁsthās&#x2019; or forms. They are: Agniṣṭoma, Atyagniṣṭoma, Ukthya, Ṣoḍaśin, Vājapeya, Atirātra and Aptoryāma.</p>
			<p>Atirātra, the sixth in this series, derives its name from the fact that its performance extends beyond a day and a night. It is said to be a modification of Agniṣṭoma. Since it is mentioned in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (7.103.7) it can be inferred as a very ancient sacrifice. The chanting of 29 stotras and 29 śastras, (the additional ones being recited in the night in four rounds), offering of six oblations in the night, chanting of the long <em>Āśvinaśastra</em> (comprising 1000 verses) at dawn, sacrificing an ewe to Sarasvatī on the day of pressing the soma juice, offering of puroḍāśa cakes in potsherds to the twin Aśvins—these are some of the essential features of this sacrifice.</p>

			<p>Offsetting the effects of sins through appropriate means is one of the subjects dealt with in the dharmaśāstras and the purāṇas. This can be done either through &#x2018;kṛcchra&#x2019; (penances) or &#x2018;viparyaya&#x2019; (reversal), the latter being adopted against diseases brought about by such sins. One of the several such remedies is &#x2018;Atirudra.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The eleven stanzas of the <em>Taittirīya Saṁhitā</em> (4.5) beginning with the words &#x2018;namas te rudra manyava&#x2019; are popularly called <em>Rudrādhyāya</em> or just <em>Rudra</em>. Reciting the <em>Rudra</em> once is called &#x2018;āvartana.&#x2019; Reciting it eleven times is called &#x2018;Ekādaśinī.&#x2019; If the Ekādaśinī is repeated eleven times, it is called &#x2018;Laghurudra.&#x2019; Eleven repetitions of the Laghurudra constitute the &#x2018;Mahārudra&#x2019; and eleven Mahārudras, the &#x2018;Atirudra,&#x2019; making it 14,641 repetitions of the <em>Rudra</em>. Mahā-rudra and Atirudra are generally done by employing 11 or 121 brāhmaṇas.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In all cultured and refined societies, honouring a guest is considered as an important duty of a householder. The Hindu scriptures have extolled a guest as God himself (<em>vide Taittirīya Upaniṣad</em> 1.11). Out of the five daily sacrifices (pañcamahāyajñas) a householder is ordained to perform, mānuṣa-yajña the fourth one, concerns the feeding and the taking care of guests.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;atithi&#x2019; has been variously defined. The literal meaning is: &#x2018;one who comes suddenly as a guest without any regard to the &#x201c;tithi&#x201d; (a day of the lunar calendar).&#x2019; Sometimes the word is defined as referring to any unknown person who arrives in the evening seeking food and shelter for the night.</p>
			<p>The master of the house was expected to meet the guest, welcome him, wash his feet and honour him by giving a seat. Waving a lamp before him, giving food and other things he may need to appease his hunger and thirst, and objects like a bed to rest were also recommended.</p>
			<p>Brahmacārins and saṁnyāsins as also learned brāhmaṇas of pure character got precedence over others. Honouring them and feeding them were considered extremely meritorious.</p>
			<p>When the guests left, the master of the household was expected to see them off by going part of the way with them.</p>
			<p>If heretics and sinners came as guests, they were not be entertained. However, out of human consideration, they could be given uncooked food articles.</p>

			<p>After death, a jīva (individual soul), depending upon its karma, takes anyone of these three courses: immediate rebirth, pitṛloka (world of manes) and Satyaloka or Brahmaloka (the world of Brahmā). Journey to either of the last two worlds involves passing through some intermediate stations like arcis (light), ahas (day), āpūryamāṇa-pakṣa (the bright fortnight) and so on. Though these appear to be physical realities, they really represent &#x2018;ātivāhikas,&#x2019; the deities or divine guides who lead the jīva to the next destination in its onward journey.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820), the doyen of Advaita Vedānta, has composed three types of works: bhāṣyas, prakaraṇas and stotras. The bhāṣyas are his commentaries on the prasthānatraya (the three basic works of Vedānta viz., Upaniṣads, <em>Brahmasūtras</em> and <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>). The stotras are devotional hymns. The prakaraṇas are elementary treatises on Advaita philosophy. Out of nearly 40 prakaraṇas attributed to him <em>Ātmabodha</em> is one of the smaller works. It consists of 68 verses.</p>
			<p>As the very name suggests, the work deals with Self-knowledge. After describing briefly the qualifications of an aspirant for mokṣa, the work proceeds to assert that only jñāna (knowledge) can give mokṣa (liberation) directly, even as it is the fire that is directly responsible for cooking food. This is followed by a descrip-tion of the world as &#x2018;mithyā&#x2019; or transient. Then comes an analysis of the three śarīras (bodies) and the five kośas (sheaths) to prove that the ātman is different from all these. The process of meditation on the ātman comprising the three well-known steps of śravaṇa (hearing), manana (reflection) and nididhyāsana (meditation) comes next. It ends with the description of the identity of the jīva (individual soul) with Brahman (Supreme Self), and the state of a liberated soul.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu social legislators considered the life of man as an integral unit and prescribed several saṁskāras or sacraments to purify him in all aspects. However, these saṁskāras should not be performed mechanically but with due faith so that the eight general virtues called &#x2018;ātmaguṇas&#x2019; can be induced in him. They are: sarvabhūtadayā (compassion towards all creatures), kṣānti (forbearance), anasūyatā (absence of jealousy), śauca (purity), anāyāsa (avoiding exertion), maṅgala (auspiciousness), akārpaṇya (large-heartedness) and aspṛhatā (absence of covetousness).</p>
			<p>This list of eight ātmaguṇas differs from author to author. Other virtues included in such lists are: satya (truth), ārjava (straightforwardness), dāna (giving gifts), ahiṁsā (non-injury), śama (peace of mind), dama (self-control) and dhṛti (courage).</p>
			<p>The <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (8.7) has listed eight guṇas or qualities natural to the Ātman as follows: He is apahata-pāpmā (free from sins), vijara (free from decrepitude), vimṛtyu (deathless), viśoka (without sorrow), vijighatsa (free from hunger), apipāsa (free from thirst), satyakāma (of unfailing desires), and satyasaṅkalpa (of unfailing will).</p>

			<p>Ātmahatyā or suicide has been consi-dered a great sin by the dharmaśāstras (<em>vide Parāśara Smṛti</em> 4.1 and 2; <em>Yama Smṛti</em> 20 and 21). Though it was prescribed as the ultimate punishment for sinners of most heinous crimes (<em>Manusmṛti</em> 11.90, 91; <em>Gautama Dharmasūtras</em> 23.1), it was also disapproved by other writers.</p>
			<p>However, it was permitted as a religious act under certain circumstances like a vānaprastha (forest hermit) suffering from incurable diseases and unable to perform his duties, an old man incapable of taking care of himself due to serious old-age decrepitude or illness beyond cure, a householder who has fulfilled all his duties and obligations and has no desire to live and so on.</p>
			<p>Such suicides were committed in various ways such as fasting unto death, mahāprasthāna (See <ref>MAHĀPRASTHĀNA</ref> for details.), drowning oneself at the Triveṇī in Prayāga (modern Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh) or burning oneself in the fire prepared out of cowdung-cakes.</p>

			<p>Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa while describing his descent into the human form uses this word (<em>vide Bhagavadgītā</em> 4.6). Though he is unborn, eternal and the Lord of all beings, he takes recourse to his &#x2018;prakṛti&#x2019; and incarnates himself through &#x2018;ātma-māyā,&#x2019; to re-establish and preserve dharma or righteousness, by destroying the wicked and protecting the good. Prakṛti comprising the three guṇas, sattva, rajas and tamas, is the basic matrix out of which the whole universe is evolved. It is also called māyā which is variously interpreted as illusion, illusory or mysterious power and so on. The incarnation of God is not like the rebirth of ordinary jīvas or beings who are forced into birth and suffering due to their past karma or deeds. He does it out of his free will exercising his mysterious power, which is inherent in Him. This is &#x2018;ātma-māyā.&#x2019;</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The phenomena of birth and death have always mystified man. Whether there is &#x2018;something&#x2019; before birth and whether it survives death has been an eternal question haunting human minds. Most of the Indian philosophical systems have accep-ted the existence of such a spirit, generally termed &#x2018;ātman,&#x2019; though views about it have varied greatly.</p>
			<p>In the early Vedic literature the word &#x2018;ātman&#x2019; has rarely been used. Even when used (<em>vide Ṛgveda</em> 1.115.1) it does not seem to have any mystical or metaphysical significance as found in the later literature. From a simple notion of cosmic unity, the word gradually came to represent the entity which is both immanent and transcendent with regard to the cosmos.</p>
			<p>The term &#x2018;ātman&#x2019; has been derived and defined in various ways: that which animates; that which pervades; that which experiences; that which exists always. A fuller development of the concept is found in the later Vedic literature such as the Āraṇyakas and the Upaniṣads. Here, together with the word &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019; it has been used to denote the Cosmic Spirit both in its transcendent and in its immanent aspects. However, gradually, the word &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019; came to be used much more to indicate the transcendent Reality whereas the term &#x2018;ātman&#x2019; was generally confined to the immanent Reality or the individual self.</p>
			<p>Descriptions of the nature of the ātman or the soul as given by the various schools of Indian philosophy differ widely from one another. The Cārvāka (material-istic) schools deny the existence of a permanent soul and attribute consciousness to the chemical reactions brought about by the combination of the pañca-bhūtas or the five fundamental elements constituting the world. Jainism believes in the existence of eternal souls, infinite in number. They possess consciousness which is limited in manifestation but capable of evolving to infinite proportions. Buddhism, while denying the existence of a permanent soul, accepts the continuity of life which generates the next life as one tree produces another through its seed.</p>
			<p>The Nyāya system admits of the existence of &#x2018;ātman,&#x2019; an eternal soul, different from the body, the senses and the mind. It is vibhu or all-pervading and has consciousness, not as integral to it, but as an adventitious attribute brought about by its association with the mind. It is an agent of action and suffers its consequences. Due to mithyā-jñāna or false knowledge or ignorance, it allows itself to be swayed by the impulses of rāga (attachment), dveṣa (dislike) and moha (infatuation). Consequently it performs good or bad actions and suffers their results. It attains apavarga or liberation by tattvajñāna or right knowledge of the Reality. In this state it is freed from all sorrow, suffering and misery. It is a negative state of transcendence of duḥkha (pain, suffering) and not a positive state of bliss as some others deem to think. And, the ātmans are infinite in number.</p>
			<p>The Vaiśeṣika view is practically identical with that of the Nyāya school.</p>
			<p>The Sāṅkhya and the Yoga systems accept the ātman as an indubitable reality, which they call as &#x2018;puruṣa.&#x2019; The puruṣa is eternal, pure and all-pervading consciousness. He gets into the bondage of saṁsāra (transmigratory existence) due to aviveka or non-discrimination between himself and prakṛti (nature). By viveka-khyāti or knowledge that distinguishes him from the prakṛti, the non-self, he recovers his original state of freedom, freedom from pain and suffering. It is not a state of joy or bliss.</p>
			<p>These systems also concede that the puruṣas are innumerable.</p>
			<p>The views of the Mīmāṁsā school regarding the ātman or the soul, are very similar to those of the preceding four systems mentioned here. The ātman is an eternal, infinite substance which is related to a real body in a real world. It survives death to be able to reap the consequences of its action performed here. Consciousness is not its essence but only an adventitious quality which arises when some conditions are present. There are as many souls as there are individuals. Liberation is obtained by the disinterested performance of obligatory actions, knowledge of the ātman and the wearing out of the karmas accumulated in the past. Total stoppage of rebirth and remaining in a state beyond pleasure and pain is the special charac-teristic of liberation.</p>
			<p>The Vedānta system has branched off into three main schools—Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita.</p>
			<p>The Advaita school maintains that the ātman is eternal, infinite and is of the nature of pure consciousness. It is, in the ultimate analysis, Brahman the Absolute Itself. Ajñāna or the ignorance of its real nature has led to its bondage and jñāna or knowledge will lead it to liberation. This is not a state to be attained but the original state itself regained. In this state it will enjoy unalloyed bliss.</p>
			<p>The Viśiṣṭādvaita school declares that the ātman or the soul, though eternal, is not vibhu (infinite) but aṇu (atomic) in size. Consciousness is intrinsic to it, though its contraction and expansion are possible. Such souls are infinite in number. They are different from Brahman or God, but parts of it. Liberation is attained by bhakti or devotion to God. In this state the souls become similar to God but not absolutely identical with him.</p>
			<p>According to the Dvaita school, the soul is eternal, atomic in size and has consciousness as its essence. The souls are innumerable, different from God and from one another too. They are of three classes: those that are bound but may become liberated; those that are eternally confined to transmigratory existence and those that are doomed permanently to the misery of hell. Liberation is obtained by knowledge, devotion to Viṣṇu, and by his grace. It is living in Vaikuṇṭha, the world of God, in his eternal presence. Even in the state of liberation differences among the liberated souls persist.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;discrimination between the Self and the non-Self&#x2019;)</note>

		<description>
			<p>The Vedānta system of Indian philo-sophy considers the Brahman/Ātman Principle as the only or the Supreme Reality. All other things, perceived or unperceived, are its manifestations, or, ever subservient to it. The primary purpose of life is to realize this Reality as our true Self. But, all efforts at doing so are being negated by our inordinate attachment to our body-mind complex. Hence this attachment is to be attenuated and ultimately got rid of by sādhana-catuṣṭaya or the fourfold discipline. Ātmānātma-viveka heads this list. It consists in separation (viveka) of the ātman (Self) from all that is anātman (not-Self). The body, the sense-organs, the vital airs, the mind, the intellect, the egoity—none of these is the ātman and hence fit to be brushed aside. Such discrimination and logical thinking gradually leads to the next higher modes of sādhanā and ultimately to the direct experience of the ātman.</p>

			<p>This is a small Upaniṣad belonging to the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. The first part is in prose and the rest in verses.</p>
			<p>The prose version appears like a condensation of the <em>Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> and deals with the supremacy of Nārāyaṇa and the aṣṭākṣarī (eight-syllabled) mantra.</p>
			<p>The rest of the text describes the subjective experience of the jīvanmukta or the liberated being. He has transcended māyā and has realized his identity with the inmost Self. Hence he is beyond the three guṇas and the codes of conduct that bind the ignorant ones. He is ever pure infinite consciousness and the spirit sought after by the scriptures. All the beings and all the objects of creation exist in him even as the bubbles and the waves exist in the ocean. Being ever blissful in nature, no sorrow or suffering will ever touch him. Unfortunately the ignorant people of the world are not aware of their true nature even as the owl is not aware of the brilliant light of the sun.</p>

			<p><em>Ahirbudhnya Saṁhitā</em> is an important text of the Pāñcarātra school of Vaiṣṇava Āgamas. According to it, union of the jīvātman with Paramātman is the ultimate goal of life. This can be achieved either through &#x2018;ātmasamarpaṇa&#x2019; (also called &#x2018;hṛdyāga&#x2019;) or through &#x2018;yoga.&#x2019; Meditation on God in the form of some of his powers as deities (as for instance, the Sudarśana-cakra, the discus-weapon of Viṣṇu) with appropriate mantras culminating in total self-offering or self-abnegation is &#x2018;ātma-samarpaṇa.&#x2019; &#x2018;Yoga&#x2019; is very similar to the process taught by Patañjali in his <em>Yogasūtras</em>.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Indian philosophical systems have recognised &#x2018;tarka&#x2019; or ratiocination as an important aspect of the mental process which helps us to determine the truth and to counter the arguments of the opponents. The latter is a necessary component of the former.</p>
			<p>While countering the arguments of the opponents, the fallacies in their arguments have to be pointed out. Five such fallacies have been listed: ātmāśraya (self-dependence), anyonyāśraya (mutual dependence), cakraka (circle), anavasthā (vicious infinite) and pramāṇa-bādhitār-thaka-prasaṅga (contradictory experience).</p>
			<p>Ātmāśrayatva, the first of these, has been defined as that undesirable state in which something is dependent only on itself. This can happen in three different ways depending upon whether we are trying to explain &#x2018;utpatti&#x2019; or origination, &#x2018;vṛtti&#x2019; or functioning and &#x2018;jñapti&#x2019; or know-ledge.</p>
			<p>If X is the product of X, then X, the cause could not be present at the instant of time before the one at which X the product came into existence. The principle of causality requires that the cause should precede the product in time. Hence to say that X is the product of the same X is a fallacy.</p>
			<p>If X is a function of X, then the cause X must have a larger extension than the function X. But here, being the same thing, the two are coextensive. Hence, to say that X is a function of X (which is identical with the cause X) is a fallacy.</p>
			<p>If X is not different from the knowing of X, then, it would be a product of the constituents of knowing and hence be different from X, which is obviously a fallacy.</p>
			<p>In all these cases, that which is sought to be proved, depends upon the very same object, and hence a fallacy.</p>

			<p>A small Upaniṣad belonging to the <em>Atharvaveda</em> with just three sections in prose, it deals with three kinds of &#x2018;puruṣas&#x2019; or beings, called &#x2018;ātmā&#x2019;. The first is the physical body comprising the various limbs and subject to birth and death. It is the &#x2018;bāhyātmā&#x2019; or the outer ātman. The second, called &#x2018;antarātmā,&#x2019; the inner ātman, is the mind composed of the sūkṣma-bhūtas or the subtle elements and responsible for the functions of the senses as also the various states like thinking, feeling and willing. The third and the last is the &#x2018;paramātmā&#x2019; or the &#x2018;puruṣa,&#x2019; the Supreme Self or the Person. He is the true Self who is subtler than the subtlest, beyond all change and destruction, the eternally pure witness of all, the infinite, the indestructible.</p>
			<p>Some texts contain an additional part in verses numbering 31, describing this Ātman-Brahman, the unreal nature of the manifested world and the state of liberation of the emancipated being.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Derived from the word &#x2018;Atri,&#x2019; the term &#x2018;Ātreya&#x2019; can refer to anyone who is a descendant of the sage Atri. There are several sages that bear this name. The <em>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</em> (8.22) mentions one sage Udamaya, an Ātreya, as a priest of the king Aṅga Vairocana. The <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> (2.6.3; 4.6.3) has included the name of one Ātreya, a disciple of Māṇṭi, as one of the teachers of <em>Madhuvidyā</em>. In the <em>Mahābhārata</em> we come across an Ātreya who was a disciple of the sage Vāmadeva. He acted as one of the priests in the Sarpayāga conducted by Janamejaya. It was he who taught spiritual wisdom to Vidura.</p>
			<p>Ātreya Punarvasu is one of the earliest and well-known teachers of Āyurveda (science of longevity). He has sometimes been identified with Suśruta.</p>
			<p>Ātreya Rāmānuja (A. D. 1220-1295), also known as Kiḍāmbi Appuḷḷār, is an important teacher of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of Vedānta. He imbibed both the Sanskrit and the Tamil traditions of the school and taught them to his nephew, Vedānta Deśika (A. D. 1268-1369) another doyen of this school. He was well-versed in the Mīmāṁsā as well as the Vedānta systems of philosophy. <em>Nyāyakuliśa</em>, is his <em>magnum opus</em>. Other works attributed to him are: <em>Divyasūriprabhavadīpikā, Sarva-darśana-śiromaṇi</em> and <em>Mokṣasiddhi</em>.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Atri is a well-known ṛṣi or sage often mentioned in the sacred literature of the Hindus. The fifth maṇḍala of the <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> mentions Atri and Ātreyas (descendants of Atri) as the ṛṣis through whom it was revealed. His name occurs in other places also (ibid 10.137.4).</p>
			<p>Atri is one of the ten mind-born sons (&#x2018;mānasaputras&#x2019;) of Brahmā the Creator, and classified as a &#x2018;maharṣi&#x2019; (great sage). Hence he is one of the Prajāpatis or progenitors of mankind too. He is said to have protected the sun against the eclipse-demon, Svarbhānu, (the Rāhu of post-Vedic mythology) by composing a &#x2018;Fourth&#x2019; prayer, the other three being the usual liturgy of prayers against an eclipse. He is also said to have been the purohita or priest of the pañcajanas (five clans or tribes of the Vedic Āryans). He was tortured by the Asuras (demons) but protected and rescued by the Aśvins (the twin deities).</p>
			<p>He is listed among the Saptarṣis or the Seven Sages. Astral myths refer to him as one of the stars of the Saptarṣimaṇḍala or the constellation of the Great Bear.</p>
			<p>Atri&#x2019;s wife was Anasūyā (lit., &#x2018;one who has no jealousy&#x2019;), the daughter of Kardama Prajāpati. She was the paragon of wifely virtues and chastity. Pleased by the austerities of Atri, Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva were born in Anasūyā as Atri&#x2019;s sons: Candra, Datta or Dattātreya and Durvāsas.</p>
			<p>Rāma, while living in the forest Daṇḍaka, visited his hermitage and learnt about the secrets of dharma (<em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>,<em> Araṇyakāṇḍa,</em> 117) from him.</p>
			<p>Ancient writers on dharmaśāstras have held Atri in high esteem. <em>Manusmṛti</em> (3.16) and <em>Mahābhārata</em> (<em>Anuśāsanaparva</em> 65.1) have quoted his views. There is an <em>Ātreya Dharmaśāstra</em> attributed to him. It is in nine chapters and treats of dāna (gifts), japya (prayers) and tapas (austerities).</p>
			<p>There are several other works styled &#x2018;Atri Smṛti&#x2019; or &#x2018;Atri Saṁhitā&#x2019; in manuscripts. One <em>Atri Saṁhitā</em> now available in print, contains 400 verses and deals with most of the topics generally dealt with in the dharmaśāstras.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Saṁnyāsa or monastic life is the last of the four āśramas or stages of life through which every dvija (&#x2018;the twice-born&#x2019;) has to pass. Generally every pious dvija entertains the desire of dying as a saṁnyāsin, since that enhances his chance of mokṣa or liberation which is the ultimate goal of human life.</p>
			<p>Life being uncertain, situations may so arise in life that a man may die without taking saṁnyāsa. For such persons afflic-ted with mortal diseases or facing grave dangers, the dharmaśāstras have provided an emergency ritual by which they can take saṁnyāsa and hence die as saṁnyāsins. This is called &#x2018;ātura-saṁnyāsa.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The essentials of this ritual are: saṅkalpa (resolve to take saṁnyāsa), kṣaura (tonsure of the head), sāvitrī-praveśa (merging the Gāyatrī mantra into praṇava or Om) and praiṣoccāra (uttering the praiṣamantra, signifying renunciation).</p>
			<p>Even among these, the first and the last are enough if there is no scope for performing the other aspects of the ritual.</p>
			<p>If by chance, a person who has taken āturasaṁnyāsa survives the ordeal, he is expected to take regular saṁnyāsa with all the formalities. He cannot go back to the old way of life.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The sage Kaṇāda is the founder of the Vaiśeṣika system of philosophy, one of the six systems of Indian Philosophy. Since he lived upon the grains picked up from the agricultural fields, (kaṇa = grain, ad = to eat) he came to be known as &#x2018;Kaṇāda.&#x2019; It is said that he performed severe austerities to get the grace of Śiva. Pleased with his devotion and faith, Śiva appeared before him in the form of an &#x2018;ulūka&#x2019; (an owl) and taught him this philosophy. Hence Kaṇāda&#x2019;s Vaiśeṣika Darśana is also known as &#x2018;Aulūkya-darśana,&#x2019; the philosophy revealed by Śiva in the form of Ulūka or owl. Traditional writers of Indian Philosophical systems generally refer to the Vaiśeṣika school as &#x2018;Kaṇāda-darśana&#x2019; or &#x2018;Aulūkya-darśana.&#x2019;</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Among the saṁskāras or sacraments enumerated by the ancient writers on the dharmaśāstras, like Gautama, four vedavratas are important (<em>vide Gautama Dharmasūtras</em> 8.15). They are: mahā-nāmnī-vrata, mahā-vrata, upaniṣad-vrata (or aupa-niṣada-vrata) and godāna-vrata. Each of these vratas had to be observed by the brahmacārin (celibate student of the Vedas) for a year each.</p>
			<p>Other works like the <em>Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhyasūtras</em> (2.11-12) describe these four vratas as śukriya, śākvara, vrātika and aupaniṣada. They are the vratas that precede the study of the different sections of the Vedas.</p>
			<p>The aupaniṣada-vrata precedes the study of the Upaniṣad part of the Vedas.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of each of these vratas there has to be a separate upa-nayana ceremony involving the wearing of the new yajñopavīta (sacred thread), new deer-skin and new girdle. The vrata lasts for one year.</p>
			<p>Failure to observe these vratas or lapses during their performance had to be expiated with appropriate prāyaścittas specially prescribed. The observance of these vratas seems to have been gradually given up.</p>

			<p>In ancient and medieval India, the dvijas (&#x2018;twice-born&#x2019; ones), especially the brāhmaṇa householders, were expected to maintain the śrauta or the Vedic fires in which they had to offer Agnihotra everyday. Those who had thus established duly consecrated sacred fires were called &#x2018;āhitāgnis.&#x2019; However, even those who had not done so, had to offer Agnihotra twice everyday. This was done in the fire kindled at the time of marriage and maintained thereafter. This fire was known by several names: aupasada, aupāsana, āvasathya, vaivāhika, smārta, gṛhya or śālā-agni.</p>

			<p>Since the most ancient times, the Hindu society has attached great importance to sons born of wedlock. They are believed to take care of their parents not only here but also hereafter. Performing śrāddha or obsequial rites which will help sustain the dead ancestors, has been considered as important as taking care of them here and now.</p>
			<p>Among the twelve kinds of sons described in the smṛtis (<em>vide Manusmṛti</em> 9.159-160) the &#x2018;aurasa&#x2019; stands first. He is the son born of the wife of the same caste married as per the rules given in the dharmaśāstras. He alone has the right to the father&#x2019;s property and to the performance of the śrāddha rites.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Sri Aurobindo (1872—1950) is one of the bright stars of the modern Indian firmament who has left behind him a legacy, a philosophy and an institution. Born on the 15th August 1872 as the last son of Dr. Krishna Dhan Ghosh and Swarnalata Devi at Konnagar of West Bengal, he had his early education at the Loretto Convent School of Darjeeling. After two years, in 1879, he was taken, along with his two elder brothers, to England for further education. He lived there for 14 years, his early coaching being under Mr. and Mrs. Drewett. He had his higher education at the St. Paul&#x2019;s School of London and King&#x2019;s College at Cambridge. He became an adept not only in English but also in the classical European languages like Greek and Latin, as also French, Italian and German. Though he passed the open competition for the Indian Civil Service (I. C. S.) in 1890, he failed to complete it since he felt no call for it. During this period he had already become well acquainted with the political upheaval in India as also the atrocities of the alien British government on the Indians.</p>
			<p>Returning to India in 1893 he accep-ted service under the Maharaja of Baroda in which he continued till 1906, one year after the partition of Bengal. All along he had kept in touch with the political movement and had proved to be a source of inspiration for the young revolution-aries. His writings in the papers like the <em>Jugantar, Induprakāśa</em> and <em>Bande Mātaram</em> being of a highly provocative nature, attracted the evil eye of the British government. His call for boycotting the foreign goods, substituting national schools for the government institutions, creation of arbitration courts for people and attempts at forming the nucleus of a national army added to his problems with the government. He was finally arrested in 1908 in what is now well-known as the Māṇiktala Bomb Case and was in jail for a year, before being acquitted.</p>
			<p>Right from 1904 he had been taking deep interest in the practice of yoga. In 1908 he received some help and guidance from Sri Lele, a Mahratta Yogi. While in jail, he has stated, that he had some mystic experiences like hearing the voice of Vivekananda instructing him on some aspects of yoga.</p>
			<p>He started two weeklies, <em>Karmayogin</em> (in English) and <em>Dharma</em> (in Bengali) which had a fairly large circulation. Meanwhile his association with politics including the Indian National Congress continued. However, a strong inner urge made him take a sudden decision to depart for Chandernagore, a French settlement, leaving the editing of the <em>Karmayogin</em> in the hands of Sister Nivedita, with whom he had a very close acquaintance. He later shifted to Pondicherry in 1910 where he lived till he breathed his last, on the 5th December, 1950.</p>
			<p>In Pondicherry he totally dedicated himself to yogasādhanā and guiding the earnest souls that started gathering round him. Thus, in course of time, an Ashrama grew around him. Mrs. Mira Richards, a French admirer, later known as the Mother, who had come into contact with him in 1914, started living there and took over the management of the Ashrama by 1922.</p>
			<p>Sri Aurobindo was a prolific writer too. <em>Sāvitrī</em>, a long poem of 24,000 lines in blank verse, is his <em>magnum opus</em>. He has delineated his philosophy in another great work, <em>The Life Divine</em>. <em>Essays on the Gītā, The Synthesis of Yoga</em> and <em>The Secret of the Vedas</em> are some of his other notable works.</p>
			<p>His teaching is that behind the appearances of the universe, there is the Reality of a Being and Consciousness, the Self of all beings and things. This Being is involved here in matter. Evolution is the method by which it liberates itself. Life is the first step of this release of consciousness. Mind is the second. The next step of evolution must be towards the development of Supermind and Spirit as the dominant power in the conscious being. Man has to exert himself consciously to evolve to this level. The ancient psychological discipline and practice of yoga is the method. This will help the descent of the higher, supernatural, principle into the mind. Then the One Self is discovered in all and the supramental consciousness transforms and divinises the human nature.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Son of the sage Cyavana (a descendant of Bhṛgu) and Āruṣi (daughter of Manu), Aurva got this name since he was born from the ūru or the thigh of his mother. Once, the kṣattriyas belonging to the race of Kārtavīryārjuna were harassing the ṛṣis who were descendants of Bhṛgu, including the womenfolk. As a result of the tension and fear, the foetus in the womb of Āruṣi slipped into her thigh and was born out of it. The child—ṛṣi Aurva—stared at the marauders making them blind. They regained their sight by praying to the child-sage.</p>
			<p>Later on, the sage Aurva engaged himself in a sacrifice aimed at destroying the followers of Kārtavīryārjuna. He was however dissuaded from doing so. In the process Aurva discharged his anger into the sea, in the form of a horse. This submarine fire came to be known as &#x2018;Vaḍavāgni.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Aurva had two children: Ṛcīka (son) and Kandalī (daughter).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting from the Vedic times, the importance of the body in our life, whether secular or sacred, has been duly recognised. It is only a strong and healthy body that can serve our purpose best. This naturally led to the development of Āyurveda (life-science or health-science).</p>
			<p>Treatment of diseases and improving the general stamina form a salient aspect of Āyurveda. Medicines or drugs used for such treatment have been given the general name, &#x2018;auṣadha.&#x2019; Derived from the word &#x2018;oṣadhi&#x2019; (plant, herb), it means a &#x2018;preparation made of plants and herbs.&#x2019; However in practice, it refers to all medicines whether derived out of herbs, animal products or minerals.</p>
			<p>Āyurveda has developed its own methods of pharmacy. It aims at retaining the medical properties of the ingredients of drugs with the necessary modification brought about by dilution, heating, emulsi-fication, clarification, impregnation and other means.</p>
			<p>The auṣadhas are generally compounded with bases like ghṛta (ghee), taila (oil), water and milk. They may be administered as kaṣāya (decoction) guṭikā (pills), modaka (uncooked pills), cūrṇa (powder), kalka (paste of plant), leha or lehya (thick plant extracts with sugar to be taken by licking), ariṣṭa (fermented drink) and so on.</p>

			<p>Avabhṛtha is the final purificatory bath marking the end of Somayāga. This is an &#x2018;iṣṭi,&#x2019; a rite needing four priests. After a number of preliminary rites in the yāga-śālā (sacrificial shed), the yajamāna or sacrificer and his wife proceed to a flowing river or any reservoir, along with the priests, for the final bath and disposal of the utensils used in the sacrifice, as also other objects like the antelope skin and yoktra (cord of muñja grass worn by the wife). The utensils are smeared with the soma juice before disposal. The rite itself takes place in water, a handful of kuśa grass thrown on the water serving as the āhavanīya fire for that purpose. A special sāman called avabhṛtha-sāman, is chanted during the rite.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;avabhṛtha-snāna&#x2019; is also used to indicate the ceremonial bath at the conclusion of any major religious rite like the consecration of a new temple.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;theory of limitation&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the Advaita Vedānta Brahman, the Absolute is one, without a second. The jīvas or the individual souls, though apparently limited and many, are Brahman itself, in the ultimate analysis. How the One becomes or appears as the many is metaphysically indefinable. But it is, however, describable figuratively or analogically. The two well-known theories that have successfully attempted this are: bimba-pratibimba-vāda, also called pratibimba-vāda (&#x2018;theory of reflection&#x2019;) and avacchedavāda (&#x2018;theory of limitation&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>According to the former theory, māyā and avidyā act like reflecting media. When Brahman is reflected in māyā, it becomes Īśvara; when reflected in avidyā, it becomes the jīvas. Though the reflected images (called &#x2018;pratibimba&#x2019;) are affected by the media, the original (called &#x2018;bimba&#x2019;) is not. Also, when one reflected image is affected by the changes in the particular medium, other reflections may not be so affected. This explains the different condi-tions of the different jīvas though <em>all</em> the jīvas are reflections of the same Brahman. When the reflecting media are done away with, the reflections too disappear, leaving only the original intact. This view was propounded mainly by Padmapāda (A. D. 820) and his successors and is one of the characteristic features of the Vivaraṇa School.</p>
			<p>In the latter theory, propounded by the Bhāmatī School, when Brahman the Absolute, appears to be limited by māyā, it becomes Īśvara; when limited by avidyā, it becomes the jīvas. A classic example for this limitation theory is the sky or space (ākāśa) and containers like a pot. Though space is unlimited, it appears to be limited by a pot or a room or a house. On the destruction of these limiting adjuncts, space &#x2018;regains&#x2019; its original status.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;avadhūta,&#x2019; often met with in the Hindu religious literature, generally refers to a perfect man, also called a &#x2018;paramahaṁsa&#x2019; or an &#x2018;ativarṇāśramin.&#x2019; The <em>Bhāgavata</em> (skandha 11, chapters, 7, 8 and 9) mentions an avadhūta who had twentyfour teachers. The list includes the pañcabhūtas or the five elements, animals like elephant and deer, and human beings like a maiden and a child. He says that he learnt a lesson each, from each of them through careful observations.</p>
			<p>The <em>Avadhūtagītā</em>, a work ascribed to Avadhūta Dattātreya, gives a description of the characteristics of an avadhūta, based on the four syllables—a, va, dhū and ta (8.5-9): He is free from desires. Ever pure, he lives in bliss. His speech is faultless. He has no body-consciousness. His mind is ever absorbed in Brahman and hence he has no need to practise meditation. He is totally free from egoism and ignorance.</p>
			<p>Avadhūta Dattātreya has been mentioned in several Upaniṣads.</p>
			<p>In a more restricted sense, the term &#x2018;avadhūta&#x2019; is applied to the senior Nāgā sādhus of the daśanāmī orders living in holy places like Rishikesh. They may or may not be naked. But they wear matted hair, necklace of rudrākṣa beads or even bones, and are indifferent to rules of observance common to other monastic or religious orders. Several types have been noted among them: Brahma-avadhūta, Śiva-avadhūta, Bhakta-avadhūta and Haṁsa-avadhūta.</p>
			<p>The avadhūtas base their practices on the tantras.</p>
			<p>Female ascetics of this variety are also known to exist and are called &#x2018;avadhūtānīs.&#x2019;</p>

		<description>
			<p>The <em>Avadhūtagītā</em> is one of the 36 minor philosophical poems composed in imitation of the well-known <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>. It is an independent treatise on Advaita Vedānta and preaches an uncompromising non-dualism. Its authorship is attributed to Avadhūta Dattātreya. Hence it is also called <em>Dattagītā</em> or <em>Datta-gītā-yogaśāstra</em>. It is also titled, though rarely, <em>Vedāntasāra</em>.</p>
			<p>This small treatise of 271 verses is divided into 28 chapters. The first chapter deals with the nature of the ātman, which is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent; which has no birth, no death, no bondage and no liberation either. The second deals with the proofs for the same. Duality is born out of ignorance of the real nature of the one Divine. Incidentally, even the great Avadhūta has hinted at the need for a spiritual guide (2.23) in realizing the ātman. The next two chapters deal with the inner nature of the ātman in highly poetical tones. The fifth chapter advises a man to avoid all lamentations, as the ātman is the same in all conditions. The sixth chapter negates all kinds of distinctions whether of caste or family, of senses or their objects, of the mind or the intellect or their activities—because none of these exists when looked at from the standpoint of the ātman. The seventh describes the state of the avadhūta. The eighth gives a definition of the word &#x2018;avadhūta&#x2019; by interpreting each of the four syllables (a, va, dhū, ta) of that word.</p>

			<word>Avadhūta Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is one of the minor Upaniṣads belonging to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em> and classed among the Saṁnyāsa Upaniṣads, i.e., Upaniṣads teaching saṁnyāsa or stressing a life of renunciation. The text is a mixture of prose and poetry and has 36 verses/sections.</p>
			<p>Sāṅkṛti approaches Avadhūta Dattā-treya and questions him thus: &#x2018;Who is an avadhūta? What is his mental state? What are his characteristics? What is saṁsaraṇa?&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Dattātreya replies: &#x2018;An &#x201c;avadhūta&#x201d; is one who has identified himself with the (a =) &#x201c;akṣara&#x201d; or the indestructible Brahman, who is (va =) &#x201c;vareṇya&#x201d; or excellent, who has destroyed all bonds of transmigration (dhū = dhūta-saṁsārabandhana) and has become the goal of the Upaniṣadic sentences like (ta =) &#x201c;tat tvam asi.&#x201d; &#x2019; Since he has already realized the ātman or the Self, there is no need for him of following the rules and regulations of varṇa and āśrama (castes and stages of life). Hence he is also called an &#x2018;ativarṇāśramin&#x2019; (one who has transcended the varṇa-āśrama-system).</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Immortality can be attained by renunciation alone and not by rituals or progeny or wealth.</p>
			<p>&#x2018; &#x201c;Saṁsaraṇa&#x201d; means moving freely among the ignorant people to destroy their ignorance of the Self.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;He may move about stark naked, partially clad or well-clad.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;He sacrifices only to the inner Self and is free from all actions.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Though experiencing objects of senses, he is not tainted by them even as the sun is not tainted by the nature of the objects upon which he shines.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;He is not affected by the desires entering into him even as the ocean does not overflow by the waters of the rivers entering it.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Then follow some verses describing the inner state of the avadhūta: &#x2018;The highest truth is that there is no creation, nor any destruction. There is no sādhaka (spiritual aspirant) nor a mukta (the liberated one). Those interested in progeny or wealth or other things, may engage themselves in action and suffer transmigration. But I am ever filled with bliss. I am not interested even in sleep or begging for food. I have no need for śravaṇa (listening to Vedāntic texts) or manana (reflecting on them) or nidi-dhyāsana (meditation). Let prārabdha karma (results of actions of previous lives) take its own course. Though I am now liberated, there is no harm in my following the path prescribed by the śāstras or scriptures to set an example to the ignorant people. I am ever blessed since I know my Self and the bliss of Brahman is being clearly experienced.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad closes with a phala-śruti (eulogy) of the results that can be obtained if this is studied and realized.</p>

		<description>
			<p>During the Vedic sacrifices, gods have to be invited to come to the yāgaśālā or the sacrificial shed, to receive their share of the offerings. During the śrāddha or obsequial rites, the pitṛs or manes have to be invited to come and receive their offerings. Both these are done with appro-priate mantras. This act of inviting is technically called &#x2018;āvāhana.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Āvāhana is also done during the consecration of an image in a temple. The deity is invoked to come in its subtle form and reside in that image permanently, receiving worship and conferring boons.</p>
			<p>In pūjā or ritualistic worship, āvāhana is considered as one of the upacāras or items of service to honour the deity. The particular mudrā or handpose exhibited during the act is called &#x2018;āvāhanī-mudrā.&#x2019;</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>A Vedic student living in the house of the guru to learn the Vedas and allied sciences was called a &#x2018;brahmacārin.&#x2019; He had to follow a given routine, observe a prescribed code of conduct and keep certain vows. Any violation of these vows, whether intentional or unintentional, had to be atoned by appropriate prāyaścittas or expiatory rites. Violation of the vow of brahmacarya or celibacy was the worst of these. The brahmacārin who wilfully had sexual intercourse with a woman was called an &#x2018;avakīrṇin.&#x2019; The <em>Dharmasūtras</em> of Āpastamba (1.9.26.8) and Vasiṣṭha (23.1-3) as also the <em>Manusmṛti</em> (11.118-121) prescribe that the avakīrṇin should sacrifice an ass to the deity Nirṛti, which is symbolic of the stupid lapse, wear the skin of an ass for one year, should beg his food from seven houses announcing to them his lapse, take food only once in a day and bathe thrice a day. Then only he will become pure. Vasiṣṭha substitutes an oblation of boiled rice for the sacrifice of an ass.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A yajamāna (one who performs a sacrifice) is expected to take dīkṣā or initiation at the beginning of the sacrifice he is undertaking. This is a purificatory ritual which imposes on him certain rules and code of conduct.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, as a part of a major sacrifice, minor rites also will have to be performed. Some of these, considered as very important, require the yajamāna and his wife to take an additional dīkṣā. Such a dīkṣā, taken at the beginning of a subsidiary rite which itself is part of a bigger sacrifice, is called &#x2018;avāntaradīkṣā.&#x2019; For instance in the Agniṣṭoma (a Soma-yāga), avāntaradīkṣā has to be taken before the pravargya rite. The yajamāna and his wife offer fuel sticks into the āhavanīya and gārhapatya fires respectively. Touching the water heated in the vessel called &#x2018;madantī,&#x2019; the yajamāna clenches his fists closely, tightens his girdle and drinks hot milk. The dīkṣā ends with nihnava, a kind of salutation to heaven and earth, by the priests.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A well-known janapada or a country, during the period of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, it was also called Avantikā. It was located in western India in the present Ujjain-Mandhata region of Madhya Pradesh. Divided into two parts, the northern region had Ujjayinī as its capital whereas the capital of the south was Māhiṣmatī (the modern Mandhata). It was being ruled by two brothers Vinda and Anuvinda. They were subdued by Sahadeva, the last of the Pāṇḍava brothers and paid contributions towards the expenses of the Rājasūya sacrifice.</p>
			<p>It is considered to be one of the seven cities (mahāpuṇyanagarīs) that confer great merit on those that dwell in it. It was here that Sāndīpani lived and, Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa were educated. The people of this region were known to be great warriors, being the descendants of Haihayas, the most celebrated of whom was Kārtavīryārjuna. Later on, it became the home of Buddhist and Jaina learning.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Derived from the root &#x2018;vṛ&#x2019; and with a prefix &#x2018;ā,&#x2019; the word &#x2018;āvaraṇa&#x2019; means anything which covers or surrounds. In the Advaita Vedānta it refers to the veiling power of māyā/avidyā. (See <ref>ĀVARAṆA-ŚAKTI.</ref>)</p>
			<p>In temple architecture, it refers to the enclosures or prākāras, surrounding the main shrine, wherein the āvaraṇa-devatās (minor deities, the attendants of the chief deity) are housed, as also the utsavamūrti (procession deity) and other paraphernalia.</p>
			<p>In Vīraśaivism the word is used for a protective covering, in the spiritual sense. There are eight such āvaraṇas. (See <ref>AṢṬĀVARAṆAS</ref>.)</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The garbhagṛha (<em>sanctum sanctorum</em>) of a Hindu temple is generally surrounded by āvaraṇas or enclosures whose number may vary from one to seven. Though the main purpose of these āvaraṇas is to provide space for pradakṣiṇā (circumambu-lation) round the main deity, they also serve to accommodate the images of other deities considered to be the attendants or the retinue of the main deity. These deities are called &#x2018;āvaraṇa-devatās&#x2019; or &#x2018;parivāra-devatās.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The <em>Vaikhānasāgama</em> lists as many as 135 parivāradevatās spread over seven āvaraṇas for a Viṣṇu temple. Brahmā, Aniruddha, Trivikrama, Varuṇa, Śukra, Bṛhaspati, Subhadrā—these are some of the deities listed there.</p>
			<p>In a Śiva temple, Devī, Caṇḍeśvara and Brahmā find a place in the āvaraṇas.</p>
			<p>In a Devī temple, Śiva, Viṣṇu and Gaṇapati will invariably be there. So also Kārttikeya or Subrahmaṇya.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the Advaita Vedānta as propounded by Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) the ultimate Reality is one only, the one without a second—ekam eva advitīyam brahma. But that we perceive this world of multiplicity, is a fact of experience. Śaṅkara attributes this to māyā or avidyā or ajñāna (illusion or nescience or ignorance). This māyā/ avidyā covers this Truth or Brahman and makes it appear as something else which it really is not, viz., the world. For instance, the semidarkness of twilight covers up the real nature of a rope and the semilight projects it as a snake. The power of māyā/avidyā to veil the truth is called &#x2018;āvaraṇaśakti&#x2019; and its power to project it as something else, is called &#x2018;vikṣepaśakti.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Just as bright light destroys the illusory perception of the snake in the rope, even so jñāna, knowledge or direct experience of the Truth (Brahman/Ātman) will destroy this māyā/avidyā.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;related to the dwelling place&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>For performing Vedic sacrifices, duly consecrated fires are needed. The maximum number of such fires is five and they are called &#x2018;pañcāgnis.&#x2019; They are: gārhapatya, āhavanīya, anvāhāryapacana or dakṣiṇa, sabhya and āvasathya.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;āvasathya&#x2019; is derived from &#x2018;āvasatha&#x2019; or a dwelling place. According to one view, the brāhmaṇas and others who were invited to participate in a sacrifice used to be put up in special dwelling places called āvasatha (similar to a modern dharmaśālā) where a fire was to be lit, to ward off cold. This could have been the origin of this fire.</p>
			<p>During Vedic sacrifices, this fire is stationed to the east of the sabhya fire, in a hut called &#x2018;āvasatha.&#x2019; The hearth is triangular in shape, each side being 25 aṅgulis (aṅguli = finger&#x2019;s breadth).</p>
			<p>Some authorities of Vedic sacrifices held its establishment compulsory and others as optional. For establishing it, the original fire had to be brought from the gārhapatya.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;three states of consciousness&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Works of Vedānta based primarily on the teachings of the Upaniṣads, recognize three &#x2018;avasthās&#x2019; or states of consciousness with which we are all familiar: jāgrat (waking state), svapna (dream state) and suṣupti (deep-sleep state). In the jāgrad avasthā both the sense-organs and the mind are active. In the svapna-avasthā it is only the mind, impelled by the latent impression of the waking experience, and, sometimes, by the latent impressions of past lives, that is active. In the suṣupti-avasthā, even the mind is at rest.</p>
			<p>In all these three states there is always a &#x2018;witness,&#x2019; called &#x2018;sākṣi-caitanya,&#x2019; who is ever present as an observer, who also experiences the effects of these states. He is the ātman or the Self.</p>
			<p>Since he is, apparently, the &#x2018;fourth&#x2019; (as opposed to the three states) he is called the &#x2018;turīya&#x2019; (= the fourth). However &#x2018;turīya&#x2019; is not considered as a state of consciousness but consciousness itself.</p>
			<p>An analysis of the three states of consciousness leading to the establishment of the ātman through reasoning, is called &#x2018;avasthā-traya-viveka&#x2019; or &#x2018;avasthā-traya-vivecana.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>This subject has been dealt with in detail in the <em>Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad</em> and the <em>Kārikās</em> of Gauḍapāda (A. D. 780).</p>

			<word>avatāra</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;one who has descended&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The concept of &#x2018;avatāra&#x2019; (incarnation of the Divine) is one of the fundamental tenets of Hinduism. The <em>locus classicus</em> of the theory of avatāra is in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (4.5-8).</p>
			<p>After creating this world, God sets it in motion and regulates it through the cosmic law known as ṛta, satya or dharma. When the cosmic law, the ṛta, is comprehended by the intellect, it becomes &#x2018;satya&#x2019; (truth). When life is regulated according to it, it becomes &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; (righteousness, right conduct).</p>
			<p>Since the human mind is a product of the three guṇas (sattva, rajas and tamas), it is subject to vicissitudes. In the beginning sattva will have the upper hand and people will naturally be inclined towards dharma. Hence life on earth moves smoothly in harmony and peace. Gradually, as rajas and tamas gain ascend-ance, people will incline towards evil; and this will upset the social equilibrium. Good people devoted to dharma will be neutralised and made ineffective whereas the evil ones addicted to adharma or unrighteousness will rule the roost. At such critical periods in human history God decides to &#x2018;come down&#x2019; (avatāra = coming down) in a human form (or even in a non-human form if that is necessary) and restore the spiritual and social equilibrium implied by the word &#x2018;dharma.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Though restoring dharma is the primary concern of an avatāra, eliminating or chastising the wicked, and, protecting the good—being a necessary and integral part of this process—are also undertaken by him.</p>
			<p>An avatāra is not just a jīva who has attained the state of liberation and is eager to help mankind. He represents the direct descent of God himself to the human level in order to help the human beings to ascend to the divine level, of which the liberated soul is a perfect example. A jīva is forced to take a body due to his past actions (prārabdha-karma) whereas the avatāra incarnates of his own free will for saving mankind. Consequently, he is always conscious of his mission and power. It is only he who can see both the Absolute (Brahman) and the manifested world simultaneously and can teach the world about the Absolute.</p>
			<p>Vedānta admits of God&#x2019;s manifestation as the world, his omniscience as also omnipotence and grace. Hence there is nothing unreasonable in the doctrine that he can also assume a special and unique form as avatāra, fully retaining consciousness of the divinity from his very birth.</p>
			<p>Another speciality of this doctrine is that God incarnates himself in response to the needs of the times wherever and whenever necessary. Hence there are no restrictions regarding either the number of incarnations or the place. The sole consideration is the decline of dharma and the rise of adharma in opposition to it, to such an extent that the social equi-librium is badly disturbed.</p>
			<p>The avatāra concept is probably suggested in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself (3.53.8; 6.47.18) where Indra is said to be endowed with the mysterious power of assuming any form at will. Some of the avatāras mentioned in the lists of the &#x2018;Daśāvatāras&#x2019; (ten incarnations) are met with in the earlier Vedic literature. The <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> mentions the story of Matsya (fish incarnation) as also of the Kūrma (tortoise incarnation) and of the Varāha (boar incarnation) (<em>vide</em> 1.8.1.1-6; 7.5.1.5; 14.1.2.11). The Vāmanāvatāra (dwarf incarnation) of Viṣṇu taking the three steps is also clearly mentioned in the same scriptures (1.2.5.1).</p>
			<p>Coming to the age of the epics and the purāṇas we find a tendency towards limiting the avatāras to ten (hence the name &#x2018;Daśāvatāras&#x2019; or ten incarnations) the last one (Kalki) being yet to come. The Daśāvatāras are: Matsya (the fish), Kūrma (the tortoise), Varāha (the boar), Narasiṁha (the man-lion), Vāmana (the dwarf), Paraśurāma (Rāma with the battle-axe), Rāma (the son of Daśaratha), Kṛṣṇa (the son of Vasudeva), Buddha (Gautama Buddha) and Kalki. However, there is no unanimity or uniformity in the various lists given by these works. Around the tenth century A. D., Buddha seems to have gained a place in the lists as the ninth incarnation. In the earlier lists as also the later ones, Buddha has been replaced by Balarāma (Rāma of strength, elder brother of Kṛṣṇa). Some lists include both Balarāma and Buddha but omit Kṛṣṇa, the <em>raison d&#x2019;etre</em> being that all the ten are the avatāras of Kṛṣṇa who is the Lord Viṣṇu Himself.</p>
			<p>Sometimes we come across many more avatāras than the traditional ten. For instance, the <em>Bhāgavata</em> gives three lists of 22 names (1.3.6-22), 23 names (2.7.1 ff.) and 16 names (11.4.3 ff.) and also declares that the avatāras are innumerable (1.3.26).</p>
			<p>Occasionally the avatāras are classified into three types: pūrṇāvatāra, aṁśāvatāra and āveśāvatāra. Pūrṇāva-tāras are those in which the manifestation of the Divine is full and complete (pūrṇa = full) as in Rāma and Kṛṣṇa. Aṁśāva-tāras are partial manifestations (aṁśa = part) of the Divine as in great sages like Vyāsa. Āveśāvatāras are those in which there is a temporary entry of the Divine (āveśa = entry) as in the case of Nṛsiṁha manifesting through Padmapāda (a disciple of Śaṅkara) who was a votary of that deity.</p>

			<p>Married Hindu ladies cherish death before that of their husbands. Such ladies are called &#x2018;avidhavās&#x2019; or &#x2018;non-widows.&#x2019; The śrāddha or obsequial rite for such women is performed on the ninth day during the dark half of the month Bhādrapada (corresponding roughly to September) by their sons or younger male relatives. One of the specialities of this rite is that not only a brāhmaṇa but also married ladies whose husbands are alive, are invited, fed and given presents. The rite generally ceases to be performed when their husbands die.</p>

		<description>
			<p>How Brahman, &#x2018;the One without a second,&#x2019; the only Reality, appears as this phenomenal universe, is a question that has baffled the Indian philosophers who have accepted the final authority of the śruti or the Vedas, for ages. Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) posits avidyā, ajñāna or māyā as the factor responsible for this. (See <ref>AJÑĀNA</ref> for details.) Later Advaitins have tried to present māyā as the cause and avidyā or ajñāna as its effect. The latter words have been variously rendered as &#x2018;nescience,&#x2019; &#x2018;ignorance,&#x2019; &#x2018;non-knowledge&#x2019; or even &#x2018;anti-knowledge.&#x2019; In the final analysis it defies all definition.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;avidyā&#x2019; has been used by Patañjali (200 B. C.) in his <em>Yogasūtras</em> (2.3-5). He considers it as one of the five &#x2018;kleśas&#x2019; or afflictions, but as the ground for the origin of the others. He defines it as that which makes us feel that the transient is eternal, the impure is pure, misery is happiness and the non-self is the Self. It can be eliminated only by &#x2018;viveka-khyāti&#x2019; the knowledge that we as the Self (which is pure consciousness) are entirely separate and different from prakṛti or insentient nature.</p>

			<p>Among the post-Śaṅkara schools of Vedānta, the Śuddhādvaita (also known as &#x2018;Puṣṭimārga&#x2019;) of Vallabha (A. D. 1473-1531) is an important one. This school based equally on the authority of the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> and the <em>Bhāgavata</em> as also on the Vedas and the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, posits Brahman as personal. He creates this world in &#x2018;līlā&#x2019; or sport out of himself. But though this world is a &#x2018;pariṇāma&#x2019; or a transformation of his, he continues to remain &#x2018;avikṛta&#x2019; or unchanged, since the entire process is only a līlā. This doctrine is therefore called &#x2018;avikṛta-pariṇāma-vāda.&#x2019;</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Patañjali (200 B. C.) the great teacher of yoga, lists nine serious obstacles to the attainment of yoga (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 1.30) of which &#x2018;avirati&#x2019; or absence of the spirit of renunciation is one. Yoga is &#x2018;citta-vṛtti-nirodha&#x2019; or suppressing the modifications of the mind. These modifications continue to rise as long as their causes like kāma or desire for the pleasures of the senses exist. Kāma has to be controlled by &#x2018;virati&#x2019; or dispassion or an intense spirit of renunciation. If this virati is absent, then, that state is called &#x2018;avirati&#x2019; which is a serious obstacle to yoga.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hinduism considers the ties of marriage to be sacred and inviolable. A married Hindu woman shudders at the least prospect of separation from her husband. &#x2018;Aviyoga-vrata&#x2019; (also called &#x2018;Aviyoga-tṛtīyā&#x2019;) is a religious vow specially prescribed for a married woman and is supposed to bring about non-separation from her husband. It begins on the 3rd day of the bright half of Mārgaśira (November-December) and continues for one year. The women who undertake this vrata start it on this day by partaking rice boiled in milk and sugar. They worship Gaurī (Pārvatī) and Śambhu (Śiva) in images made of rice flour, under different names (in each of the twelve months) with different flowers.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Tamil is one of the oldest languages of the world with a rich ancient literature. Avvaiyār (also spelt as &#x2018;Auvaiyār&#x2019;) is one outstanding poetess of the ancient period who is almost as well-known as the other, the most well-known of all, Tiruvaḷḷuvar.</p>
			<p>Not much is known about her. According to popular stories she was one of the seven children of Ādi, a lowcaste woman, and Bhagavān, a brāhmaṇa.</p>
			<p>Scholars who have studied the poems attributed to Avvaiyār have come to the conclusion that there were two or perhaps more poetesses of the same name living in different periods of history. The first belonged to the Saṅgam period (2nd cent. A.D.). King Ādiyamān had given her a high and honoured place. About 59 poems of this period are available now. Apart from literary grace, these poems stress that it is the character of the people that makes a country great.</p>
			<p>The second Avvaiyār, a contemporary of the Śaiva saint Sundaramūrti, might have lived in the last part of the 8th cent. A. D. The third was a contemporary of the famous Kamban (12th cent. A. D.).</p>
			<p>Poems of these Avvaiyārs extol the greatness of the householder&#x2019;s life, of agri-culture, and of acquiring knowledge. For a human being, that māna or honour is the most important acquisition, is also stressed.</p>
			<p>Ethical works attributed to Avvaiyār, apart from the songs, are: <em>Mūdurai, Atticcūḍi, Nalvaḷi</em> and <em>Kosaraivendan</em>.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Sāṅkhya system, one of the six systems of Indian philosophy, posits two fundamental principles of creation: prakṛti (also called &#x2018;pradhāna&#x2019;) and puruṣa. Prakṛti is the primeval insentient material cause; and puruṣas, of infinite number, are the conscious entities or souls. The whole world is a creation that comes out of the association of the puruṣas with the various evolutes of prakṛti.</p>
			<p>Prakṛti, which consists of the three guṇas—sattva, rajas and tamas—is in a state of perfect internal balance and equilibrium. This is its natural state before evolution into the world. Hence it is also called &#x2018;avyakta&#x2019; or the unmanifest.</p>
			<p>In Vedānta, the term is sometimes used to indicate Brahman, the Absolute.</p>

			<word>Avyakta Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a minor upaniṣad belonging to the<em>Sāmaveda</em>. It is in prose and is spread over seven sections. It deals with the &#x2018;Avyakta&#x2019; (the unmanifest) and the evolution of the manifested world from it.</p>
			<p>Before creation, It alone existed, the light Divine, beyond all names, forms and qualities. It split itself into two, one being green and the other red in colour. The latter assumed a male form and the former the female form called &#x2018;māyā.&#x2019; By the union of these two was produced the golden egg from which emerged Parameṣṭhi or Prajāpati. When he was pondering as to who he was and what was his duty, he heard the divine voice of an invisible being. It told him that he had come out of the Avyakta and that he had to create the vyakta (the manifest, the world). For this he had to live a life of brahmacarya for a thousand years. At the end of this period of austere living, parama-vidyā or the highest knowledge was revealed to him in the form of ṛks in the anuṣṭubh metre. He sang these for a thousand years. Then he saw the Lord in the form of Nṛsiṁha (Man-lion). He praised him through appropriate phrases. Being pleased with this, Lord Nṛsiṁha commanded him to create the world and taught him a special meditation. By meditating that he was offering himself into the Lord as the fire, he obtained all the knowledge and all the powers needed for creation. Then, with the help of these ṛks, he created the three worlds, the gods including Indra, the eleven Rudras, the eleven Ādityas including Viṣṇu, the eight Vasus, day and night, the four Vedas, the various metres, the four varṇas and all the beings of the world. The Upaniṣad ends with a phalaśruti or laudatory statements regarding the fruits one obtains if he knows this vidyā or knowledge revealed here.</p>

			<p>The images of Sūrya, the Sun-god, have a waist band called abhyaṅga or avyaṅga. According to the <em>Bhaviṣya-purāṇa</em>, during each of the six ṛtus or seasons, there came to Sūrya one representative from among the following by rotation: ṛṣis, devatās, nāgas, gandharvas, apsaras, yakṣas and rākṣasas. In one of those turns Vāsuki, the nāga, presented Sūrya with a cord called &#x2018;avyaṅga&#x2019; produced from his body.</p>
			<p>This cord was composed of gold and was half red and half white. Iconographical representations of Sūrya are invariably shown with the avyaṅga. The followers of the Sūrya cult wear a similar cord round their waists.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the group of six [formulae] starting with Āya&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p><em>Mānasāra</em>, the most authoritative text dealing with Hindu architecture, iconography as also town-planning, gives us a set of six formulae known as the &#x2018;Āyādi-ṣaḍvarga.&#x2019; While dealing with the length,</p>
			 <ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>breadth</li>
				<li>and circumference or height or thickness</li>
				<li>of any structure, the book gives several alternatives, the right dimension being chosen by the appli-cation of these six formulae. These are āya, vyaya, ṛkṣa yoni, vāra, tithi and aṁśa.</li>
			 </ul>
			<p>These names represent well-known groups of objects that always follow a certain serial order. For instance, vāra represents the group of seven days of the week. Ṛkṣa represents the group of twenty-seven nakṣatras (star-groups).</p>
			<p>Each one of these formulae has already been determined by the text itself. The suitability of a dimension is checked by the remainder left after the application of the concerned formulae. For example, if the height of a proposed new building is to be determined from among the several alternatives suggested by the work, the vāra formula ($\frac{C x 9}{7}$) is applied, C standing for the height.</p>
			<p>If the remainder is 4, it indicates the fourth day (Wednesday) of the week, considered to be auspicious. Then the measurement chosen is right.</p>

			<p>Kauṭilya (300 B. C.) the well-known author of <em>Arthaśāstra</em>, classifies the sources or items of revenue for the State as two: āyaśarīra (body of income) and āyamukha (sources of income). The āyaśarīra which refers to the centres of collection comprises durga (fortified cities), rāṣṭra (rural areas), khani (mines), setu (irrigation works,) vana (forests), vraja (herds) and vāripatha (river-borne trade routes). The subdivisions of āyamukha are: bhāga (royal share), vyāji (compensation), parigha (gate duty) klṛpta (fixed tax), rūpika (premia on coins) and atyaya (money-fine).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Though the word literally means &#x2018;course&#x2019; or &#x2018;path,&#x2019; it is generally used to indicate the course of the sun to the north or the south of the equator. The northward course is called &#x2018;Uttarāyaṇa&#x2019; whereas the southward course is named as &#x2018;Dakṣi-ṇāyana.&#x2019; The former is the period of mid-winter to mid-summer and the latter, that of mid-summer to mid-winter. According to the <em>Sūryasiddhānta</em> (14.5.9), a well-known authoritative work of astronomy, the period of six months from the sun&#x2019;s entrance (called &#x2018;saṅkrānti&#x2019;) into Capricorn (Makararāśi) is called &#x2018;Uttarāyaṇa.&#x2019; Similarly, the period of six months from the sun&#x2019;s entrance into Cancer (Karkāṭaka-rāśi) is called &#x2018;Dakṣiṇāyana.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Hindu religious traditions have always considered death during Utta-rāyaṇa as propitious. The <em>Mahābhārata</em> says that the venerable Bhīṣma waited till Uttarāyaṇa to give up the body.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;ayana&#x2019; is also used to indicate the precession of the equinoxes. According to the later astronomers like Āryabhaṭṭa II (A. D. 1028) the equinoctial point oscillates about a mean point. The amplitude of precessional oscillation is 27 degrees and the period of one complete oscillation is 7200 years. The rate of precession is uniform and is 54 seconds per year. A sidereal year that disregards this precession is called &#x2018;nirayana&#x2019; and, the tropical year that takes it into account is called &#x2018;sāyana.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The total precession of the equinoxes since zero-precession year is called &#x2018;ayanāṁśa.&#x2019; The ayanāṁśa at present is calculated to be 22 degrees. During the next 350 years it will gradually increase up to 27 degrees. It will then start decreasing to zero over the next 1800 years.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Ayodhyā is the first of the seven holy cities of ancient India considered to be capable of giving mukti or liberation. It is also famous because of its association with Rāma, the son of Daśaratha, considered to be an incarnation of God.</p>
			<p>Manu, the first traditional king of India, is said to have founded the city of Ayodhyā as his capital. It was 12 yojanās long and 3 yojanās broad. (1 yojanā = 15 kilometres.) The galaxy of great rulers who ruled from here includes Ikṣvāku, Māndhātā, Hariścandra, Bhagīratha, Dilīpa and Raghu. The great ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha and his family were the hereditary priests of the royal families of Ayodhyā.</p>
			<p>King Vikramāditya of Vikram Śaka fame is said to have raised a temple at the birth-place of Rāma and also rebuilt the city.</p>
			<p>The city of Sāketas, well-known during the time of Buddha, has been identified with Ayodhyā.</p>
			<p>Both Fa-Hien (A. D. 400) and Hiuen Tsang (A. D. 596)—the famous Chinese travellers—visited Ayodhyā and have left interesting accounts of the same. During their visits they found it to be a flourishing city with several Buddhist monasteries.</p>
			<p>Ayodhyā has been considered as a sacred place by the Jains also. Several Tīrthaṅkaras had lived here.</p>
			<p>The modern town of Ayodhyā, on the bank of the river Sarayū (also called Ghogrā), is about 130 kms. from Lucknow and 190 kms. from Vārāṇasī. It is in the Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh. Apart from the spot said to be the birth-place of Rāma, the other places of interest for the tourists and the pilgrims are: Lakṣman Ghāṭ, Svarga Dvār, Hanumān Garhī, Kanak Bhavan and Tulasī Cowrā.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;that by which one fights&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>An āyudha is a weapon or an imple-ment by which one fights. Several weapons have been known to have existed in ancient India. They are generally classified into three groups:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>praharaṇa (those by which one strikes the enemy, like a khaḍga or sword);</li>
				<li>pāṇimukta (those that are discharged or thrown from the hand, like a cakra or discus);</li>
				<li>yantramukta (those released from a mechanical contrivance, like a śara or arrow).</li>
			 </ol>
			<p>The images of gods and goddesses invariably carry āyudhas to signify their role in their fight against the forces of evil and sin. Hindu mythological lore is full of legends of the fights of the deities against the demons. The liberal provision of arms to the iconographical representations of the various deities is often to provide scope for carrying the various weapons, implements and emblems.</p>
			<p>Certain weapons are invariably associated with certain deities like the cakra (discus) with Viṣṇu, triśūla (trident) with Śiva, dhanuṣ (bow) with Rāma, śūla (spear) with Durgā and so on. Consequently, these help us in identifying the particular deity represented by these icons.</p>
			<p>Very often, these āyudhas are represented with a human form, with the parti-cular weapon shown either in the background behind the head or over the head or in its hands. Such forms are called &#x2018;āyudha-puruṣas&#x2019; or personified weapons. The sex of this deity is dependent on the gender of the Sanskrit word for that weapon. For instance, gadā (mace) is a female deity whereas cakra (discus) is a eunuch. Śūla (spear), aṅkuśa (goad) and vajra (thunderbolt) are male deities. These deities are generally shown with one face and two hands, held in an attitude of adoration. They wear karaṇḍa-mukuṭa (bowl-shaped crown).</p>

			<word>Āyurveda</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;Science of life&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Vedic Āryans believed in a vigorous life, a life of health, strength and vitality. They paid as much attention to the culture of the body and the arts of war as to the science of the mind and the spirit. This gradually resulted in the &#x2018;Āyurveda&#x2019; or the &#x2018;science of life,&#x2019; the elements of which have been found even in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. However it is in the <em>Atharvaveda</em> that a more detailed—and to some extent, systematic—treatment of the subject, is found.</p>
			<p>Though the word &#x2018;Āyurveda&#x2019; appears to limit its scope to purely physical health alone, it is not so. Its approach to the science of health is holistic and includes not only the physical but also the mental and spiritual aspects of health in the context of man&#x2019;s interaction with his environment. While doing so, it deals with several subjects which may be categorized briefly as follows: philosophical speculations about matter and life as also general ethics; biological theories which include embryology and genetics; physiology and pathology; food, nutrition and diet, general rules of health and longevity, diagnosis and treatment of diseases; poisons and their antidotes.</p>
			<p>As in the case of other ancient Hindu sciences, the origins of Āyurveda also are buried in the bosom of hoary myth and tradition. Starting with Bramhā the Creator himself, this science was handed down first to the Aśvins, the twin deities and then to Indra. Then it is said to have branched off into two streams, of medicine and surgery. Bharadvāja, Ātreya Punarvasu and the six disciples of the latter like Agniveśa and Kṣīrapāṇi established the science of medicine whereas Suśruta established the science of surgery. Modern scholars are inclined to believe that Dhanvantari and Divodāsa (the king of Kāśi), the other two well-known names, actually represent the same person Bharadvāja; and that Ātreya and Suśruta are identical. They also hold that Caraka and Suśruta are the historical personages who organized the two bodies of know-ledge, medicine and surgery. They probably lived in the pre-Christian era and the redaction of their texts were done in the early part of post-Christian era.</p>
			<p>Classical texts of the Āyurveda, especially those of Caraka and Suśruta, contain certain metaphysical speculations about matter and life. They generally follow the Sāṅkhya-Vedānta view of cosmo-gony and the allied Vaiśeṣika view of inherent nature of substances. All material substances are evolved from the interaction of prakṛti (the dynamic principle comprising the three guṇas, sattva, rajas and tamas) and puruṣa (the static and conscious principle). The material bodies of human beings are composed of kalā (protective layer), dhātu (component matter), mala (eliminations), three doṣas (humours), agni (digestive fire) and kriyā (movement or activity). These components, as also the pañca-mahā-bhūtas (five gross elements) impart their specific nature and properties to the individual in proportion to their presence.</p>
			<p>Most of the standard texts of the Āyurveda deal with the subject under eight topical headings—hence the appellation &#x2018;Aṣṭāṅga&#x2019;—as follows:</p>
			<p>Kāyacikitsā (therapeutics), Śalya-tantra (major surgery), Śālākya-tantra (minor-surgery including the E.N.T.), Bhūtavidyā (psychiatry), Kaumāra-bhṛtya-tantra (paediatrics), Agada-tantra (toxico-logy), Rasāyanatantra (geriatrics) and Vājīkaraṇatantra (virilification).</p>
			<p>Kāyacikitsā relates to the treatment of diseases affecting the whole body. The diseases are said to be the result of the imbalance of the three doṣas or humours. An excess of vāta or wind can lead to nearly 80 diseases. The treatment of such diseases involves the liberal use of medicated oils. A surfeit of pitta or bile can cause as many as 40 diseases affecting blood or eyes or skin. The treatment is generally centred round purgatory pro-cesses and medicines. A profusion of śleṣma (phlegm) can produce 20 kinds of illnesses affecting the throat, the digestive and the excretory organs. Administration of certain astringent substances to make the patient vomit is an important course of treatment adopted in curing this defect.</p>
			<p>Śalya-tantra deals with the methods of removal of arrows (śalya=arrow) and other foreign bodies, obstetrics and treatment of injuries and diseases requiring major surgery. The <em>Suśruta Saṁhitā</em> which is a great classic in surgery, gives an amazing amount of information regarding the use of about 100 surgical instruments, alkalis, bandages, pre-operative preparations and post-operative care including nursing. Plastic surgery too was known to the surgeons.</p>
			<p>Śālākya-tantra is concerned with the treatment of the diseases of the body above the clavicle (E.N.T.) using thin bars, small sticks and probes as instruments.</p>
			<p>Bhūtavidyā treats of mental derangements and disturbances believed to have been caused by malevolent spirits. Apart from prayers and exorcism, administration of certain drugs is also mentioned. Mention is also made of Pañcakarmas or five purificatory processes which will help relieve the mental illnesses. Analysis of dreams of the patients in order to find out the root causes has also been attempted.</p>
			<p>Kaumārabhṛtya-tantra deals specially with obstetrics, female diseases connected with child-birth and the diseases of children, many of which were considered to have been caused by demons. Attention has been paid to the bringing up of children from the standpoint of health.</p>
			<p>Agada-tantra discusses the methods of diagnosis and treatment of the bites of poisonous snakes, scorpions or insects and of other poison cases. A very large number of poisons have been mentioned with appropriate remedies including mantras that eliminate or destroy the poisons.</p>
			<p>Rasāyana-tantra deals with the methods of preservation and increase of vigour, restoration of youth, improvement of memory and prevention of diseases. The medicines are prepared out of mercury and precious stones apart from certain other materials.</p>
			<p>Vājīkaraṇa-tantra concerns the means of increasing virile powers as also prevention and cure of venereal diseases. The standard works generally extol brahmacarya (continence) as the best means.</p>
			<p>The techniques of diagnosis of diseases had been fairly well-developed. Apart from his own observations and inferences, the physician also depended upon the instructions of the wise. Other factors which helped in the diagnostic process were: the normal constitution of the patient, time and season of the first appearance of the disease, things giving comfort or relief to the patient, things that cause aggravation of the disease, nature of digestion and appetite, the way the organs of evacuation are functioning, and, whether the disease is in an advanced stage or not.</p>
			<p>During the medieval period, &#x2018;nāḍī-vijñāna&#x2019; (the science of pulse) came to be a major means of diagnosing the condition of the three doṣas.</p>
			<p>Treatment of diseases, according to the Āyurveda, depends upon four factors: physician, patient, medicines and attendant nurse. Factors governing the treatment are puruṣa (patient), vyādhi (dis-ease), oṣadhi (medicine), kriyā (processes) and kāla (seasonal and climatic factors). Āhāra (diet) and ācāra (right conduct and medical regimen) were also considered important. Saṁśamana (sedation) and saṁśodhana (purgatory processes) were often resorted to.</p>
			<p>Texts of Āyurveda lay down a strict code of conduct for the physician. He should treat the patients to the best of his ability since they trust him for their lives. He should refuse to treat morally depraved persons who are a scourge to the society. He should also refuse to take up terminal cases where he is sure that death is imminent. Nor should he undertake the responsibility of patients suffering from incurable diseases. Once he accepts a patient, he should provide him with proper medical and nursing facilities. He should never attend to a woman patient in the absence of her husband or guardian. All professional information should be kept strictly confidential. He must have compassion on his patients, look upon them as his own children; but, adopt a philosophical outlook in respect of cases proving fatal.</p>
			<p>Āyurvedic theories and practices were also applied to animal and plant life. There are voluminous medical treatises on plant life (Vṛksāyurveda), bovine species (Gavāyurveda), horses (Aśvāyurveda) and elephants (Hastyāyurveda).</p>
			<p>A new type of Āyurvedic treatment, &#x2018;rasacikitsā,&#x2019; which incorporated iatro-chemistry or metallic compounds came into vogue around A.D. 1300. Opium and certain other foreign drugs as also mineral acids and tinctures were incorporated into Āyurvedic pharmacology in about A. D. 1500.</p>
			<p>There is evidence to believe that Āyurveda had influenced the medical works of Greece. Translations of several well-known Āyurvedic texts into Arabic prove the spread of the science in the Arab countries. Evidence is also not wanting to prove its dispersal in Central and South East Asian countries.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophy recognizes two kinds of relations: saṁyoga or conjunction and samavāya or inherence. Conjunction is a temporary phenomenon which will come into existence when two things—like two balls moving from opposite directions—meet. Since it comes into existence (siddha) when the two are united (yuta), it is called &#x2018;yutasiddha.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>However, in the case of samavāya, as distinct from saṁyoga, the relationship is permanent since one inheres in the other. For instance, the whole inheres in the parts (as cloth in its threads), a quality or an action inheres in a substance (as redness in the rose, motion in the moving ball) or the universal inheres in the individuals (as manhood in men). Here, the two (e.g., cloth and threads or redness and rose) are related <em>without</em> conjunction. This relation exists (siddha) eventhough there is no conjunction (ayuta) between the entities. Hence it is called &#x2018;ayuta-siddha.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Samavāya is a relationship of the &#x2018;ayutasiddha&#x2019; type.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Being a patronymic name it represents anyone who is a descendant of the sage Babhru. The sage Girija of the <em>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</em> and the sage Śaṅkha of <em>Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa</em> were Bābhravyas.</p>
			<p>The sage Gālava, mentioned in the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, was also a Bābhravya. He was a great yogi and had organized the science of euphony of the Vedas (called Śikṣā).</p>
			<p>The <em>Skāndapurāṇa</em> mentions a Bābhravya. Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava hero, during his pilgrimage, met Bābhravya and heard from him about the greatness of the sage Nārada.</p>
			<p>One Bābhravya is said to have produced a condensed version of Kāma-śāstra (the Science of Erotics), originally written by Śvetaketu.</p>

			<p>When Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava hero, was on a tour, as penance, he went to the kingdom of Citravāhana, ruling at Maṇalūr. The king offered his daughter Citrāṅgadā in marriage to him. Babhru-vāhana was the son born to them. He grew up into a great warrior worthy of his father.</p>
			<p>After the Kurukṣetra war, when Yudhiṣṭhira decided to perform the Aśva-medha sacrifice, Arjuna escorted the sacri-ficial horse through various kingdoms. The horse was caught by Babhruvāhana; and in the ensuing fight Arjuna was killed by him, but was revived by Ulūpī, another wife of Arjuna, by placing the Sañjīvaka-maṇi, a precious stone capable of reviving dead persons, on his chest.</p>
			<p>Babhruvāhana attended the Aśva-medha sacrifice at Hastināpura.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Nestling at the foot of steep hills, this small town is situated in the Bijapur district of Karnataka State. Known as Vātāpi in the ancient days, it was the capital of the Cālukyan empire during the period A.D. 550-753. It contains several temples of the structural as well as the rock-cut varieties. Near the fort there are temples dedicated to Hanumān and Śiva. On the southern hill, situated on its western side, there are four cave-temples (three Hindu and one Jain). They resemble the ones at Ellora. The pillared halls in them show a high standard of workmanship and are uniformly of the same appearance. The pillars are mostly square in section though a few of the inner colonnade in Cave no.3 are multifaceted.</p>
			<p>In the first cave are seen images of Śiva with 18 arms, Gaṇeśa, Viṣṇu, Lakṣmī as also Śiva-Pārvatī. The back wall contains panel-figures of Mahiṣāsuramardinī (Durgā), Gaṇeśa and Skanda. The second cave contains images of Vāmana, Varāha, Nārāyaṇa on Garuḍa and Nārāyaṇa on the serpent Śeṣa. The third cave has images and figures of Ardhanārīśvara, Pārvatī, Narasiṁha and Varāha. The fourth cave contains the images of the Jain Tīrthaṅkaras.</p>
			<p>Among the structural temples, the Mālegitti Śivālaya built on a hill over-looking the town of Bādāmi needs special mention. It is a massive solid structure, though not very large. It consists of a cella, an assembly hall and a porch.</p>
			<p>There are fine frescos, very much like those of Ajanta, in Cave no. 3. The most important and well-preserved of these is that of the betrothal of Pārvatī to Śiva. These paintings belong to the 6th century A. D.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Vedānta is the last of the six systems of Indian philosophy. Bādarāyaṇa is stated to be its author. Hindu tradition identifies him with Veda-Vyāsa (also known as Kṛṣna Dvaipāyana), the celebrated author of the <em>Mahābhārata.</em> Lexicographers like Hemacandra (A. D. 1088-1173) (<em>vide</em> his <em>Abhidhānacintāmaṇi—Martyakāṇḍa,</em> 512) support this view. Since he lived along with his disciples and son Śuka, at the Badarī in the Himālayas, he might have used this name in his composition, the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>.</p>
			<p>Bādarāyaṇa appears in the <em>Sāma-vidhāna Brāhmaṇa</em> of the <em>Sāmaveda</em>. Varāhamihira (A. D. 505-587) and Bhaṭṭotpala (10th cent. A. D.) well-known astronomers, have mentioned another Bādarāyaṇa in their works. But, they are different from Bādarāyaṇa-Vyāsa.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Tīrthayātrā or pilgrimage to holy places has been an age-old exercise under-taken by the pious Hindus. The Himālayas and the river Gaṅgā have so captivated the Hindu mind for generations that a majority of these places of pilgrimage is associated with them. Badarīnātha, also spelt as Badrināth, situated in the Chamoli district of Uttaranchal, is one of the most important of these and has been classed among the &#x2018;Caturdhāmas&#x2019; (the four Holy Places), the other three being Dvārakā in Western India, Purī in Eastern India and Rāmeśvaram in South India. A visit to these four places has been a life-time&#x2019;s ambition of many a devout Hindu since it is as good as covering all important places of pilgrimage in the country.</p>
			<p>The place itself might have derived its name from the existence of Badarī or the jujube tree in plenty in that area.</p>
			<p>Even from the most ancient days, Badarīnātha has been considered as very sacred. It was known as Badarikāśrama. It was here that the twin sages, Nara-Nārāyaṇa, had built their hermitage and performed severe austerities. The sage Parāśara and Vyāsa, the celebrated author of the Mahābhārata, lived here with their disciples. Consequently Vyāsa got the by-name Bādarāyaṇa.</p>
			<p>The town is situated at a height of about 7000 metres (23,300 ft.), in a valley nearly 6 kms. long and 2 kms. wide (4 miles by 1.3 miles). The temple is on the right bank of the river Alakanandā.</p>
			<p>The original temple is said to have been built by Śaṅkarācārya in the 8th century A.D., after recovering the old image from the Nārada Kuṇḍa (pond). Over the centuries, avalanches washed out many a temple and the present one is comparatively a modern structure.</p>
			<p>Near the temple is a hot-water pond called &#x2018;Taptakuṇḍa&#x2019;, with a thermal spring of sulphurous waters. A bath here is a must, before the visit to the temple.</p>
			<p>The temple of Lord Nārāyaṇa is about 13.5 metres (45 ft.) in height and faces east. There is a golden kalaśa or pinnacle on the top. The image inside the temple is made of &#x2018;śālagrāmaśilā&#x2019; or black stone. It is in the padmāsana or seated posture, with four arms, carrying the well-known symbols śaṅkha (conch), cakra (discus), gadā (mace) and padma (lotus). Other images found in the temple are those of Nara and Nārāyaṇa, Uddhava, Nārada, Garuḍa and Kubera.</p>
			<p>The chief priest called &#x2018;Rāval&#x2019; is a Nambūdiri brāhmaṇa from Kerala, as per the traditions established by Śaṅkarācārya.</p>
			<p>The temple, being situated among the mountains of the Himālayan snow range, is open to the devotees only for about six months (April-May to November). The utsavamūrti (image used in temple processions) is shifted to the temple of Narasiṁha at Joshimath, a place situated at a distance of 48 kms (31 miles) from Badarinath and worshipped there during the winter months. The chief priest and his entourage also shift to this place for this purpose. The &#x2018;Jyotirmaṭha,&#x2019; one of the four principal monasteries established by Śaṅkarācārya is also situated here.</p>
			<p>Lord Badarīnātha is worshipped in five different places. Hence they are collectively called &#x2018;Pañcabadarīs.&#x2019; They are: Viśāla Badarī (the main Badarīnath); Yogadhyāna Badarī (at Pāṇḍukeśvara, about 24 kms. [16 miles] away from Badarīnath); Bhaviṣya Badarī (near Tapovana, about 17 kms. [11 miles] away from the Joshimath); Vṛddha Badarī (at Animath, 17 kms. from Joshimath in the direction of Pipalkot) and Ādi Badarī (about 16 kms. [10 miles] from Karṇa-prayāg on the road to Rāṇikhet).</p>
			<p>It is believed that if śrāddha (obsequial ceremonies) is offered here at the place called &#x2018;Brahmakapāla&#x2019; on the bank of Alakanandā to the dead ancestors, they are liberated at once. Hence it is no more necessary to continue the annual śrāddhas.</p>

			<word>bādha</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;that which contradicts&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word has several meanings: abhāva or absence; pratibandha or obstacle; pīḍā or harassment. However, it is the Nyāya school (of Indian Philosophy) that uses it as a technical term of logic.</p>
			<p>In the sentence, <em>parvato vahnimān dhūmāt</em> (&#x2018;The hill is fiery, since there is smoke there&#x2019;), vahni or fire is called &#x2018;sādhya&#x2019; (the major term), parvata or hill is called &#x2018;pakṣa&#x2019; (the minor term) and dhūma or smoke as &#x2018;hetu&#x2019; or &#x2018;liṅga&#x2019; (the middle term).</p>
			<p>In a situation where the sādhya does not exist in the pakṣa, then the pakṣa is called bādha. For instance, in the sentence <em>hrado vahnimān dhūmāt</em> (&#x2018;The lake is fiery, since there is smoke there&#x2019;) the minor term hrada or lake, which is the pakṣa, is &#x2018;bādha&#x2019; since it is impossible for the fire, the sādhya, to exist in the lake. The lake obstructs or prevents (bādha = obstacle) fire from existing in it.</p>
			<p>Many more varieties of bādha are discussed in the works of Indian logic.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>In the Nyāya school of Indian philo-sophy, a material fallacy is technically called &#x2018;hetvābhāsa,&#x2019; which literally means that a hetu or reason which appears as, but really is not, a valid reason. Out of the five hetvābhāsas generally listed, &#x2018;bādhita&#x2019; is the last.</p>
			<p>Consider the sentence <em>agniranuṣṇaḥ dravyatvāt,</em> &#x2018;Fire is cold, since it is a substance&#x2019;. Here anuṣṇatva or coldness is the sādhya (major term) and dravya or substance is the hetu (middle term). The non-existence of coldness, nay more, the existence of hotness, is perceived in fire by our sense of touch. So, we have to reject hetu or the middle term, dravyatva (being a substance), as it is bādhita or contradicted by another means of knowledge (here, pratyakṣa or direct perception).</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Among the various types of Vedic sacrifices, the Somayāga is an important one. It derives its name from the fact that the juice of the soma creeper is used as oblation. This juice is pressed out of the creepers by stones or mortar and pestle, and is purified by being passed slowly through a strainer of sheep&#x2019;s wool. It is then transferred to jars and mixed with milk.</p>
			<p>There are three savanas or press-ings—morning, noon and evening, known respectively as prātas-savana, mādhyan-dina-savana and tṛtīya-savana.</p>
			<p>The Bahiṣpavamāna is the stotra or hymn that is chanted during the prātas-savana. Since it is outside (bahir = outside) the sadas or the assembly hall, it is called Bahiṣpavamāna.</p>
			<p>It consists of three tṛcas or triplets of Ṛgvedic mantras (9.11.1-3; 9.64.28-30; 9.66.10-12) making a total of nine verses. These verses are sung as Sāmans (Sāma-vedic chants) in a special style called &#x2018;trivṛt&#x2019; wherein the first verse of each triplet is chanted first followed by the second and the third. If the verses of each triplet are symbolically represented as a,b and c, the scheme of chanting will be thus: a1+a2+a3; b1+b2+b3+; c1+c2+c3.</p>
			<p>In sum, these verses welcome the deity presiding over the soma juice, beg him to protect the family and property of the sacrificer and describe the graceful flow of the juice through the strainer.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The country of Bāhlīka (also spelt as Bāhlika or Vāhlīka) has been mentioned in the epic <em>Mahābhārata</em> (<em>Bhīṣmaparva</em> 9). It has been identified with Bactria, north of Afghanistan and east of Iran. Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava hero, conquered this country during his victory marches before the Rājasūya sacrifice. The people of this country had come in for a lot of criticism due to their unethical ways of life (<em>Karṇaparva</em> 44). The <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> (<em>Ayodhyākāṇḍa</em> 68.18) alludes to a country called Bāhlīka, situated between Ayodhyā and Kekaya, which again extended between the rivers Śatadrū (Sutlej) and Vipāśā (Beas).</p>
			<p>The word Bāhlīka also refers to the king of that country who fought for Duryodhana against the Pāṇḍavas. There is also the mention of another Bāhlīka, younger brother of king Śantanu, the father of Bhīṣma.</p>

			<p>The ancient sages of India strove to maintain the highest standards of ethical purity in their personal life as well as social life. Śaṅkha and Likhita, the brothers whose <em>Smṛti</em> has earned a place for itself in the dharmaśāstra literature, were men of such sterling character. Once Likhita, the younger brother, went to the hermitage of Śaṅkha and ate some fruits from the garden without his prior permission. He realized the mistake which amounted to stealing and confessed the same to Śaṅkha. Śaṅkha sent him to the king Sudyumna. The king cut off his arms as a punishment. Likhita returned to Śaṅkha who approved of the punishment, but directed him to take a bath in the nearby river. When Likhita did so, he regained his arms. Since then, the river got the name &#x2018;Bāhudā,&#x2019; &#x2018;that which gave arms&#x2019;. It is identified with a river near Ayodhyā.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Bahulā (also known as Bahulā-caturthī) is one of the minor festivals observed in the northern parts of India on the fourth day of the dark fortnight (kṛṣṇa-caturthī) of the month of Bhādra (September). It is generally observed by women who have children. After the usual fasting and prayers as prescribed for such festivals, a cow with a calf is worshipped in the evening and also offered some sweets in an earthen pot. Fast can be broken only after that, with cooked barley. An observance of this festival with its vows is said to confer children and wealth on the votary.</p>
			<p>This festival is connected with two folk tales: A cow was caught by a hungry lion, begged the lion to allow it to feed its little calf at home and then return. The lion obliged and the cow returned, true to its promise. Moved by its devotion to truth, the lion let it go. It was on this day that the truthful cow was liberated by the lion.</p>
			<p>A lady, Vipulā by name, took the dead body of her young husband on a raft by a river called Bahulā, to the world of the serpent goddess Manasā and got him revived on this day. Hence, listening to this story on this day gives religious merit.</p>

			<p>In the beginning, the Devī or the Goddess alone existed. She created the Cosmic Egg. Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Rudra were born out of her; so also various other beings like the maruts (wind-gods), gandharvas (celestial minstrels), apsaras (nymphs) and beings of this earth.</p>
			<p>She is the Power Supreme. She is the various arts and sciences like the Śāmbhavī-vidyā (the science of Śambhu or God), the Kādi-vidyā, the Hādi-vidyā and the Sādi-vidyā (sciences related to the Divine Mother). She is Om and abides in the realm of words as their import. She is Mahātripurasundarī, pervading the three bodies—the gross, the subtle and the causal—as pure consciousness. She alone is the Ātman. Nothing exists apart from her. What is contemplated upon by the mahāvākyas (See <ref>MAHĀVĀKYAS</ref>.) is she herself. It is she that is called by various names such as: Bālā, Ambikā, Bagalā, Mātaṅgī, Bhuvaneśvarī, Cāmuṇḍā, Vārāhī, Aśvārūḍhā, Pratyaṅgirā, Dhūmāvatī, Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī and so on.

		<description>
			<p>Among the several schools of Śaivism, the Siddha school has a concept of mukti or liberation, peculiar to itself. Mukti is incomplete if it is confined only to the elimination of future births <em>after</em> death. It becomes complete only when death <em>here</em> is also transcended. A sādhaka or aspirant of the Siddha School, through appropriate exercise and spiritual practice, is able to transmute every cell in his body so that it is transformed from aśuddha-māyā (impure māya or nature)-state to śuddha-māyā (pure māyā or nature)-state. This transformed body which is incorruptible, is called &#x2018;praṇavatanu&#x2019; (body of praṇava or Om) or &#x2018;baindava-śarīra&#x2019; (body comprising the bindu or divine power—śakti). Then he becomes a &#x2018;jīvanmukta&#x2019; (one liberated even while living).</p>

			<p>Baka or Bakāsura was a rākṣasa (demon) who lived near the small town Ekacakranagara. Since he used to attack the town and eat up the human beings there, the residents of the town had made an agreement with him to supply food and one adult human being every day from among them, by turns. When the Pāṇḍavas were living there after being exiled, Bhīma (the second of the Pāṇḍava brothers) managed to kill him, thus ridding the town of a great menace (<em>vide</em> <em>Mahā-bhārata, Ādiparva-</em>163).</p>

			<p>The <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (1.2.13) mentions one Baka-dālbhya, as a sage who had realized the prāṇa (the chief vital air in the body and the deity presiding over it) through the singing of the udgītha (a part of the sāma hymn). He was the udgātṛ priest in the sacrifice performed by the Naimiśīyas and successfully got them what they wanted.</p>
			<p>The <em>Jaminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa</em> states (1.9.2) that Baka-dālbhya restrained Indra from harming the Ājakeśins (mem-bers of a particular family).</p>
			<p>The <em>Vāmanapurāṇa</em> (ch. 39) gives the story of a sage Baka-dālbhya who was about to destroy the kingdom of a ruler, Dhṛtarāṣṭra by name, through a sacrifice. The latter meanwhile realized his mistake—he had slighted the sage once—made amends for the same, pleased the sage and got back all that he had lost.</p>
			<p>It is rather difficult to say whether all these Baka-dālbhyas were one and the same. The possibility cannot be ruled out.</p>

			<p>Vratas or religious vows and observances are an integral part of Hinduism in practice. They are common even today. Among the several such vratas, &#x2018;Baka-pañcaka&#x2019; is one listed by religious digests. The five days from Kārttika śukla ekādaśi (eleventh day of the bright fortnight in the month of Kārttika, generally falling in November) to pūrṇimā (the full-moon day) are so called since it was believed that even a baka or a crane will not eat meat in these days. Hence, abstaining from eating meat during these five days is the main discipline expected of the votary.</p>

			<p>The literal meaning of the word &#x2018;bala&#x2019; is &#x2018;strength.&#x2019; However, the word is often used in a metaphorical sense, as for instance in statements like &#x2018;dhigbalaṁ kṣattriyabalaṁ brahmatejobalaṁ balam;&#x2019; (&#x2018;Fie be unto the power of the kṣattriya! The power of lustre of Brahman is verily the power!&#x2019;). There are other interesting statements such as: vāṇijya (trade) is the bala of a vaiśya; yuddha (war) is the bala of a kṣattriya; dhana (wealth) is the bala of a rich man; rodana (crying) is the bala of a child; anṛta (falsehood) is the bala of thieves; Paramātman (God) is the bala of devotees and so on.</p>
			<p>Works on Hindu political science like the <em>Arthaśāstra</em> of Kauṭilya (300 B.C.) declare that a rājya or state is constituted by seven elements like svāmin (ruler or sovereign), amātya (minister), janapada or rāṣṭra (the territory of the State and its people) and so on. Daṇḍa or bala (armed forces) is one of these seven constituents.</p>
			<p>Most of the ancient and early medieval works state that a big army should consist of four constituents; hence the name &#x2018;caturaṅga-bala,&#x2019; &#x2018;armed forces with four parts&#x2019;. They are hasti (elephants), aśva (horses), ratha (chariots) and padāti (foot-soldiers).</p>
			<p>The works also mention six kinds of troops: maula (hereditary troops), bhṛta or bhṛtaka (mercenary troops), śreṇi (guild troops), mitra (troops of an ally), amitra (troops that once belonged to an enemy) and aṭavī or āṭavika (wild tribes as troops). The earlier varieties of troops are superior to the later ones.</p>
			<p>The <em>Mahābhārata</em> declares that out of the several balas of a king like bāhubala (brute force), dhanabala (power of wealth), amātyabala (power due to the right type of ministers) and so on, prajñābala (power of wisdom) is the greatest (<em>Udyogaparva</em> 37.52-55).</p>
			<p>Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s elder brother is also known as Bala. (For details see <ref>BALARĀMA</ref>.)</p>

			<p>Worship of Śakti or the Mother Goddess is a very ancient practice in India. Of the several aspects of the Divine Mother Pārvatī, Lalitā or Lalitā-Tripurasundarī is very important and popular. Bālā (also called Bālā-Tripurasundarī) is an aspect of this Lalitā. Sometimes she is described as the daughter of Lalitā who helped her to destroy the army of the demon Bhaṇḍāsura.</p>
			<p>As her very name suggests, Bālā is pictured as an eternal girl of nine years. Iconographical works describe her as red in colour like hibiscus flower. She has four arms carrying akṣamālā (rosary), pāśa (noose), aṇkuśa (goad) and pustaka (book).</p>
			<p>Bālā is specially worshipped, by those desiring psychic powers.</p>

			<p>Among the luminaries of the Bhakti Movement that energized the Hindu masses during the middle ages, the greatest, perhaps, was Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya (A.D. 1485-1533), more commonly known as Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His teachings gradually got metamorphosed into a system of philosophy, now well-known as the <em>Acintyabhedābheda</em> school. Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa who lived in the early 18th century, is an important writer of this school. He was born in a village near Remuna in Orissa. He was a pupil of Vairāgi Pītāmbara Dāsa. Out of the 14 works attributed to him, the <em>Govinda-bhāṣya</em>, a commentary on the <em>Brahma-sūtras</em> is most well-known. It has a subcommentary called <em>Sūkṣma</em>, the author of which is unknown.</p>

			<p>There are several aspects of Gaṇapati, of which Bāla-Gaṇapati is one. He is represented iconographically as a boy, holding a mango, a plantain, a jack-fruit and a sugar-cane in his four hands. With his trunk he holds a wood-apple. His colour is that of the rising sun.</p>

			<p>The <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> (2.1) mentions one sage Bālāki (Son of the lady Balākā) who was Gārgya (a descendant of the sage Garga). He was nicknamed &#x2018;Dṛpta-Bālāki&#x2019; since he was a vain person (dṛpta = vain). He had mastered one aspect of the knowledge of Brahman. He went to the King Ajātaśatru of Kāśī and expressed his desire to teach him. The King, who was more learned, and could see through his vanity, proved his superi-ority. Then Bālāki became his disciple and learnt about the Brahman without attributes.</p>
			<p>Bālāki is also one of the names of the hundred sons of the king Dhṛtarāṣtṛa, the father of Duryodhana.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Pātaka (sin) and prāyaścitta (expi-ation of sin) are two of the widely discussed topics in the smṛtis and dharmaśāstras. Sins may be serious (mahāpātakas) or minor (upapātakas). The prāyaścittas prescribed for the mahāpātakas like killing a brāhmaṇa or incest, often end in the death of the sinner. But, those prescribed for the upapātakas like minor thefts or abandoning the Vedic fires, are tolerable and purify the sinners.</p>
			<p>Kṛcchra is a very general name given to most of these prāyaścittas. Bālakṛcchra—also called śiśukṛcchra or laghukṛcchra—is one variety prescribed for upapātakas in which the expiation is light and easy. If kṛcchras are usually spread over 12 days, bālakṛcchra is observed only for 4 days. It consists in eating once only in day time on the first day, once only in the night on the second day, eating food that comes unasked, that too only once, on the third day and, fasting on the fourth day. Other general rules as applicable to kṛcchras like bathing thrice daily, speaking the truth and so on, should also be followed.</p>

			<p>Smṛtis are secondary scriptures which expound dharma, in consonance with the Śruti or the Vedas. If the Śruti gives the general spiritual truths, the smṛtis give elaborate details pertaining to the code of conduct of an individual member of the society both at the personal and at the social level. One of the earliest smṛtis that ranks on almost equal terms with the <em>Manusmṛti</em>, is the <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti.</em> This work has two well-known commentaries: the <em>Mitākṣarā</em> of Vijñā-neśvara (12th cent. A.D.) and the <em>Bālakrīḍā</em> of Viśvarūpa (9th cent. A. D.).</p>
			<p>Being earlier than the <em>Mitākṣarā</em>, the <em>Bālakrīḍā</em> is a pioneering work. Its author, Viśvarūpa shows a good grasp of the Pūrvamīmāṁsā terms and logic, but seems to lean towards the advaita of Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) where philosophical ideas are concerned.</p>
			<p>Some scholars opine that Viśvarūpa and Sureśvara, a disciple of Śaṅkara, are identical, &#x2018;Viśvarūpa&#x2019; being his premonastic name.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the little temple&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hindu temples, with their images, are built with materials like stone, so that they can last long. Due to the ravages of time, weather, accidents or any other cause, when the temple structure or the image is damaged, needing repair or replacement, provision has been made in the āgamas for the necessary ritualistic processes to transfer the &#x2018;kalā&#x2019; or the power of the deity temporarily through a kalaśa (consecrated pitcher of water) to a new image and installed in a new temple provisionally built for the purpose. Once the renovation work is over, the &#x2018;kalā&#x2019; is transferred back to the old renovated temple and image.</p>
			<p>The temporary structure put up for this purpose to house the deity during the renovation work, so that the usual rituals can go on undisturbed, is technically called &#x2018;bālālaya&#x2019; or &#x2018;the little temple&#x2019;, since it is &#x2018;small&#x2019; compared to the original structure. It is generally built in the front of the old temple, but to its left side, and its door facing that of the old one. It should have both a garbhagṛha (<em>sanctum sanctorum</em>) and a maṇḍapa (hall) attached to it. The image may be made of either metal or wood. The entire process of consecration of the bālālaya is identical with that of any newly built temple. Once the old temple is renovated, the kalā is transferred back to the old image in the renovated shrine or to the new image installed there, if the old one had been damaged necessitating replacement. After this, the image of the bālālaya has to be burnt, if of wood, or melted, if of metal, and presented to the ācārya or preceptor. The old image of the original temple, if replaced, should be taken in a procession and immersed deeply in sea or river or lake.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Śakti or divine power of God is often pictured as a goddess, as the consort of the Deity. For instance, Pārvatī is the power of Śiva, personified as his consort. Out of the several such goddesses, all being the aspects of the supreme Śakti, Balapramathinī is a minor one. Since Sūrya or Sun is hot and enervating, this deity represents the Sun as a tattva or principle. She is pictured as white or reddish in complexion and has two hands carrying a kapāla (skull) and a pāśa (noose). She is the destroyer of all enemies and hence propitiated as such. Her consort is Ugra, a terrible aspect of Śiva.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Balarāma was the elder brother of Kṛṣṇa. He was conceived as the seventh son of Devakī by Vasudeva. But the foetus was drawn out of her by Yogamāyā (divine power) and placed in the womb of Rohiṇī, the elder wife of Vasudeva, living at Nandagokula. So he was born as the son of Rohiṇī. Since he was extraordinarily strong, he was called &#x2018;Balarāma&#x2019; (bala = strength). He had several other names like Saṅkarṣaṇa, Rauhiṇeya, Musalī, Halī, Nīlāmbara and so on. As per the paurāṇic lore, he was the incarnation of Ādiśeṣa (the serpent on which Viṣṇu is resting in the Kṣīrasāgara or ocean of milk) come down to help Kṛṣṇa who was Viṣṇu himself. He was an expert in fighting with gadā or mace. The plough (halā) was his favourite weapon. The <em>Bhāgavata</em> is full of his exploits. Along with Kṛṣṇa, he too killed many a demon like Pralamba, Dhenuka, Dvivida and Balvala. After the killing of Kaṁsa by Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma too got his formal education under the sage Sāndīpani. He married Revatī, the daughter of the king Revata. When the Kauravas of Hastināpura had abducted Sāmba, a son of Kṛṣṇa, he went there and rescued him. It was he who taught gadā-vidyā (the science of fighting with the mace) to Bhīma (the second of the five Pāṇḍavas) and Duryodhana (the eldest of the Kauravas). He had a soft corner for the latter.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>During the Kurukṣetra (or Mahā-bhārata) war, he refused to participate but went away on a pilgrimage. He reappeared at the time of the duel between Bhīma and Duryodhana. He tried to prevent it but did not succeed. He was cross with Bhīma for having flouted the rules of mace-fighting but was pacified by Kṛṣṇa.</p>
			<p>When the Yādavas exterminated one another in mutual fighting, Balarāma sat in yoga and left the body in the form of a serpent thus confirming that he was Ādiśeṣa.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (200 B.C.) is accepted as a basic text of yoga and has been highly venerated. In the third chapter of the work called Vibhūtipāda, various vibhūtis or siddhis (supernatural powers) that a yogi obtains by the practice of &#x2018;saṁyama&#x2019; are described; and balasiddhi is one of them. Saṁyama is a technical term used to indicate the triad of dhāraṇā (fixing the mind on the object of concentration), dhyāna (meditation) and samādhi (total absorption in the object thus chosen), practised on one and the same object. This saṁyama results in the development or manifestation of supernatural powers in the yogi.</p>
			<p>If saṁyama is practised on the strength of an elephant (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 3.24) or lion or the mythical bird Garuḍa or Hanumān (the devotee of Rāma), the yogi develops a strength similar to theirs. This is called &#x2018;balasiddhi&#x2019;.</p>

			<p>Subrahmaṇya—also known by several other names such as Kumāra, Skanda, Kārttikeya, Ṣaṇmukha and Guha—is a very popular Hindu deity in South India, especially in Tamil Nadu. He is the son of Śiva and Pārvatī and the elder brother of Gaṇeśa. Many heroic exploits are attributed to him including the leading of the armies of the gods and killing the formidable demon Tārakāsura. Most of these were accomplished when he was still a &#x2018;bāla&#x2019; or boy. Hence he is more often represented as &#x2018;Bāla-Subrahmaṇya&#x2019;. Iconographical works describe him as red in colour, with only two hands, holding a lotus in the right and keeping the left on the waist.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Like Prahlāda, Bali is another great name among the asuras or demons who were devotees of Lord Viṣṇu. Actually, he was the grandson of the former and the son of Virocana. After losing his life in a battle with Indra, the king of devas or gods, he was revived by his guru Śukrācārya. He then performed severe austerities, got some divine weapons and then usurped svarga, the Kingdom of Indra, after worsting him in the battle. When the gods appealed to Lord Viṣṇu to restore their domain back to them, Viṣṇu incarnated himself as Vāmana, the Dwarf, approached Bali, who was well-known as extraordinarily generous, for a gift of land and occupied all the three worlds in the process of receiving it. He also pushed Bali down into the nether world and restored to Indra and the gods, their lost svarga. Bali became the Indra later, in another cycle of creation, known as Sāvarṇika Manvantara. He is listed among the eight cirajīvins (those who are immortal).</p>

			<p>&#x2018;Bali&#x2019; is a technical term used for an offering of grain or cooked rice to certain gods, household divinities, spirits, animals and even lifeless objects that form a part of the householder&#x2019;s life. The bali offerings are thrown, in the mornings, in the direction of the four cardinal points or into the fire. Some of the offerings are placed near the main door, in water, in the pestle and mortar, near the bed, and so on. In the evenings bali is offered to the spirits that roam about at night.</p>
			<p>Bali also means the tax collected by the king.</p>
			<p>The word is also used to signify the living beings offered in sacrifice to fierce deities like Durgā and Kālī, as also in certain Vedic sacrifices like Paśubandha.</p>

			<p>The spread of Hindu culture in the South East Asian countries like Malaya, Java, Sumatra, Bali and Cambodia must have started as early as the 1st century of the Christian era, if not earlier. Quite a few of the kingdoms there were established by Hindu kings from India. Along with them, as also the traders who preceded them, came Hindu religion and culture including the Sanskrit language.</p>
			<p>The Bālī island (called Balidvīpa in ancient texts) (also spelt as Bali) which is a part of the present Indonesia and is situated very near the much bigger Java, is still a citadel of Hindu religion and culture. Its area is 5623 sq.kms. and the population, 2.1 millions. It is an island full of hills and forests and includes a volcano which sometimes gets active.</p>
			<p>The people follow Hindu religion quite actively. They believe in gods, spirits and other supernatural beings and their influence on human life. Appeasing these through yajñas (sacrifices) is a common feature of their religion. The sacraments of jātakarma, nāmakaraṇa, upanayana and vivāha, to be performed at the time of birth, initiation and marriage are also observed. Worship of God as the family deity is common in all the houses. Animal sacrifices to appease terrible deities like Durgā or certain demons are also common. The few rivers of the island have been named as Sindhū, Gaṅgā and Kāverī though their waters are not considered as sacred. The caste system is very much prevalent and the brāhmaṇa has an important place in all religious activities. Influence of the Sanskrit language is also clearly seen.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Balipīṭha or a pedestal where balis or food offerings are made, is an essential part of a Hindu temple. Situated usually near the dhvajastambha or the flagpost, but nearer the shrine, it is a raised platform made of stone, the height being generally one-eighth that of the garbha-gṛha or the <em>sanctum sactorum</em>. Materials other than stone, like metal, mud or bricks, may also be used.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>The balipīṭha may be square, rectangular, octagonal, sixteen-sided or circular; and will have several tiers, each tier providing space for a particular class of celestial beings like the dikpālas (guardian deities of the quarters), apsarās (celestial nymphs), piśācas (goblins) and so on, to receive the food offered.</p>
			<p>After the main deity is served with naivedya or food, the priests begin a procession for feeding the guardian deities and minor deities. The first one to receive the offering is the &#x2018;balibera&#x2019; or the movable metallic image, which is then carried in the procession. After circumambulating the main deity, the food offering is kept on the balipīṭha.</p>
			<p>Balis or food-offerings are given only in the temple worship and not in the worship at home.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Considered as one of the three most holy days of the Hindu Calendar, Bali-prati-padā falls on the Kārttika śukla-pratipad (first day of the bright fortnight of the month Kārttika, generally in November). It is also one of the three days of the Dīpāvalī (also spelt as Divālī) festival, the festival of lights. It was on this day, according to the Hindu mythology, that Bali, the emperor of the asuras or demons, was conquered by Lord Viṣṇu and was granted several boons since he was a great devotee.</p>
			<p>Worship of an image of Bali along with that of his consort Vindhyāvalī, is an important item of the festival, especially for kings. Gifts given on this day produce manifold results.</p>
			<p>Worship of cows and bulls as also the hill Govardhana (See <ref>ANNAKŪṬA</ref>.), tying of the Mārgapālī (lit., protectress of the road) or a rope of kuśa grass between a pole and a tree across a road and passing under it, and playing dice, are some of the items generally observed during this festival. A paurāṇic story of the game of dice between Śiva and Pārvatī seems to be at the back of this practice of dice-play. Hence the name &#x2018;Dyūtapratipadā&#x2019; also for this day.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, a ceremonial tug-of-war is also arranged in front of a temple or the palace, between the princely class and the commoners, the latter always &#x2018;winning&#x2019; at the end! Occasionally, images of Agni and Brahmā are established on a ratha or chariot and worshipped. The chariot is then drawn round the streets of the town. Hence this festival is also called &#x2018;Balipratipadā-rathayātrāvrata&#x2019;.</p>

			<p>Bāṇa or Bāṇāsura was the eldest son of the demon king Bali. He was a great devotee of Lord Śiva and had obtained several boons from him. Aniruddha, the grandson of Kṛṣṇa, had surreptitiously married Bāṇa&#x2019;s daughter Uṣā at her request. This led to a war between Kṛṣṇa and Bāṇa in which the latter was defeated.</p>
			<p>Bāṇa is also the name of another asura or demon who had constructed three flying cities. At the behest of the gods like Indra, Śiva spared his life and permitted him to live in the Svarṇapura (the golden city).</p>

			<p>Though several stones shaped like a liṅga are found in the river Narmadā, not all of them are bāṇaliṅgas. Special charac-teristics are prescribed for them by noting which one can discover a true bāṇaliṅga.</p>
			<p>The bāṇaliṅgas occur in many shapes and sizes as also colours. They are hence given different names. The &#x2018;āgneya-liṅga&#x2019; will be rose in colour and warm to touch. The &#x2018;yāmya-liṅga&#x2019; is shaped like a cudgel whereas the &#x2018;varuṇa-liṅga&#x2019; is round in shape. The &#x2018;raudra-liṅga&#x2019; resembles a bone-piece. The &#x2018;vaiṣṇava-liṅga&#x2019; has varie-gated colours. They are sometimes given different names of Śiva—like Svayambhū, Mṛtyuñjaya or Nīlakaṇṭha—depending upon their external characteristics.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These words which mean &#x2018;bondage,&#x2019; have been used in the Indian philosophical literature in a more technical sense, that of the bondage of the ātman (or soul) due to various factors. Generally, all the six well-known schools of philosophy accept that bandha or bondage has been caused by avidyā, ajñāna or mithyājñāna (ignorance or false knowledge of the Reality) and mokṣa or liberation comes through jñāna or right knowledge and experience of the Reality.</p>
			<p>For details see under each of the six systems of Indian philosophy.</p>
			<p>In Haṭhayoga, the word bandha or mudrā is used to indicate the various methods prescribed for controlling the prāṇa or the vital airs and arousing the kuṇḍalinīśakti, the basic psycho-spiritual energy situated at the root of the spinal column.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;bandhu&#x2019; used in early Vedic literature meant a &#x2018;friend.&#x2019; Later, it was used to indicate any relative or blood-relation, in general. Gradually, by the time of the medieval digests of dharmaśāstras, it acquired a more technical or legal sense, since a clear definition of the word was all important in cases of rights to the property of a deceased person. Hence it was defined as a person related to the deceased through one or more female relatives (cognate) as opposed to the gotrajas (agnates) or relatives through the male members of the family. Elaborate details with regard to the line of succession have been provided by the dharmaśāstras.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Situated near the place where the river Jhelum (Vedic river Vitastā) leaves the Kashmir valley, the modern Baramula was called Varāhamūlakṣetra or Varāha-kṣetra in the ancient days. Originally, it was a suburb of Huviṣkapura (modern Ushkur). Associated with the Ādivarāha, the boar incarnation of Viṣṇu, it was considered very sacred. Consequently many temples and monasteries had been built in the 9th and 10th centuries, during the reigns of Lalitāditya Muktāpīḍa, (Queen) Sugandhā, and Kṣemagupta, when the cult of Viṣṇu flourished there. These were later destroyed by Sikandar Būṭ-Ṣikān during the period A. D. 1390-1416. Only a few columns and tablets of stone remain now as a remnant of the old glory.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Vaiṣṇava movement in Assam owes its origin mainly to Śaṅkaradeva (A.D. 1486-1568). He and his chief disciple Mādhavadeva have left behind them a class of devotional poems and songs in Assamese, well-known as &#x2018;bargīt&#x2019; (&#x2018;vara-gītam or excellent songs&#x2019;) which still hold their sway upon the masses of Assam.</p>
			<p>These lyrical songs are classical as far as musical techniques are concerned. Their content however is highly philosophical, though stories of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa also find a place.</p>
			<p>The bargīts of Śaṅkaradeva are full of dāsyabhakti (devotion to God as of a servant towards his master) whereas those of Mādhavadeva excel in Vātsalyabhakti (devotion to God considering him as one&#x2019;s child).</p>
			<p>Later writers like Gopāladeva, Ani-ruddha, Śrīrāma and others, who were mostly pontiffs of Vaiṣṇavite monasteries (called &#x2018;Sattras&#x2019;) imitated these bargīts and attained some distinction in this field.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;measure of Bṛhaspati&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Bārhaspatya-māna is a method of reckoning time in cycles of 60 years (<em>Sūryasiddhānta</em> 14.1-2) which is quite common in South India even now. The sidereal period of Bṛhaspati or planet Jupiter is nearly 112 sidereal years. Hence Jupiter stays roughly for one year in one zodiacal sign, if the calculation is based on mean motion.</p>
			<p>This led to the devising of a cycle of 12 Jovian years of about 361 days each. At some period, a fivefold multiple, a cycle of 60 Jovian or Bārhaspatya years, each with a special name suffixed by the word saṁvatsara (= year) came into use. The earliest available evidence points to the 6th century A. D., as found in the inscription of the Cālukyan king Maṅgaleśa.</p>
			<p>The sixty years are:</p>
			<p>1. Prabhava; 2. Vibhava; 3. Śukla; 4. Pramodūta; 5. Prajotpatti (Prajāpati); 6. Aṅgiras; 7. Śrīmukha; 8. Bhāva; 9. Yuvan; 10. Dhātṛ (Dhātu); 11. Īśvara; 12. Bahudhānya; 13. Pramāthin; 14. Vikrama; 15. Vṛṣan (Viṣu); 16. Citrabhānu; 17. Subhānu (Svabhānu); 18. Tāraṇa; 19. Pārthiva; 20. Vyaya; 21. Sarvajit; 22. Sarvadhārin; 23. Virodhin; 24. Vikṛti; 25. Khara; 26. Nandana; 27. Vijaya; 28. Jaya; 29. Manmatha; 30. Durmukha; 31. Hevilambin (Hemalambin); 32. Vilambin; 33. Vikārin; 34. Śārvarin; 35. Plava; 36. Śubhakṛt; 37. Śobhakṛt; (Śobhana); 38. Krodhin; 39.Viśvāvasu; 40. Parābhava; 41. Plavaṅga; 42. Kīlaka; 43. Saumya; 44. Sādhāraṇa; 45. Virodhikṛt; 46. Parī-dhāvin; 47. Pramādin; 48. Ānanda; 49. Rākṣasa; 50. Anala; 51. Piṅgala; 52. Kālayukta; 53. Siddhārtha; 54. Raudra; 55. Durmati; 56. Dundubhi; 57. Rudhirodgāra; 58. Raktākṣa (Raktākṣin); 59. Krodhana; 60. Kṣaya (Akṣaya).</p>
			<p>It was believed that the Saṁvatsara names indicated different consequences for the years concerned.</p>
			<p>Since the Jovian year is only 361 days long, shorter than a solar year by 4 or 5 days, it became necessary to expunge one Jovian year in every 85 or 86 solar years. This is called a &#x2018;Kṣaya-saṁvatsara.&#x2019;</p>

			<p>Vedic sacrifices involve a lot of details to be looked into while organizing their performance. One such is the spreading of the kuśa grass (<em>Poa cynosuroides</em>) in the sacrificial shed, and more so on the vedi (sacrificial platform) upon which the sacrificial vessels and oblations are kept. The seat of the performers and the place where the gods invited to receive the offerings are expected to be seated, are also situated here. This place thus covered with the kuśa grass, is called &#x2018;barhis&#x2019;.</p>

			<word>Basaveśvara</word>
			<note>(death—A. D. 1168)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Vīraśaivism, one of the important aspects of Śaivism, more popular in Karnataka, owes its development and popularity mainly to Basaveśvara, also called Basavaṇṇa or Basava, who flourished in the 12th century. Though attempts have been made to project him as the founder of the faith, others in the tradition have not accepted it, since quite a few teachers of the same school have preceded him.</p>
			<p>The socio-political condition of the people of Karnataka during the latter part of the 11th and early part of the 12th centuries, was ripe for the advent of a rebel-reformer and Basaveśvara fitted into it admirably. The brāhmaṇas with the strength of their learning in the traditional lore and secular sciences as also their cultural roots, wielded enormous power both in the political field and in the social set-up. The caste system had an iron grip over the society and persons of lower castes enjoyed few privileges but several disabilities. Their colossal ignorance and arrant superstition had created many a deified spirit, the fear of which had led to several ridiculous practices.</p>
			<p>Women in general were always treated as inferior to men. Jainism, as a result of constant conflict with the various cults of Hinduism, had lost its popular appeal.</p>
			<p>Basaveśvara was born as the son of a śaiva brāhmaṇa couple—Mādirāja and Mādāmbā, at Bāgevāḍi in the Bijapur district of modern Karnataka. Since he was born after much austerity and prayers to Vṛṣabha or Nandinātha (the bullmount of Śiva) he was christened &#x2018;Basava&#x2019; (= vṛṣabha). Though brought up in the Vedic brāhmanical tradition he could not reconcile himself to many of the customs that obtained during his times like immolating animals in Vedic sacrifices. Most unwillingly and under protest, he underwent the upanayana ceremony (the ceremony of investiture with the sacred thread called yajñopavīta). He was given a good education which he could assimilate well, due to the unusual powers of comprehension. However, he could not bring himself to accept the various rituals of Vedic origin. Nor could he tolerate the injustice being heaped upon the lower caste groups by the upper classes. This gradually led to a lot of bad blood between him and his parents as also the elders in the contem-porary society. Meanwhile his parents passed away leaving him an orphan. He thought he was now free to come out of the clutches of brāhminical orthodoxy, which he did, by tearing off the sacred thread that symbolized it. He then went to Kappaḍi Saṅgama, a holy place situated at the confluence of the rivers Malaprabhā and Kṛṣṇā. He settled down near the temple of Saṅgameśvara and started his spiritual quest through the worship of the Śivaliṅga there. A holy man Īśānya-guru by name, is said to have given him shelter there.</p>
			<p>It is not known how long Basaveśvara stayed at Kappaḍi Saṅgama. Once Śiva appeared to him in a dream and commanded him to go to Maṅgaḷiveḍa and meet the King Bijjaḷa. He did so, though most unwillingly.</p>
			<p>Bijjaḷa of the Kalacuri race, who had been a governor of the Cālukyas had, gradually grown in power and had usurped their kingdom during the period A.D. 1157-62.</p>
			<p>Being impressed by the appearance and personal magnetism of Basaveśvara, Bijjaḷa appointed him as an employee in his treasury under Siddha Daṇḍādhipa. After the latter&#x2019;s demise, Basaveśvara took over as the chief. Soon after this, he got married to Gaṅgādevī and Nīlalocanā, daughters of two high-ranking officers.</p>
			<p>Neither wealth nor power, nor even happy family could deflect Basaveśvara from his chosen path: worship of Śiva and serving the jaṅgamas and śaraṇas (Vīraśaiva ascetics and devotees). His hospitality and generosity soon attracted all and sundry to his house in the guise of devotees of Śiva. Though sometimes, he had to suffer their quixotic behaviour, he would do so with infinite patience and cheerfulness.</p>
			<p>Sometime later, Basaveśvara shifted to Kalyāṇa, the capital of Bijjaḷa. Though he worked honestly and efficiently, rumours floated by persons inimical to him—like misuse of state funds for entertaining his personal guests—gradually soured his relationship with Bijjaḷa. Added to it was the attempt he made to bring about a social revolution that would transcend caste barriers, accord an equal status to women and stress the importance of honest physical labour as an integral part of religious or spiritual life. This he did by founding an institution called &#x2018;Śivānubhava-maṇṭapa&#x2019; (&#x2018;religious house of experience&#x2019;). This was, perhaps, the birth-place or cradle of Vīraśaivism as known to us today. It was a spiritual as well as a social institution organized by Basaveśvara and presided over by Allama Prabhu, the greatest saint of the times. It acted as a nucleus round which gathered persons of all ranks and professions including women, to take part in the discussions that ranged from the most sublime spiritual truths to social problems, norms and conduct.</p>
			<p>The social revolution that was initiated by this movement developed from a ripple to gigantic waves resulting ultimately in the marriage of a brāhmaṇa girl to a Harijan (untouchable) boy since both the families had embraced the Vīraśaiva cult. This naturally led to a great commotion and social unrest resulting first in the plucking out of the eyes of the fathers of the couple by Bijjaḷa and then in the assassination of Bijjaḷa himself at the hands of Basaveśvara&#x2019;s followers as a reaction. In the melee that resulted, Basaveśvara escaped to Kappaḍi Saṅgama; and later, he voluntarily drowned himself at the confluence of the rivers there.</p>
			<p>Basaveśvara, though a social revolutionary, was basically a spiritual aspirant who rose to saintly heights. His devotion to his Lord, &#x2018;Kūḍala Saṅgamadeva (Śiva),&#x2019; was as intense as his keen intellect. He used everything he had—wealth and possessions, power, good name—in the service of his Lord and His devotees. He was a byword for magnanimity and generosity.</p>
			<p>He has left behind him a large number of his sayings as &#x2018;vacanas.&#x2019; The vacana is a class of Kannada literature, midway between prose and poetry, and couched in the common language of the masses. The topics dealt with range from the deepest philosophical reflections, to simple ethics or problems and parodies of the day-to-day life.</p>
			<p>His philosophy may be summarized briefly thus: Have a great ideal in life, to live by. Try hard, try sincerely, to stick to that ideal or to reach it. Be fearless and face all the problems that may have to be encountered while trying to live that life. Do not neglect the life here and now; because, if it is lived well &#x2018;here,&#x2019; you can live well &#x2018;there&#x2019; also. Do some constructive physical labour to earn your livelihood or to deserve the food that you eat. Be contented with what you have and try to share the good things of your life with others. Since spiritual evolution is more important than the status in society brought about by caste, the latter has to be overlooked in favour of the former.</p>
			<p>There is no doubt that Basaveśvara was one of the brightest luminaries that adorned South India, especially the Karnataka region, in the 12th century.</p>

			<p>The aim of human life is to get spiri-tual illumination. This can be achieved only by strenuous sādhanā or spiritual discipline. The body is an invaluable instrument in this process of sādhanā. This body may wear out before time due to impurities in the internal systems. The science of Haṭhayoga has devised several simple methods for correcting the internal disorders through cleansing processes. They are six in number and are called &#x2018;ṣaṭkarmas&#x2019; (ṣat = six). The second of these six is &#x2018;basti.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Basti is the process of cleansing the intestines. It is of two types: jalabasti and sthala or śuṣka-basti. The first is practised in water and the second on land.</p>
			<p>Jalabasti is yogic enema, practised in navel deep water, by sitting in utkaṭāsana and alternately contracting and expanding the anus muscle (the sphincter).</p>
			<p>When the same is practised on land, it becomes sthalabasti (sthala = land, ground) or śuṣka-basti (śuṣka = dry). However, paścimottānāsana is recommended for this basti.</p>
			<p>Gastric troubles, wind troubles, constipation, cough and bile complaints are said to be cured by these two bastis.</p>
			<p>It is advisable to practise them under the care and guidance of an expert.</p>

			<word>Baudhāyana</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;descendant of Bodhāyana&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the ancient but well-known names met with in the Vedāṅga literature, is that of Baudhāyāna. Baudhāyana is a descendant of Bodhāyana who himself is a son of Bodha. However, nothing is known of this Bodha.</p>
			<p>The two names Bodhāyana and Baudhāyana have sometimes been used as if they are synonymous. A Kāṇva Bodhā-yana, mentioned in the <em>Baudhāyana-dharmasūtras</em>, is perhaps a more ancient teacher, and, may be a predecessor.</p>
			<p>Baudhāyana probably existed somewhere during the period 600-300 B.C., and belonged to South India. This surmise is based on the fact that Sāyaṇa (14th cent. A.D.) the great commentator on the Vedas, was a descendant of Baudhāyana. Practically nothing is known about him.</p>
			<p>Baudhāyana is one of the very few authors whose work is available on all the four branches of Kalpa, the last of the six Vedāṅgas. They are: śrautasūtras, gṛhyasūtras, dharmasūtras and śulba-sūtras.</p>
			<p>The extant work of Baudhāyana consists of six sections (each called &#x2018;sūtra&#x2019;) as follows: the <em>Śrautasūtras</em>, the <em>Dvaidha-sūtras,</em> the <em>Karmāntasūtras</em>, the <em>Gṛhya-sūtras, </em>the<em> Dharmasūtras</em> and the <em>Śulba-sūtras.</em></p>
			<p>The <em>Śrautasūtras</em>, considered as very ancient, has 30 praśnas or sections, each divided into several adhyāyas or chapters. It is in prose and the sentences are rather long. The whole work deals with the details of Vedic sacrifices of various types like Agnihotra, Darśapūrṇamāsa, Cāturmāsya, Vājapeya, Aśvamedha and so on.</p>
			<p>The <em>Dvaidhasūtras</em> which deals with vaikalpika vidhis or choices given with regard to any particular rule and the <em>Karmāntasūtras</em> which deals with the rest of the injunctions not given earlier, form a part of the <em>Śrautasūtras</em>.</p>
			<p>The last praśna of the <em>Śrautasūtras</em> is the <em>Śulbasūtras</em>. It deals with the geometrical and mechanical details of constructing the sacrificial vedi or altar.</p>
			<p>The <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em> is in 4 praśnas or sections, comprising 47 adhyāyas or chapters. The subjects dealt with include the sixteen saṁskāras or sacraments, like jātakarma (rites to be performed at birth), nāmakaraṇa (naming ceremony), upanayana (investiture with yajñopavīta or the sacred thread to mark the beginning of Vedic studies), vivāha (marriage) and so on. Other topics dealt with in the work are: certain rites like Vaiśvadevahoma and prāyaścittas or expiatory rites for transgressing rules while performing the Vedic rites described earlier.</p>
			<p>In some printed books, three more works are added as appendices. They are <em>Gṛhyaparibhāṣāsūtram, Gṛhyaśeṣasūtram</em> and <em>Pitṛmedhasūtram.</em> Some scholars however, consider these also as an integral part of the <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em>. The first work in two praśnas and 23 adhyāyas defines the various terms used in Vedic sacrifices. The second in 5 praśnas and 97 adhyāyas, fills up the gap as it were, in the performance of the Vedic rites described earlier, by giving the details of the rituals left out. The third or the last, comprising 3 praśnas and 48 adhyāyas deals almost exclusively with the aurdhvadehika rites (rites to be performed after death).</p>
			<p>The <em>Dharmasūtras</em>, also considered as an ancient work, is in 4 praśnas or khaṇḍas (sections), the last praśna being considered as a later interpolation by some scholars. The topics dealt with are: sources of dharma, upanayana and duties of a brahmacārin (Vedic student), duties of a snātaka (one who has completed the study of the Vedas) and eight forms of marriage, prāyaścittas or expiatory rites for sins, the sandhyā ritual, the pañcayajñas or the five daily sacrifices, śrāddha cere-monies connected with death and post-death rituals, saṁnyāsa or rites to be performed to become a monk, means of securing siddhis or supernatural powers and so on.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the crazy ones&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Bāuls of rural Bengal who are found even today, form one of the obscure religious cults of India. They are wandering minstrels comprising mostly mendicants.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;bāul,&#x2019; of uncertain origin, may have been derived from either of the Sanskrit words: Vātula (affected by wind-disease, i.e., mad or crazy) or vyākula (impatiently eager). Both these derivations are consistent with the modern sense of the word: &#x2018;inspired people with an ecstatic eagerness for a spiritual life, leading to ultimate union with the eternal Beloved.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Historically, this sect might have been derived from the Nātha Cult. However, the influence of Vaiṣṇavism and Sūfism can easily be recognized.</p>
			<p>The Bāuls are most unconventional in their customs and manners, habits and practices. They pride themselves on calling their ways as &#x2018;ulṭa&#x2019; or &#x2018;the reverse&#x2019;. That is why they care not for formal observances of any religious practice.</p>
			<p>The literature of the Bāuls is entirely in their songs and poems (in Bengali) couched in mystic terms and riddles. Whatever philosophy can be gleaned from these can be stated briefly as follows:</p>
			<p>The human body is the microcosm of the universe, the temple of the Dear one. This Beloved, also called &#x2018;maner mānuṣ&#x2019; (&#x2018;the Man of the Heart&#x2019;) is the Lord of the universe living in our heart. Hence, any search for Him outside is fruitless. This Divine Personality residing in us is our essential nature, love is the means of achieving union with Him and the lover is the human personality. In the highest union, all limitations are transcended, all differences between humanity and divinity are annihilated.</p>
			<p>Madan, Biśa Bhūmimāli, Īśān Yugi, Kṛṣṇakānta Pāṭhak and Lālan Fakīr are some of the celebrated composers of the bāul songs.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Worship of images is an integral part of Hindu religion. Arcā or image is one of the several forms of manifestation of the Divine. Another term which is commonly used in the āgamas for images, but in a more technical sense, is &#x2018;bera&#x2019;. This word, of uncertain origin, is generally employed to indicate images made to conform to the prescriptions of mūrtiśilpaśāstra or icono-graphy and used in worship.</p>
			<p>A bera should be either &#x2018;citra&#x2019; (solid figure) or &#x2018;citrārdha&#x2019; (relief figure). Painted or engraved figures are not classed under &#x2018;bera&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The height and the width of the bera are taken as standards for determining other measurements like those of the pīṭha or pedestal, of the garbhagṛha or the cella, or, the vimāna (the tower over the main shrine). (See <ref>AṄGULA </ref>and <ref>TĀLAMĀNA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>Beras can be of two general types: acala or immovable and cala or movable and portable. The acalabera, also called &#x2018;dhruvabera&#x2019; (the constant icon) or &#x2018;mūlabera&#x2019; (the original icon), is the original image, of stone, permanently fixed in the sanctuary. The calaberas can be as many as four and are made of metal. Along with the original (dhruvabera) they are collectively called &#x2018;Pañcaberas&#x2019; (five icons).</p>
			<p>The first in the series is the &#x2018;kautukabera,&#x2019; also called &#x2018;kriyābera&#x2019; and &#x2018;karmārcā&#x2019;, kept in the central part of the altar in the shrine. Life is infused into it from the main image and all the items of worship of the main image are also offered to this image. The second is the &#x2018;snapanabera,&#x2019; an image that receives the daily ceremonial bath. This image is sometimes designated as &#x2018;tīrthasnānārcā,&#x2019; also. The next is the &#x2018;utsavabera&#x2019; or &#x2018;utsavārcā&#x2019; or &#x2018;rathabera&#x2019;, which is meant to be taken out in procession on festival days. The fourth is the &#x2018;balibera&#x2019; or &#x2018;balyarcā&#x2019;, an image that receives the food offerings meant to be distributed among the attendant and minor deities. It is taken out in a procession at the time of baliharaṇa or distribution of food offerings to these deities. Some texts add another, &#x2018;śayanārcā&#x2019;, the image which is put to rest during night. These divisions of beras are found mostly in the Vaiṣṇavāgamas. The Śaivāgamas sometimes add a &#x2018;nṛttabera,&#x2019; a Naṭarāja icon employed on certain occasions like aridrotsava.</p>

			<word>Besnagar Inscription</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Inscription on stone pillars and walls as also on metal plates have always been a source of valuable material for reconstructing ancient or medieval Indian history. One such, belonging to a fairly early period (2nd century B.C.) is the Besnagar inscription, discovered on a &#x2018;garuḍadhvaja&#x2019; (votive pillar with the sculpture of Garuḍa, the mythical bird-mount of Viṣṇu) near Bhilsa in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
			<p>Besnagar was the capital of the Śuṅga dynasty which ruled during the period 187-75 B.C.</p>
			<p>The stone pillar has been dedicated to Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa), called &#x2018;deva-deva&#x2019; or &#x2018;God of gods&#x2019;, by Heliodoros who was a Yavana or a Greek. In the inscription on it, he calls himself as a &#x2018;paramabhāgavata&#x2019; (the best of the bhāgavatas or devotees of Viṣṇu). He was the son of one Diya and a native of Takṣaśilā. He had been deputed as the ambassador by the Greek King Antialcidas to the Indian King Bhaga-bhadra Kāśīputra, probably the same as the fifth Śuṅga King Bhadraka.</p>
			<p>This inscription proves two things, viz., that the Kṛṣṇa-Vāsudeva cult or the Bhāgavata religion had already become quite popular and that even Greeks of high descent had gladly accepted it. Incidentally, this also helps us to prove the historicity of Kṛṣṇa.</p>

			<word>Bhadrācalam</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;mountain of Bhadra&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bhadrācalam—also known as Bhadra-giri—is considered as one of the 25 important places of pilgrimage associated with Śrī Rāma. It is situated in the Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh. It is 50 kms. (31 miles) from Kothagudem, the place famous for the coal mines of Singareni.</p>
			<p>The sanctum of the temple has all the three images, of Śrī Rāma, Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa. According to the sthalapurāṇa (local mythological accounts), the three appeared before the sage Bhadra (personification of the mountain Bhadragiri, consi-dered as the son of Meruparvata or mountain Meru and Menakā) and transformed themselves into stone images at his request, to stay there permanently. An anthill grew over the images and they were hidden from the human gaze for centuries.</p>
			<p>The presence there of the images was revealed accidentally or by divine dispensation to one Pokala Dammakka, a childless widow who had adopted a boy named Rāma. She retrieved the images and preserved them, offering a simple worship. One day in a dream she saw the sage Bhadra who instructed her to keep up her devoted worship until such a time when a great devotee of Śrī Rāma will come and construct a temple for the images. Later, when Kañcarla Gopanna (A. D. 1630-1687) who was the tax-collector of the Muslim ruler Tanisha visited the place, she revealed her dream to him. Since he was a great devotee of Śrī Rāma, he got the temple built. Though he was punished by the ruler for the &#x2018;misuse&#x2019; of State funds, Śrī Rāma came to his rescue in a miraculous way.</p>
			<p>Gopanna became a famous composer-musician, now well-known as Bhadrācala Rāmadāsa.</p>
			<p>The temple was built in the 17th century and was thoroughly renovated during the 1960&#x2019;s.</p>
			<p>Śrī Rāma-Navamī and Vaikuṇṭha Ekādaśī are the biggest festivals conducted in this temple.</p>
			<p>Temples of Narasiṁha and Govinda-rāja as also the Rāmadāsa Dhyānamandira are places of importance for the pilgrims.</p>
			<p>About 36 kms. (20 miles) away is the Parṇaśālā where Śrī Rāma and Sīta stayed, before Sītā was abducted by Rāvaṇa, the demon-king. A rivulet, Śītāvāga by name, flows nearby.</p>
			<p>Dummaguḍem (16 kms. or 10 miles from Bhadrācalam) where Śrī Rāma is said to have killed Khara and his army of 14,000 demons, as also Guṇḍala (5 kms. or 3 miles down the river, from Bhadrā-calam) containing hot springs are other places of interest.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Worship of God as Mother has been in vogue in India since the most ancient times. Out of the several aspects of the Mother Goddess that are still worshipped, an overwhelming majority are forms of Pārvatī or Śakti, the consort of Śiva. Bhadrakālī is one of them.</p>
			<p>Since &#x2018;bhadra&#x2019; means auspiciousness, Bhadrakālī is a pleasing deity with a charming appearance. She is depicted as seated on a chariot drawn by four lions. She has eighteen hands in which she carries things such as rosary, trident, sword, shield, bow and arrow, conch, discus, sacrificial ladles, holy water-pot, spear and so on. One of the hands is raised in the gesture of benediction.</p>
			<p>The girl-child of Yaśodā which was brought to the prison by Vasudeva, the father of Kṛṣṇa, after exchanging it with baby Kṛṣṇa, and which Kaṁsa tried to kill, was also Bhadrakālī. She is an aspect of Durgā.</p>
			<p>The <em>Kālikāpurāṇa</em> (ch. 59) however describes Bhadrakālī as an aspect of Durgā, and as an exceedingly terrible deity. The demon Mahiṣāsura saw her in dream and was stricken with mortal fear. He worshipped her and got the boon to be killed directly by her. She also granted an additional boon that he too would be worshipped in future along with her.</p>
			<p>According to another account Bhadra-kālī was the female companion of Vīra-bhadra, who had been created by Śiva out of a hair from his matted locks to destroy Dakṣa&#x2019;s sacrifice.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Āsanas or yogāsanas are various postures of the body aimed at freeing it from diseases and improving its health, energy and stamina. Out of the 32 āsanas most commonly practised, bhadrāsana is one. In this posture, one has to sit on one&#x2019;s knees, allowing the calf-muscles touch the thighs. Hands should be taken to the back and catch hold of the toes with the fingers. This should be followed by Jālandhara-bandha, wherein the gaze is fixed on the tip on the nose.</p>
			<p>In another variety, the hands have to cross each other. The right hand should hold the left toe and the left, the right toe.</p>
			<p>This āsana is said to cure the stiffness of bones and rigidity of ligaments.</p>
			<p>In iconographical works, it represents a golden throne with cushions.</p>

			<word>Bhaga</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bhaga is one of the twelve Ādityas (solar deities of the Vedas) born to Kaśyapa Prajāpati and his wife Aditi.</p>
			<p>According to another view he is classed among the eleven Rudras.</p>
			<p>He is said to be the lord of the month Puṣya (January-February). It is quite likely that the twelve Ādityas are the twelve aspects of the sun spread over the twelve months and the aspect connected with the month Puṣya is named Bhaga.</p>
			<p>There was one Bhaga in the sacrificial assembly of Dakṣa Prajāpati. He too like others was subjected to the wrath of Vīrabhadra, the terrible emissary of Śiva, and lost his eyes.</p>
			<p>The word bhaga represents the group of six guṇas or blessed qualities: aiśvarya (lordship), dharma (righteousness), yaśas (renown), śrī (splendour), jñāna (know-ledge) and vairāgya (detachment). One who possesses these in abundance is &#x2018;Bhagavān.&#x2019; The term is generally applied to God; and even to sages and prophets. When applied to a goddess it becomes &#x2018;Bhagavatī.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Sometimes these six guṇas are listed in a slightly different way: jñāna, aiśvarya, śakti (ability), bala (strength), vīrya (viri-lity) and tejas (splendour). They are considered as the material or instruments of śuddhasṛṣṭi or pure creation. They also play a part in the manifestation of vyūhas or emanations from God Vāsudeva viz., Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha.</p>

			<word>Bhagavadgītā</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;Song of God&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, popularly known as the <em>Gītā</em>, is one of the outstanding religious classics of the world. Hindus, irrespective of their sects and denomi-nations, cherish great reverence for this book. A ceremonial reading of the book or even a part there 	of, is believed to confer great religious merit.</p>
			<p>The book itself, comprising eighteen chapters, forms an integral part of a much bigger work, the great epic <em>Mahābhārata</em> (<em>vide</em> <em>Bhīṣmaparva</em>, chapters 25 to 42). It is a poetical work in the form of a dialogue between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra. The setting of the battlefield contributes a dramatic element to the book and relates religion to the realities of life.</p>
			<p>The greatness and the popularity of the <em>Gītā</em> can be attributed to several factors. It is part and parcel of the epic <em>Mahābhārata</em> which itself has been highly venerated as the fifth Veda (<em>Pañcama-Veda).</em> The teacher of the<em> Gītā</em> is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is regarded by the Hindus as an avatāra or incarnation of God Himself. An ideal friend, a great statesman, an invincible warrior, a wise preceptor and a yogi <em>par excellence</em> he harmonizes in his life the various conflicting activities of life. It is precisely this that makes him the fittest person to preach such a religio-spiritual classic. Arjuna, the recipient of the teaching, though himself a great warrior, is a typical representative of the humans, easily liable to be upset or confused during periods of crisis. Hence, his predicament, very much represents ours, in a similar situation. The questions, doubts and misgivings he raises and the solutions that Śrī Kṛṣṇa offers are not only relevant but also valid even today.</p>
			<p>There is an additional reason too. The Hindu Vedāntic tradition has always regarded the prasthānatraya (the three foundational works) as its basis; and the <em>Gītā</em> is one of them, the other two being the Upaniṣads and the <em>Brahmasūtras.</em> That is why Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) and other ancient teachers have chosen to write commentaries on it.</p>
			<p>Since the <em>Gītā</em> is an integral part of the epic <em>Mahābhārata</em>, its date and authorship are obviously the same as those of the epic itself. (See <ref>MAHĀBHĀRATA</ref>.) Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, better known as Vedavyāsa, is reputed to be its author. As per the Hindu oral traditions based on their notion of time as the yuga-system, the Kurukṣetra war must have taken place during 3139 B.C. The dates given however by the modern historians and scholars (mostly of the West) vary from 1424 B.C. to 575 B.C. At the present stage of research, it may be difficult to clinch the issue on such chronological matters.</p>
			<p>The widely accepted present text of the <em>Gītā</em> is based on the one chosen by Śaṅkara, the earliest of the traditional commentators. It consists of 700 ślokas or verses spread over 18 chapters. The following is a brief summary of the book, arranged chapterwise.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 1 (<em>Arjuna-viṣāda-yoga</em>, 47 verses)</h1>
			<p>Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava hero, shaken by the prospect of killing the venerable Bhīṣma and the preceptor Droṇa, gets into a despondent mood at the start of the war. He describes the horrendous fallout of such wars, and lays down his arms refusing to fight.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 2 (<em>Sāṅkhya-yoga</em>, 72 verses)</h1>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, at first, admonishes Arjuna for his unmanly and ignominious behaviour. This, however, falls on deaf ears. Hence he is obliged into giving a long philosophical discourse. Since the soul inhabiting bodies, is immortal, one should not grieve over death and destruction. It is Arjuna&#x2019;s duty to fight this righteous war and win it or become a martyr if necessary, but never yield to unrighteousness. Work done as duty, in a spirit of detachment and for public good, ultimately leads to perfection. A perfect man (called &#x2018;sthitaprajña&#x2019; here) is equanimous under all the vicissitudes of life.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 3 (<em>Karmayoga</em>, 43 verses)</h1>
			<p>Clearing Arjuna&#x2019;s doubts regarding the conflict between jñāna (knowledge), which envisages renunciation and karma (work, action) Śrī Kṛṣṇa opines that the path of karma is easier and better for most people. Citing the example of ancient kings like Janaka and of his own, he urges Arjuna not to relinquish work, but to perform his duties without selfish motives.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 4 (<em>Jñāna-yoga</em>)</h1>
			<p>While reminiscing how Karmayoga or the yoga of action taught by him in the ancient days to Vivasvān and others got lost in course of time, Śrī Kṛṣṇa reveals that he is God Himself come down to save dharma or righteousness. He incarnates here out of his own will whenever dharma declines, to put it on a firm foundation. He extols the greatness of jñāna or spiritual wisdom.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 5 (<em>Karma-saṁnyāsa-yoga</em>, 29 verses)</h1>
			<p>Answering a question from Arjuna whether karma-saṁnyāsa (renunciation of action) or Karmayoga (yoga of action) is better, Śrī Kṛṣṇa avers that the latter is better for him. What is needed is equanimity while doing karma.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 6 (<em>Dhyānayoga</em>, 47 verses)</h1>
			<p>In this chapter Śrī Kṛṣṇa describes the process of dhyāna or meditation. Place and posture suitable for meditation as also the methods of controlling the mind are graphically depicted.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 7 (<em>Jñāna-vijñāna-yoga</em>, 30 verses)</h1>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord, has created the whole universe, drawing upon his twofold prakṛti or nature. It is he that is holding together all beings and things. Only those that surrender themselves to him can transcend his māyā or power of delusion.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 8 (<em>Akṣarabrahmayoga</em>, 28 verses)</h1>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa describes here how a person remembering Him at the moment of death attains Him. Repetition of praṇava or Om at this juncture is a great help. He also mentions the two well-known paths—arcirādimārga and dhūmādimārga, the paths of light and smoke—which the jīvas or embodied beings take to after death.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 9 (<em>Rājavidyā-rājaguhya-yoga</em>, 34 verses)</h1>
			<p>Continuing the discourse, Śrī Kṛṣṇa gives here the esoteric wisdom by which Arjuna can get liberation. He is everything in creation. If people can worship him with devotion, offering him even insigni-ficant things like a flower, or a leaf or water, he accepts them and blesses them. His devotee never perishes in life.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 10 (<em>Vibhūtiyoga</em>, 42 verses)</h1>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa devotes this chapter almost entirely to the delineation of his vibhutis or divine manifestations. He is the best or the essence in all beings or things. The whole world has been supported by just a part of His glory.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 11 (<em>Viśvarūpa-darśana-yoga</em>, 55 verses)</h1>
			<p>At Arjuna&#x2019;s request whose curiosity has been roused, Śrī Kṛṣṇa reveals his Viśvarūpa or celestial form, after endowing him with a divine sight. Awed by it, Arjuna offers his prayers and obeisance. Śrī Kṛṣṇa withdraws the Viśvarūpa and declares that it can be seen only by those who have intense devotion.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 12 (<em>Bhaktiyoga</em>, 20 verses)</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, Śrī Kṛṣṇa declares that even though contemplation on the Avyakta or the Unmanifest leads to the same result as devotion to him, the latter path is better. He advises Arjuna to cultivate devotion to him. Towards the end, the characteristics of a bhakta or an ideal devotee are delineated.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 13 (<em>Kṣetra-kṣetrajña-yoga</em>, 34 verses)</h1>
			<p>The body is the kṣetra or the field. The Self is the kṣetrajña or the knower of the field. These two are described in this chapter. This is followed by descriptions of jñāna (knowledge), jñeya (that which is to be known, viz., Brahman), prakṛti (nature) and puruṣa (the Self or kṣetrajña). Those who can intuit the difference between the last two, will attain Brahman.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 14 (<em>Guṇatraya-vibhāga-yoga</em>, 27 verses)</h1>
			<p>Prakṛti or nature from which creation proceeds, prodded by the Lord (Śrī Kṛṣṇa), comprises the three guṇas—sattva, rajas and tamas. There is a detailed description of these guṇas and also that of the guṇātīta or the person who has transcen-ded them.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 15 (<em>Puruṣottama-yoga</em>, 20 verses)</h1>
			<p>In this chapter Śrī Kṛṣṇa describes saṁsāra or the created world as an inverted tree with its roots above, in Brahman or Purāṇa-puruṣa, the Primeval Being. By taking refuge in Him, this tree can be cut resulting in liberation. There is also a description of transmigration of the jīva, the bound soul. Śrī Kṛṣṇa also states that He is the power that sustains the world and the living beings. He is the Puruṣottama or the Best of beings.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 16 (<em>Daivāsura-sampad-vibhāga-yoga</em>, 24 verses)</h1>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa delineates here those traits of character (sampat) that make a person divine (daivī) or demoniac (āsurī). He assures Arjuna that he belongs to the divine group but urges him to avoid the three gateways to hell: lust, anger and greed.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 17 (<em>Śraddhātraya-vibhāga-yoga</em>, 28 verses)</h1>
			<p>This chapter contains interesting des-criptions of śraddhā (faith), āhāra (food), yajña (sacrifices), tapas (austerity) and dāna (gifts), all being divided into three categories according to the three guṇas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa also gives the aphorism &#x2018;Oṁ tat sat,&#x2019; a designation for Brahman, which can act as a magic formula to correct the deficiencies in religious acts.</p>
			<h1>Chapter 18 (<em>Mokṣa-saṁnyāsa-yoga</em>) 78 verses)</h1>
			<p>This is the last and the longest chapter dealing with several miscellaneous topics like tyāga and saṁnyāsa (renunci-ation), jñāna (knowledge), karma (action) and kartā (doer) classified as per the three guṇas. There is also the mention of the society being divided into four varṇas or groups, according to nature and vocation. Finally Śrī Kṛṣṇa advises Arjuna to totally surrender himself to Him, with the promise of freeing him from all sins. Arjuna, with his delusion destroyed by this wonderful discourse vows to fight in obedience to his command.</p>
			<h3>The Philosophy of the Bhagavadgītā</h3>
			<p>The Indian philosophical systems, known as darśanas, generally treat their subject under four major headings: the Cause of the universe; creation or evolution of the universe; nature of the individual soul; the goal of human life and the means of achieving it. Though the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> is not a systematic treatise on philosophy it is possible to deal with its subject matter under these headings. It may not be out of place to mention here that the colophon given at the end of each chapter of the <em>Gītā</em> viz., Upaniṣad, Brahmavidyā and Yogaśāstra, reflects its contents very well. It is an &#x2018;Upaniṣad&#x2019; or esoteric wisdom given by the teacher to a disciple on request. It is &#x2018;Brahmavidyā&#x2019; since it deals with Brahman, the Absolute. It is &#x2018;Yogaśāstra&#x2019; since it describes yoga or practical disciplines that help an aspirant to attain spiritual wisdom, the goal of life.</p>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa has been venerated and worshipped as God Himself, come down as a human being, to save mankind and re-direct it in the path of dharma or righteousness. In the <em>Mahābhārata</em> and the <em>Bhāgavata</em>, as also in the <em>Gītā</em> itself, Śrī Kṛṣṇa often identified himself with God and speaks with indisputable authority. While studying the philosophy of the <em>Gītā</em>, it is necessary to keep this fact in mind.</p>
			<p>The <em>Gītā</em> compares the created universe to an inverted tree with its roots above, established in God (15.1-4). The more popular view of the mythological lore that Brahmā (the four-faced Creator) creates the world during his &#x2018;day&#x2019; and withdraws it into himself during &#x2018;night,&#x2019; is also referred to (8.17-19). The various terms used to indicate the Supreme or God are: Parabrahman (13.12), Paramātman (13.22, 31), Uttamapuruṣa or Puruṣottama (15.17-19), Īśvara (15.17; 18.61), kṣetrajña (13.2) and Parameśvara (13.27).</p>
			<p>God has a twofold prakṛti or nature. The aparā or the lower one is insentient and comprises these eight: the five elements like earth and water, manas (mind), buddhi (intellect) and ahaṅkāra (egoism). The parā or the higher one consists of the innumerable jīvas or souls. Creation proceeds out of the combination of these two. It is under His direction that prakṛti gives birth to all beings and things. He is the sole origin and place of dissolution of this universe (7.4-6; 9.7). The whole universe is supported by Him even as the beads of a necklace are supported by the string on which they are strung (7.7). As Avyakta or the Unmanifest, He has pervaded the whole universe (9.4). That is why He is the essence of all, in this creation (10.41).</p>
			<p>God is not only transcendent and immanent (18.61), he can also incarnate himself as a human being, whenever dharma or righteousness declines, in order to restore its balance. He does it out of his own free will. By his māyā-power, and subjugating his prakṛti, he creates a body for himself (4.6-8).</p>
			<p>As incarnation, the personal aspect of the Impersonal, God is more easily approachable through devotion (9.26). He responds in whatever way people approach him (4.11; 7.21-23). His devotee never gets perished (9.31). Those who surrender to him will easily cross over māyā (the delusive power of God), which is otherwise impossible to cross (7.14). He takes over their entire responsibility even here in this world (9.22). That is why He constantly urges Arjuna to cultivate devotion to him and surrender to him (9.34; 11.55; 18.65, 66).</p>
			<p>The jīva or the individual soul is an important aspect of this creation. He is a part of God (15.7). He is the higher aspect of his nature, parāprakṛti (7.5). He is essentially unborn, indestructible and eternal (2.17-25). He takes on bodies like wearing garments and then discards them, to take new ones (2.22). While doing so he draws to himself the five sense-organs and the mind from the aparā prakṛti or the lower prakṛti (7.4, 5) and transmigrates with them. He is deluded by ajñāna or ignorance which covers jñāna or know-ledge (5.15).</p>
			<p>The goal of life is to reach the Lord&#x2019;s Abode from which there is no return to this mundane existence (8.16; 5.17; 15.6). This state has been variously called as brahma-nirvāṇa (dissolution into Brahman—2.72; 5.24), brāhmīsthiti (being established in Brahman—2.72), saṁsiddhi (perfection—8.15; 18.45), parāgati (highest state—6.45; 8.13, 21; 9.32; 13.28; 16.22) and attaining Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself (4.9, 10; 5.29; 7.3, 18, 23, 30; 8.5, 7, 14, 15, 16; 9.28, 34; 10.10; 11.55; 12.4, 9; 18.55). The ancient Upaniṣadic idea of the jīva reaching Brahmaloka (Abode of Brahmā) by the arcirādi-mārga or the path of light, has also been mentioned by the <em>Gītā</em> (8.24-26).</p>
			<p>Since it is ajñāna or ignorance that is responsible for transmigration, it can be erased only by jñāna or spiritual wisdom which alone can accomplish it (4.35-39; 5.16, 17).</p>
			<p>Acquisition of jñāna has to be preceded by spiritual disciplines that help in purifying the mind. Indriyanigraha or control of sense-organs is one of the most important disciplines referred to (2.58, 60, 61, 64, 68; 3.34, 41; 5.22, 23; 6.4, 24; 12.4). Tapas or austerity (16.1; 17.14-16; 18.5) and other disciplines including the performance of one&#x2019;s duties with the right attitude have also been recommended. But devotion to the Lord and surrendering to him have been highly extolled (7.21; 8.10, 22; 9.14, 26, 29, 31; 11.54; 12.17, 20; 13.10; 14.26; 18.55).</p>
			<p>There are three beautiful descriptions of the perfect being, who has reached the final goal of life: the sthitaprajña or the man of steady wisdom (2.55-72), the bhakta or the devotee (12.13-20) and the guṇātīta or one who has transcended the three guṇas (14.22-27).</p>
			<p>The sthitaprajña (man of steady wisdom) is bereft of all desires. He is unmoved by the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, attachment and aversion. He is capable of withdrawing his sense-organs from the sense-objects effortlessly. He is the supreme master of himself. He can wield his sense-organs among the sense-objects without being affected by them. He is ever awake to the ātman, the reality within himself. He is free from egoism and possessiveness, and hence ever filled with peace. This state is called brāhmīsthiti; the state of being established in Brahman.</p>
			<p>The bhakta or the ideal devotee who is ever dear to God, is free from inimical thoughts towards all beings. He has nothing but friendliness and compassion for them. He has neither egoism nor attachment. He is ever equanimous and contented. Having controlled the senses and the mind, he has totally dedicated them to God, out of devotion. He is never upset by the people nor are they agitated by him. Bereft of desires, pure to the core and expert in the field of work, he has yet renounced all selfish works. Deeply devo-ted to God, indifferent to praise and blame, unaffected by the vagaries of the weather and having no fixed place for dwelling, the bhakta is extremely dear to the Lord.</p>
			<p>The guṇātīta (who is beyond the three guṇas) is ever unaffected by the experiences brought about by the three guṇas, like knowledge or happiness or delusion. He knows that the guṇas as the senses act upon the guṇas as objects and that he as the Self is beyond them. He looks upon happiness and misery, wealth and worthless objects, praise and blame with equipoise. He never undertakes desire-motivated actions, but ever serves God through devotion.</p>
			<h3>Special Contribution of the Gītā to Indian Philosophical Thought</h3>
			<p>Though the <em>Gītā</em> has been reputed to contain the essence of the teachings of the Upaniṣads and is considered to be one of the three basic scriptures of Vedānta (prasthānatraya) there is no gainsaying the fact that it has charted new avenues in the Indian philosophical literature, previously unknown or unexpressed. The work presents us with three original doctrines: a. The doctrine of niṣkāma-karma-yoga (or the yoga of desireless action), with the allied concepts of svadharma and loka-saṅgraha; b. The doctrine of integral yoga as a comprehensive mode of sādhanā (or spiritual discipline); and c. The doctrine of avatāra (descent of God into the human form or the theory of incarnation of God.)</p>
			<h2>a. The Doctrine of Niṣkāmakarmayoga:</h2>
			<p>At the time of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, two major streams of thought, resulting in two different views and ways of life existed. On one side was the philosophy of abhyudaya or worldly well-being with its inordinate emphasis on yajñas and yāgas, sacrificial rites and rituals, by which one could get everything in life, here and hereafter. Since this involved a lot of time, energy and money, and since the results were considered petty, the reaction came in the form of the doctrine of niśśreyasa or the highest good, put forward by the sages of the Upaniṣads, who advocated a life of renunciation of all actions except those needed for the bare sustenance of life, coupled with mendicancy and contem-plation on the ātman (the Self) within.</p>
			<p>By their very nature these two views and ways were restricted to the brāhmaṇa-kṣattriya combine, at least, to the more affluent and the more rigorous amongst them. As a result, the majority of the people were left in the lurch, though imbued with higher spiritual aspirations. It is here that Śrī Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s doctrine of niṣkāma-karma-yoga becomes relevant and extremely useful.</p>
			<p>Being a wise and sensible leader, Śrī Kṛṣṇa accepts the tradition of sacrifices as it existed then, but shows the way to transform it or even transcend it. Since Prajāpati (Father of beings) created the system of yajña or sacrifice as a link between human beings and gods, they are expected to prosper only by mutual help and cooperation (3.10, 11). But a yajña or sacrifice need not be only that done in a duly consecrated fire. Any act of an indi-vidual, involving the sacrifice of selfishness and done for the public good can also be a yajña (<em>vide</em> 4.25-30).</p>
			<p>After defining saṁnyāsa as the renunciation of all kāmya-karmas or desire-motivated actions, and tyāga as the abandonment of sarvakarmaphala or the fruits of all actions (18.21), Śrī Kṛṣṇa rules out the renunciation of actions like yajña (sacrificial rites), dāna (giving gifts) and tapas (austerity) since they purify the mind (18.5). Even they are to be performed without attachment and the desire for fruits, as a matter of duty. What really binds one is not work itself, but the selfish desire for its fruits (<em>vide</em> 9.20, 21). Since work is inevitable for an embodied being (3.5,8; 18.11) it is better to accept the fact gracefully and perform it with self-control (3.7), as a yajña or sacrifice (3.9) and giving up the desire for the fruits thereof (3.19; 12.11). One who performs actions thus is both a saṁnyāsi and a yogi (6.1). Alternatively, one can perform actions for the sake of God and offer the fruits thereof (3.19; 12.11). One who performs actions thus is both a saṁnyāsi and a yogi (6.1). Alternatively, one can perform actions for the sake of God and offer the fruits also to him (12.6,10, 11; 11.55; 5.10-12). It is necessary to perform actions even from the standpoint of lokasaṅgraha or guiding the people on the right path (3.20, 25) which is the bounden duty of the leaders of the society.</p>
			<p>Work done in the right spirit, thus, can also lead to mokṣa (liberation or perfection). It is in no way less effective than jñāna or knowledge. Many a great one in the past, like Janaka, attained perfection through the path of action alone (3.19, 20; 4.15, 23, 41; 5.5, 6, 12; 8.7; 9.27, 28; 12.12; 18.45, 46, 56). Not only that, such persons, including Śrī Kṛṣṇa himself, continued to live in the society and work, to set an example to the unenlightened ones, as to perfection in work, which also will lead to beatitude (3.21-26).</p>
			<p>Arjuna was a sincere seeker of spiritual wisdom. He was not interested in sakāma-karma or desire-motivated actions. However, he was not qualified to tread the path of jñāna or knowledge which entails renunciation of all actions. That is why Śrī Kṛṣṇa declares that Arjuna has the competence only to work; and not to renouncing it; but he should do so without reference to the fruits thereof (2.47).</p>
			<p>Closely associated with this, is the idea of &#x2018;svadharma&#x2019;, &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; or duties that are &#x2018;sva&#x2019; or one&#x2019;s own, accruing to one by one&#x2019;s nature and nurture, and, ordained by the scriptures. It goes without saying that &#x2018;svadharma&#x2019; must be &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; (righteousness) first. Such svadharma should never be abandoned. If performed, it brings in great good; if abandoned, sin (2.31-33). However imperfect it may appear, it is far better to die performing it than to do paradharma or someone else&#x2019;s dharma which is unsuitable (3.35). One who acts according to svadharma will never be tainted by its effects (18.47). There is no doubt that the performance of svadharma in the right spirit will lead to perfection (18.45, 46).</p>
			<h2>b. The Doctrine of Integral Yoga:</h2>
			<p>As already stated, the colophon of the <em>Gītā</em> calls it as a &#x2018;yogaśāstra.&#x2019; &#x2018;Yoga&#x2019; is a technical term which means union with God as also the spiritual discipline that leads to such union.</p>
			<p>Though yoga is one, taking into consideration the different types of human mind—the active, the philosophical, the emotional and the psychic—it has branched off into four paths: Karmayoga, the path of work for the active:, Jñāna-yoga, the path of knowledge, for the philo-sophical; Bhaktiyoga, the path of devotion, for the emotional; and, Rājayoga, the path of psychic control for the psychic. Each of these yogas opens upon the infinite horizon of Truth and effects union with God. The <em>Gītā</em> describes them all.</p>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa has used the word &#x2018;yoga&#x2019; in several senses. For instance, it is Karmayoga that is meant in 2.48, 50 and 6.2. However, in 6.12 and 15 it is Rājayoga that is indicated. In 5.8 the word &#x2018;yukta&#x2019; has been used to signify the jñānayogi. Again, it is the bhaktiyogi that is implied by the word &#x2018;nityayukta&#x2019; in 8.14.</p>
			<p>Keeping in mind the fact that Śrī Kṛṣṇa has taught all the four yogas to one and the same person, Arjuna, urging him to follow them, it can be safely concluded that the yoga of the <em>Gītā</em> is a comprehensive spiritual discipline integra-ting into itself all the four aspects. However, since Arjuna&#x2019;s svabhāva or nature was such that Karmayoga was better suited to him, Śrī Kṛṣṇa relentlessly urges him to fight (2.18; 3.30; 11.34).</p>
			<p>The inference is obvious: The <em>Gītā </em>urges an aspirant to practise a balanced combination of all the four yogas, keeping that yoga which suits one&#x2019;s nature better, as the main discipline and adding the others too in right proportion. Since no human being has only one of the four faculties mentioned earlier, but all the four, though in varying proportions, this deduction is reasonable.</p>
			<h2>c. The Doctrine of Avatāra:</h2>
			<p>The doctrine of avatāra or incarnation of God is another, original contribution of the <em>Gītā</em> to Indian philosophical and religious literature. The avatāra concept is perhaps suggested in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (3.53.8; 6.47.18) itself. Some of the avatāras mentioned in the purāṇas in the lists of daśāvatāras (ten incarnations of Viṣṇu) are met with in the <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> (1.8.1.-6; 1.2.5.1). However, it is only here in the <em>Gītā</em>, that the concept is more definite and clear.</p>
			<p>When Śrī Kṛṣṇa mentions that the yoga which he taught to Vivasvān (Sun-god) and transmitted by him to Manu was lost in course of time, Arjuna naturally questions him out of unbelief how a contemporary person like him could have taught a person who lived in hoary antiquity (4.1-4). It is then that Śrī Kṛṣṇa reveals the truth of both of them passing through many births. Whereas Arjuna underwent those births helplessly due to prārabdha karma (residual karma, responsible for rebirth) and did not know about them, Śrī Kṛṣṇa being the Supreme Lord himself, voluntarily and willingly accepted these births for a higher purpose.</p>
			<p>It is dharma or righteousness that is the principle regulating the smooth working of the created world. Since the created world is a product of the three guṇas—sattva, rajas and tamas—which are constantly in a state of flux, it is but natural that each one of them gets the upper hand periodically. Whenever sattva goes down and rajas or tamas comes up, dharma declines and adharma (evil) gets the upper hand. At such critical periods of human history, the Supreme Lord decides to incar-nate himself in a human frame to restore the balance. Though he is unborn, eternal and the Lord of all beings, he can and does &#x2018;come down&#x2019; (avatāra = coming down) by taking recourse to his māyā-power (also called prakṛti or nature) (4.6, 7). The primary purpose of the avatāra is dharma-saṁsthāpana or establishing dharma on a firm foundation. In the process, if need be, He will destroy or chastise the wicked and thereby protect the good (4.8).</p>
			<p>This descent of the Divine into the human frame can take place anywhere, anytime, the sole condition being the decline of dharma and the ascent of adharma (4.7) to the extent of rendering the good people absolutely helpless, and at the mercy of the evil ones.</p>
			<p>There is an added assurance given by Śrī Kṛṣṇa that one who is able to understand the significance of his birth and work as an avatāra, will attain liberation (4.9).</p>
			<p>Of course, in a number of places, he urges Arjuna to cultivate devotion to him, to meditate upon him and to work for him (9.34; 11.55; 18.65), the finale being the command to surrender totally to him, with the pledge to free him from all sins (18.66).</p>
			<h3>Commentaries</h3>
			<p>Being a part of the prasthānatraya and thus accorded a very high place in the religio-philosophical tradition of India, the <em>Gītā</em> has attracted the attention of several ancient and medieval teachers who have written commentaries and glosses on it in Sanskrit. In the Advaita Vedānta tradition Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) comes first. In fact, his is the earliest of the extant commentaries. Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137), Madhva (A. D. 1197-1276), Nimbārka (12th century A. D.) and Vallabha (A. D. 1473-1531) are the other great ācāryas or teachers who have written commentaries on the <em>Gītā</em>. Ānandagiri (A. D. 1200), Vedānta Deśika (A. D. 1268-1370) and Jayatīrtha (13th century A. D.) have written glosses on the commentaries of Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja and Madhva respec-tively. Mention may also be made of the commentaries of Śrīdhara (15th century A. D.), Madhusūdana (A. D. 1525-1632) and Rāghavendra (A. D. 1598-1671) who have made some original contributions to the Gītā literature.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> is one of the most translated religious classics of the world. The beauty and the sublimity of the work, its eternal relevance to the problems of human life and its universal approach that helps us view the whole creation as one, may have prompted the scholars to under-take the task of translating it as a labour of love.</p>
			<p>Though part of the great epic <em>Mahā-bhārata</em>, it can as well stand on its own as an independent work. Though taught on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra, urging Arjuna to fight, it has nothing to do with wars or battles or bloodshed, but only with the discharging of one&#x2019;s sacred duties of life, however unpleasant they may be. Though given by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna in the days of yore, its declarations like, &#x2018;Remember Me and fight!&#x2019; (8.7) can help and inspire anyone of us, beleaguered with serious problems of life, even now. Though recognizing multiplicity here, its principle of unity in diversity as signified by the Viśavarūpa or the Cosmic Form (11.9-13) and the underlying divinity as taught in 7.7, help us to cultivate a holistic approach to the universe of which ecological balance too is only a small aspect.</p>
			<p>If the <em>Mahābhārata</em> can claim to be an encyclopaedia of Hindu religion and culture, the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> can as well claim to be its quintessence.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Hindu way of life has been influenced, to a very large extent, by the dharmaśāstras. These dharmaśāstras, chronologically speaking, fall into three categories:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The dharmasūtras and the Manusmṛti (6th century B.C. to the beginning of the Christian era);</li>
				<li>The versified smṛtis (upto A.D. 800);</li>
				<li>The commentaries and nibandhas or digests (A.D. 800-1800).</li>
			 </ol>
			<p>One of the well-known nibandhas or digests is the <em>Bhagavanta-bhāskara</em> of Nīlakaṇṭha (17th century), a son of Śaṅkarabhaṭṭa, who was a profound scholar of Mīmāṁsā. Nīlakaṇṭha composed this encyclopaedic work of religious and civil law, in honour of his patron Bhagavantadeva, a Bundella chieftain of the Sengara clan that ruled at Bareha, near the confluence of the rivers Jumna (Yamunā) and Chambal.</p>
			<p>This work has been divided into 12 sections called &#x2018;mayūkhas&#x2019; (or &#x2018;rays&#x2019;), the topics dealt with being: saṁskāra (sacraments), ācāra (personal conduct), kāla (time), śrāddha (afterdeath ceremonies), nīti (ethics), vyavahāra (social behaviour), dāna (gifts), utsarga (dedication for public benefit), pratiṣṭhā (foundation of temples for public good), prāyaścitta (expiations for sins), śuddhi (purificatory rites) and śānti (propitiatory rites).</p>
			<p>The rules given in this work are considered as a great authority in certain parts of India even now.</p>

			<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
			<p>Rāma and Kṛṣṇa (the most prominent of the incarnations of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa), Śiva and Devī, form the four main pillars upon which the edifice of Hindu theism rests. The two epics, <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and <em>Mahābhārata</em>, as also the vast paurāṇika literature, form the basis for the various cults and sects that have woven the texture of the variegated Hindu fabric. Among the various purāṇas, however, it is the <em>Bhāgavata</em> that has earned a pre-eminent place for itself, not only for its philosophical content and devotional fervour but also for its exquisite literary beauty. Though basically a text of the Bhāgavata school preaching the Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa-Kṛṣṇa cult, it is remarkably catholic in its outlook and has successfully harmonized Advaita philosophy as also the Śaiva cults with its basic tenets. While a study of this work is definitely fascinating and highly rewarding, it has also been considered as a test of one&#x2019;s scholarship.</p>
			<h1>PURĀṆAS</h1>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> has been classed among the purāṇas. Hence a few words about them will not be out of place here. Since early Vedic literature like the <em>Atharvaveda, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, Gopatha Brāhmaṇa</em> and <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> mention the word purāṇa (in singular), it may be inferred that the purāṇa was a branch of Vedic learning. The earliest beginnings of the purāṇa literature have been traced to the Pāri-plava Ākhyānas or narrations, commemorating the genealogies of great kingly lines and allied subjects, recited during periods of intervals in sacrifices. In course of time, recitation of the purāṇa seems to have been relegated to the sūtas (members of a mixed caste) since it was not integral to the sacrifices. This bifurcation helped in the development of a number of purāṇas and upapurāṇas (minor purāṇas) under the leadership of eminent sūtas like Lomaharṣaṇa who was a disciple of Vyāsa. It is very likely that Vyāsa compiled the original <em>Purāṇa-saṁhitā</em> which was expanded and divided by Lomaharṣaṇa and his disciples, resulting in course of time, in eighteen purāṇas and eighteen upapurāṇas as extant now. In the light of this, it is understandable how Vyāsa has been taken to be the author of all these purāṇas and upapurāṇas.</p>
			<p>There has been a controversy whether the &#x2018;Bhāgavata&#x2019; included in the list of the eighteen purāṇas (also called sometimes, as mahāpurāṇas) is <em>Devībhāgavata</em> or this (Viṣṇu) <em>Bhāgavata</em>. Many scholars opine in favour of the latter.</p>
			<h1>DATE AND AUTHORSHIP</h1>
			<p>With several unknown or variable factors involved, fixing the dates of ancient Hindu scriptures, has always been a difficult exercise. The <em>Bhāgavata</em> is no exception to this. The internal evidence of the work, viz., Śuka teaching it to king Parīkṣit, takes the date to the beginning of the Kali-yuga, around 3000 B.C. This is the opinion of the orthodox groups. Another view, that poet Bopadeva (13th cent.) was the author, has been thoroughly discounted by several scholars. A few are of the conviction that the core of the purāṇa is very old. However, it was given the shape of a mahāpurāṇa in the early Christian era and further expanded by the Tamil saints of South India, contemporaneous with the Āḷvārs (5th-8th cent. A. D.) Thus, there has been a three-phase development of the text.</p>
			<p>Though tradition ascribes the authorship to the sage Vedavyāsa, who was the author of the core of the work, those responsible for the second and third phases of development have remained unknown.</p>
			<h1>SYNOPSIS OF THE CONTENTS</h1>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> as available today, has been divided into 12 skandhas or books, further divided into 335 adhyāyas or chapters, containing in all, a little more than 14,000 ślokas or verses. However, tradition has always put it at 18,000 verses.</p>
			<p>A brief synopsis of the contents may now be given here:</p>
			<h1><em>First Skandha</em> (19 chapters, 809 verses)</h1>
			<p>This skandha, though introductory in form, is the final section added to complete the narration of Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s story and glory. In this sense, it may perhaps be considered as a supplement to the tenth skandha. The famous line &#x2018;Kṛṣṇastu bhagavān svayam&#x2019; occurring here (3.28) also signifies the finale to the development of the Bhāgavata literature. It also describes how the <em>Bhāgavata</em> came to be written.</p>
			<p>After an introduction through the story of Śaunaka and other sages performing a Sattra-yāga (a long-drawn fire sacrifice), the book expatiates the glory of the Bhāgavata Dharma or the life of devotion to the Lord, which can be cultivated through the study of the <em>Bhāgavata</em> and the teachings of Kṛṣṇa who lives in it. This is followed by a narration of how the <em>Bhāgavata</em> came to be composed by Vyāsa, on the advice of the sage Nārada, to get peace of mind.</p>
			<p>The book covers the last part of the story of the Pāṇḍavas including the incident of king Parīkṣit being cursed by a sage, to die of snake-bite. When the king has resigned himself to his fate, the sage Śuka, the son of Vyāsa, arrives there and starts narrating the story of the <em>Bhāgavata</em> for his spiritual good.</p>
			<h1><em>Second Skandha</em> (10 chapters, 391 verses)</h1>
			<p>Smallest of the twelve skandhas, this book may probably be the nucleus of the original <em>Bhāgavata</em>.</p>
			<p>Meditation on the Virāṭpuruṣa or the Cosmic Divinity, the ascent of the soul of yogi to the Brahmaloka, a description of the devotion to the Lord, Śuka&#x2019;s prayer to the Supreme Lord, glory of Lord Nārāyaṇa and his incarnations as also a brief account of the cosmic theories and theological doctrines of <em>Bhāgavata</em> form the subject-matter of this skandha.</p>
			<p>The well-known <em>Catuśślokī-Bhāga-vata</em> forms an integral part of the ninth chapter of this book.</p>
			<h1><em>Third Skandha</em> (33 chapters, 1410 verses)</h1>
			<p>This consists of two long quotations by Śuka, of dialogues that took place bet-ween Uddhava and Vidura, and between Vidura and Maitreya. It is sometimes interspersed with hymns and remarks by Parīkṣit and Śuka.</p>
			<p>The story of mutual fighting among the Yādavas and their destruction, the ascension of Kṛṣṇa to his Abode, Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s message to Vidura through Uddhava, Vidura&#x2019;s seeking Self-knowledge from the sage Maitreya and the latter&#x2019;s teaching containing the philosophy of jñāna and bhakti (knowledge and devotion) as taught by Kapila to his mother Devahūti—are the other contents of this book.</p>
			<h1><em>Fourth Skandha</em> (31 chapters, 1431 verses)</h1>
			<p>This skandha deals mainly with the stories of the daughters of Svāyambhuva Manu (a progenitor of mankind) and their lineage.</p>
			<p>The story of destruction of Dakṣa&#x2019;s sacrifice due to the wrath of Rudra who had been antagonized by Dakṣa and the episode of the child devotee Dhruva who retires to the forest and performs auste-rities to gain the grace of Lord Viṣṇu are the main contents of this book.</p>
			<h1><em>Fifth Skandha</em> (26 chapters, 668 verses)</h1>
			<p>A considerable part of this skandha is in prose.</p>
			<p>A schematic description of Brahmāṇḍa or the universe and detailed description of the earth form an important part of this book. The purpose seems to be to help the devotee to meditate on the physical universe as the body of the Lord.</p>
			<p>This skandha also contains the stories of great devotee-kings like Priyavrata, Ṛṣabha, Bharata and others.</p>
			<p>There is also an interesting description of twenty eight kinds of narakas or purgatories.</p>
			<h1><em>Sixth Skandha</em> (19 chapters, 849 verses)</h1>
			<p>This skandha starts with the story of Ajāmila, a sinner who was saved by uttering the word &#x2018;Nārāyaṇa&#x2019; on his death-bed, thereby revealing the mysterious power inherent in the divine name.</p>
			<p>Another episode dealt with in detail is that of Vṛtrāsura, a fiend who fought with Indra, but was defeated and killed by him. Vṛtrāsura was a great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu. Actually he was a devotee king Citraketu born as a fiend due to a curse.</p>
			<h1><em>Seventh Skandha</em> (15 chapters, 750 verses)</h1>
			<p>Misbehaviour provoking the dis-pleasure of holy persons, results in downfall. On the other hand, pleasing them through devoted service can lead to spiritual evolution. This is the theme developed in this skandha.</p>
			<p>The examples given are those of Nārada, Jaya and Vijaya. Nārada had to be reborn as a servant boy of low birth.</p>
			<p>Jaya and Vijaya, attendants of Lord Viṣṇu at his abode Vaikuṇṭha, were reborn as the demons Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇya-kaśipu. The story of Hiraṇyakaśipu also contains a detailed account of his son Prahlāda, one of the greatest exemplars of divine love. Prahlāda survives all the attempts of his father to kill him, due to the protection afforded by the Lord Viṣṇu to whom he had totally surrendered himself. The discourses of Prahlāda on the cult of bhakti, known as the Bhāgavata-dharma are an important part of this skandha.</p>
			<p>There is also a nice description of varṇāśrama-dharmas, ideals of the social system according to castes and stages of life.</p>
			<h1><em>Eighth Skandha</em> (24 chapters, 931 verses)</h1>
			<p>This skandha contains three important incidents: the story of Gajendra, the elephant king; the churning of the ocean of milk and the obtaining of amṛta or nectar by the gods; the story of Mahābali, the king of the asuras being vanquished by Lord Viṣṇu as Vāmana (the Dwarf).</p>
			<p>This skandha also gives the details of the manvantaras or epochs of Manus (patriarchs endowed with divine powers).</p>
			<p>The last part of skandha deals with naimittika-pralaya (intermediary deluge) that occurs at the end of a day of Brahmā, the Creator and the Matsyāvatāra (Fish-incarnation).</p>
			<h1><em>Ninth Skandha</em> (24 chapters, 964 verses)</h1>
			<p>Dealing mainly with genealogies of the great kingly and priestly lines, this skandha also gives accounts of some eminent personalities from among them.</p>
			<p>First comes the story of the sage Cyavana, his marriage with Sukanyā (daughter of king Śaryāti), her devoted service to the old sage and the blessings of the twin gods Aśvins upon the couple.</p>
			<p>Then comes the story of king Ambarīṣa, a great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, how the sage Durvāsas wanted to harm him and how he was protected by the Sudarśana-cakra, the Discus of the Lord Viṣṇu.</p>
			<p>Another notable episode is that of the king Rantideva who had gifted away everything and was living a very austere life. Once, after a long period of religious fasting when he was about to take his food, he readily parted with it to feed hungry guests.</p>
			<p>The stories of the kings Yayāti, Duṣyanta and his wife Śakuntalā as also the story of the Pāṇḍavas are the other episodes that appear in this section.</p>
			<h1><em>Tenth Skandha</em> (90 chapters, 3946 verses)</h1>
			<p>This is the biggest book of the <em>Bhāgavata</em> and is generally divided into two parts: the Pūrvārdha (the first part) consisting of 49 chapters and 2005 verses; the Uttarārdha (the second part) comprising 31 chapters and 1941 verses. It deals with the story of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in great detail.</p>
			<p>The birth, childish pranks and exploits of Lord Kṛṣṇa during his childhood days, his play with the gopīs of Vṛndāvan, his journey to Mathurā along with his elder brother Balarāma, his killing of the tyrant Kaṁsa, the ruler of Mathurā, his education under the sage Sāndīpani, his marriages with several princesses, his innumerable conquests as also his helping the Pāṇḍavas in various ways have been dealt with in detail.</p>
			<h1><em>Eleventh Skandha </em>(31 chapters, 1366 verses):</h1>
			<p>The main topic of discourse in this skandha which is the concluding part of the Kṛṣṇa saga, is mokṣa or liberation from transmigratory existence. The teachings of the Navayogīs or the nine sages to Vasudeva containing the Bhāgavata-dharma and Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s long discourse to Uddhava, now well-known as the <em>Uddhavagītā</em>, are the main contents of this book. The <em>Uddhavagītā</em> deals mainly with spiritual values like holy association, supremacy of devotion and details of the four yogas or paths to enlightenment.</p>
			<p>The book ends with the mutual destruction of the Yādavas and the exit of Kṛṣṇa from this world.</p>
			<h1><em>Twelfth Skandha </em>(13 chapters, 566 verses)</h1>
			<p>This is practically the prologue to the whole work.</p>
			<p>The genealogy of kingly lines that ruled after Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s ascension, the importance of devotion to God in Kaliyuga and the last part of the story of Parīkṣit are the main contents of this book. A synopsis of the whole <em>Bhāgavata</em> and the ceremonial way of studying it have been added at the end.</p>
			<h1>KṚṢṆA</h1>
			<p>Sage Vyāsa composed the <em>Bhāgavata</em> solely to express his devotion to the Lord by describing his glory through the Kṛṣṇa incarnation. Hence no study of the book can be complete without touching upon Kṛṣṇa, the person and the personality, his doings and sayings.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> declares that Kṛṣṇa is God himself, &#x2018;kṛṣṇastu bhagavān svayam&#x2019; (1.3.28). Since God is perfect, Kṛṣṇa, his human manifestation, too is perfect. His physical form and beauty are highly bewitching. His speech is exceedingly sweet. His intellect and wisdom, shrewdness and farsightedness, are matchless. His strength and power, valour and heroism are simply awesome. But, he is not a tyrant, though tyrants quake on hearing his very name. His heart is as soft as the butter he loves to consume in liberal quantities. A friend of the lowly and the meek, compassion incarnate, he is the first to rush to protect those in distress. Destroyer of demons, conqueror of emperors, he makes and unmakes kings, himself never accepting a throne. Wealth and power come rolling to his feet unasked, but he is most detached towards them.</p>
			<p>Kṛṣṇa is as great a spiritual preceptor as he is a warrior. Lord of Yoga and goal of the yogīs, his teachings as given to the gopīs or Uddhava, reveal the rarest of insights, but are intensely practical.</p>
			<p>Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s dealings with the gopīs of Vṛndāvan are often cavilled at, without a careful scrutiny. The king Parīkṣit himself raises serious doubts about Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s (appa-rently) unwholesome doings. Śuka&#x2019;s reply which sets his doubts at rest, runs on these lines: Even the sages who have gone beyond the bonds of karma due to spiritual enlightenment got by meditating upon the feet of the Lord, are beyond the dos and don&#x2019;ts of dharma. Then what to speak of him who is born out of his free will to save mankind? Sometimes these great ones act, transgressing dharma, but with a higher purpose. In such cases their words, and <em>not</em> actions, should be emulated. For instance, Śiva drank the deadly poison hālāhala to save the worlds. We cannot do so. Agni or fire can consume anything that is cast into it. We cannot.</p>
			<p>In whichever way the devotees approached Kṛṣṇa, in the same way did he respond. He knew that the gopīs&#x2019;s love was tainted with sex-passion. Like an expert psychiatrist he responded to it, in order to draw it out from the subconscious levels and destroy it, himself remaining all the while unaffected (<em>vide</em> 10.33.26). That this technique worked, is shown by the fact of their realizing him as their very Self (10.47.53).</p>
			<p>Born in a prison, he liberates others from prisons and bondage. Brought up by the cowherds he is highly admired and respected even by great sages and mighty kings. Though subjected to all kinds of tyranny, he frees others from tyranny and fear. He is an ideal householder, an ideal man of renunciation, a hero of thousand battles who knows no defeat, the terror of despots and hypocrites, a master statesman, a consummate man of action, a friend of the lowly ones including the untouchables—he is all things to all persons and hence, &#x2018;Puruṣottama,&#x2019; the Best of Men.</p>
			<h1>PHILOSOPHY OF THE BHĀGAVATA</h1>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> is a gospel of divine life and love, and not a treatise of philosophy. It is based upon vijñāna, the direct experience of the Reality but includes jñāna (rational philosophy built on it) also.</p>
			<p>According to it, Brahman or Ātman is the only absolute Reality. The whole universe is only an expression in name and form of this Reality. Other terms used to indicate it are: Paramātman, Pratya-gātman, Puruṣottama, Akṣara, Turīya, Bhūman and so on, as in the Upaniṣads. But the <em>Bhāgavata</em> calls it also by such other names as Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, Nārāyaṇa, Hari and so on. It is however pure consciousness, beyond words and thought and free from all limitations.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> accepts four pramāṇas or valid sources of knowledge: pratyakṣa (direct perception), anumāna (inference), āptavākya (tradition of spiritual experience of saints) and śruti (Vedas). However, all these can only point to Brahman, but cannot give direct experience.</p>
			<p>The work describes Brahman as an impersonal Super-person, the creator, sustainer and final refuge of the world of matter and mind. He is present in every atom of the universe in all his glory. Māyā is the infinite power he wields. He takes whatever form his devotees desire to worship him in, continuing to remain formless too. The emphasis in the text is more on personal God with form, as more suited to love, devotion and worship. And, Kṛṣṇa is God himself; or, rather, God is Kṛṣṇa himself !</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Bhagavat&#x2019; is one of the central concepts of the text. The word &#x2018;Bhagavān&#x2019; frequently used both for the personal God and the Absolute, means the &#x2018;gracious Lord,&#x2019; &#x2018;the Adorable One&#x2019;. It is also used as a term of respect while referring to saints and holy men.</p>
			<p>Then comes the concept of &#x2018;avatāra,&#x2019; God come down (avatāraṇa = coming down) as a living being, in order to help mankind to rise to divine levels by restoring the spiritual equilibrium. The <em>Bhāgavata</em> refers to several avatāras, there being no uniformity in the number or sequence, which varies from ten to forty.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> also refers to the four &#x2018;Vyūhas&#x2019; or emanations from Lord Viṣṇu. They are sometimes classed under avatāras though considered as different from avatāras that arise as a response to certain cosmic situations. They are: Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa Pradyumna and Aniruddha. They are different aspects of manifestation of the six qualities known as &#x2018;bhaga&#x2019; (like jñāna or knowledge, bala or power, aiśvarya or lordship and so on). While vāsudeva has all the six qualities in full measure, the other three have two each in greater measure than the others.</p>
			<p>The Ṛgvedic concept of &#x2018;Puruṣa&#x2019; also can be seen here. He is the Cosmic Person manifesting himself objectively as the individual and the universe. He is also called &#x2018;Puruṣottama&#x2019; and Kṛṣṇa is Puruṣottama.</p>
			<p>Then comes māyā, the power of God. It has three guṇas or strands, sattva, rajas and tamas. The whole universe is a product of the permutation and combination of these three when their equilibrium is disturbed by the will of God, who himself remains inactive like a magnet, itself at rest, inducing movement in iron filings.</p>
			<p>The world process appears to the devotees of the Lord as only his &#x2018;līlā&#x2019; or sport. He takes pleasure in it, the redemption of the struggling souls being its main purpose.</p>
			<p>The most important aspect of the teachings of the <em>Bhāgavata</em> is the mode of sādhanā it prescribes for attaining perfection. Bhakti, love or devotion, has been given the pride of place, though jñāna (knowledge), yoga (contemplation) and karma (right activities) too find an important place in its scheme. Bhakti has been advocated as a more natural and hence an easier, path to perfection.</p>
			<p>Bhakti has two aspects. When undertaken as the preliminary discipline, it is called &#x2018;sādhanā-bhakti&#x2019; or &#x2018;vaidhī-bhakti.&#x2019; It is more of the nature of karma or activities like worship or chanting or singing the divine names or other rituals. This ripens into &#x2018;aikāntikī&#x2019; or &#x2018;ahaitukī&#x2019; or &#x2018;ātyantikī&#x2019; (intense, single-pointed) bhakti, wherein love flows unobstructed towards God even as a river flows into the ocean. It is also termed as &#x2018;nirguṇā bhakti.&#x2019; One who has attained to this state of intense devotion is called a &#x2018;mahābhāgavata&#x2019; (a great devotee of God) or &#x2018;bhāgavatottama&#x2019; (the best of devotees).</p>
			<p>The object of bhakti may be the personal God or an avatāra, or the whole universe. Of these, bhakti towards an avatāra is the easiest and the sweetest. This bhakti can take several forms depen-ding upon the relationship that the devotee cultivates towards the Deity: śānta (peaceful contemplation), dāsya (servitude), vātsalya (parental love), sakhya (friendship) and kānta or mādhurya (conjugal love).</p>
			<p>Sometimes, even hatred and fear of God have been included within the orbit of bhakti by the text, since the intense concentration brought about by them on God can purify and liberate them that do so.</p>
			<p>Since love naturally expresses itself as service of the loved ones, the <em>Bhāgavata</em> lays great stress on service of the Personal God or saints or even the beings of the world as God&#x2019;s manifestation. Service to the poor, the needy and the suffering is especially advocated.</p>
			<p>Another peculiar feature of the work is the special reverence it advises one to cultivate towards the mother-land. Bhāratavarṣa, named after the great rājarṣi (sagely king) Bharata, is not a mere geographical unit but the mother of civilization and, the very embodiment of moral and spiritual culture.</p>
			<p>There is a fairly detailed treatment of the subject of varṇāśrama-dharma (scheme of duties according to castes and stages of life) which is a vindication of man&#x2019;s right to grow to the heights of spiritual realization. Character and conduct, rather than birth, are recognized as the <em>sine qua non</em> of greatness. It is also stressed that devotion helps one to transcend the limitations. imposed by birth.</p>
			<p>Religious emotion leads to reverence which expresses itself as worship. The <em>Bhāgavata</em> deals with ritualistic worship also as a part of the practice of devotion. Worship of pratimās (icons) and pratīkas (symbols), the sun, holy rivers like the Gaṅgā and the Himālaya mountains are mentioned as aids to devotion. It is also stressed that the devotee should never pray to God for anything for himself since the omniscient God knows what is best for him.</p>
			<p>The highest goal of life is called mukti. It is a state of freedom from all bondage and getting back one&#x2019;s natural state of divinity or bliss. Bhakti and japa (repetition of God&#x2019;s name) are the most efficacious means of purifying the mind leading ultimately to mukti.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that the work considers bhakti as the fifth puruṣārtha or value of life, beyond the other four, including even mokṣa or liberation. Bhakti is not merely the purifying agency, a means for a higher end, as in the view of many monistic thinkers, but, as its highest, is the acme of life, transcending mukti.</p>
			<p>Though several varieties or aspects of mukti such a sārūpya (having a form similar to that of the Lord) or sālokya (living in the world of God, viz., Vaikuṇṭha) are described, <em>Bhāgavata</em> is more inclined towards parābhakti, the highest or the most intense love of God, as the goal of life, wherein a semblance of the duality between the devotee and the Deity is kept up.</p>
			<p>Following the usual traditions of the purāṇas, the <em>Bhāgavata</em> also deals with many concepts involving immense time-periods and almost boundless regions of space in its narrations about creation. They become intelligible and meaningful only when it is recognized that the purāṇas trace the origin of the universe to the Supreme Being and accept the cyclic theory of creation, preservation and withdrawal as against the linear theory held by the modern scientists. Thus, they deal with cosmic history and geography.</p>
			<h1>LITERARY GRACE</h1>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> is also a work of exceptional literary merit. It is as graceful as it is tough. Whether it is a description of nature (10.20) or of places like Mathurā and Dvārakā (10.41; 10.37) or depiction of the well-known navarasas (nine poetic sentiments—10.29; 10.60; 10.37; 10.8; 10.80, 81), <em>Bhāgavata</em> excels in every way. No wonder then, that the community of scholars have, for centuries, accepted it as a touchstone of their erudition.</p>
			<h1>TRADITIONAL COMMENTARIES</h1>
			<p>For this very reason, the <em>Bhāgavata</em> has attracted the attention of several scholars who have composed commentaries on it. As many as 44 commentaries are known to exist.</p>
			<p>By far, the <em>Bhāvārthadīpikā</em> of Śrīdharasvāmin (14th cent.) seems to be the most popular of these commentaries. Brevity and clarity, a rather difficult combination, are its chief characteristics. It has also steered clear of controversies. <em>Dīpinī</em> is sub-commentary on this work by Rādhāramaṇadāsa Gosvāmin. Since Śrīdhara was a monk of the Advaita school of Vedānta, the other two schools—Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita—did not want to lag behind. The <em>Bhāgavata-candrikā</em> of Vīrarāghavācarya and the <em>Padaratnāvalī</em> of Vijayadhavaja-tīrtha are the commenta-ries, respectively, of these two schools. The other well-known commentaries still holding their sway among the followers of the respective cults are: <em>Subodhinī</em> of Vallabhācārya (A. D. 1473-1531); <em>Siddhānta-pradīpa</em> of Nimbārkā-cārya (12th cent.); <em>Kramasandarbha</em> of Jīvagosvāmin (15th cent.) and <em>Sārārtha-darśinī</em> of Viśvanātha-cakravartin (17th cent.). Sanātana Gosvāmin (15th cent.) has chosen to comment only on the tenth skandha. This work, <em>Bṛhad-vaiṣṇava-toṣiṇī</em>, is highly venerated by the followers of the Caitanya school.</p>
			<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> is essentially a devotional text. Much of the metaphysics found in it is theological in nature, supporting the devotional doctrines. The metaphysics, however, is that of Vedānta. Hence, the ideas stated in the Upaniṣads are often found here, sometimes using the very words or expressions. Though the work leans heavily towards advaita, the supre-macy of the Personal God, especially as Nārāyaṇa or Mahāviṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa, is always upheld; so also bhakti or devotion to him as the best means of achieving anything in life.</p>
			<p>However, the bhakti advocated here is not sentimentalism. It is upāsanā or meditation brought about by vairāgya (renunciation) and jñāna (knowledge of the Reality). Even sentimental devotion can help since it is directed towards the Lord, who knows how to react, correct, lead and guide his devotees.</p>
			<p>Attempts have also been made in the work to reconcile the Śiva and the Viṣṇu cults, at loggerheads with each other at that time.</p>
			<p>Synthesis of the paths of jñāna, bhakti and karma is another feature noticed here.</p>
			<p>But the greatest achievement of the <em>Bhāgavata</em> is the projection of the Kṛṣṇa saga and the Kṛṣṇa personality in the most poetical, and yet, powerful and graceful language. If Kṛṣṇa remains as the darling of millions of Hindu hearts even today, it is not a little due to this matchless work.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;The Bhāgavata Religion&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bhakti or love of God is a very ancient religious sentiment. Its origin can be traced even to the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (1.156.3; 8.98.11). It appears like a flash of lightning in the Upaniṣads (<em>vide</em> <em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> 2.23; <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em> 6.23). By the time of the epics and the purāṇas it has grown to voluminous proportions.</p>
			<p>Gradually bhakti was developed into a doctrine or a religion or even a philosophy. This has been christened as &#x2018;Bhāgavata-dharma.&#x2019; The term &#x2018;Bhāgavata-dharma&#x2019; has been derived from the word &#x2018;Bhagavat&#x2019; or God, endowed with &#x2018;bhaga&#x2019; or the six divine attributes of aiśvarya (lordship), dharma (righteousness), yaśas (celebrity), śrī (wealth and splendour), jñāna (knowledge) and vairāgya (detachment). Since this God is identified with Nārāyaṇa, this religion is also called &#x2018;Nārāyaṇīya-dharma.&#x2019; It was also called &#x2018;Sātvata-mata&#x2019; since it was current among the people of the &#x2018;satvat&#x2019; tribe to which Kṛṣṇa belonged. As it teaches ekānta-bhakti or single-minded devotion, it has come to be known as &#x2018;Ekāntika or Aikāntika mata.&#x2019; Other names of this system are: Pāñcarātra mata (religion as taught in the <em>Pāñcarātra Āgamas</em>) and Vaiṣṇava-dharma (religion of the followers of Viṣṇu).</p>
			<p>The <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> section of the <em>Mahā-bhārata</em> (<em>Śāntiparva</em> ch. 334 onwards), <em>Viṣṇupurāṇa, Bhagavadgītā, Bhāgavata, Pāñcarātra Āgamas, Bhaktisūtras</em> of Śāṇḍilya and Nārada—these are the sources of the Bhāgavata-dharma.</p>
			<p>Not being satisfied with the impersonal Brahman of the Upaniṣads, the Bhāgavata religion has converted it into the Personal God. Īśvara, Mahāviṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa and Kṛṣṇa-Vāsudeva are some of the names most commonly used with respect of him. He cannot be apprehended by the senses nor by logic. Śrutis or scriptures, at best, point towards him. His grace is the supreme factor in realizing him. Ekānta-bhakti or single-minded devotion is the only mode by which his grace can be obtained and he can be apprehended. Though He is &#x2018;sarvatantra-svatantra&#x2019; or supremely independent, actually it is not so! He is always &#x2018;bhakta-parādhīna&#x2019; or subject to the will of the devotees! He is ever fond of those that are devoted to him and reveals himself to them. Prapatti or śaraṇāgati (complete resignation) is another means of attaining him.</p>
			<p>The Caturvyūha doctrine is another speciality of this Bhāgavata-dharma. The four vyūhas or emanations of the Lord Viṣṇu are: Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. They are different aspects of manifestation of the six qualities known as &#x2018;bhaga&#x2019; mentioned earlier. While Vāsudeva has all the six qualities in full measure, the other three have two each in greater measure than the others.</p>
			<p>Followers of the Bhāgavata-dharma are called &#x2018;bhāgavatas.&#x2019;</p>

			<p>The theistic systems of Hindu philo-sophy and the cults based on them use the general term &#x2018;Bhagavān&#x2019; to denote God since He possesses &#x2018;bhaga&#x2019; or the six blessed qualities of jñāna (knowledge), aiśvarya (lordship) and so on, in abundance. His power, conceived as His consort, is called &#x2018;Bhagavatī; same as Śakti or Devī.</p>
			<p>Though this word can apply to any goddess or female deity, it is almost invariably used to denote Pārvatī and her several aspects.</p>
			<p>In the heart of the town Chengannur (in the Alleppy district of Kerala State) is situated a well-known temple of a goddess known as Bhagavatī. According to the local legend, Śiva and Pārvatī presented themselves before the sage Agastya, at the time of their marriage and settled down there. While residing there, the Devī had her menses, thus forcing the couple to stay back till the periods were over and the purificatory bath gone through. Even today, the devotees believe that the goddess Bhagavatī—whose image is cast in pañcaloha or an alloy of five metals—has her periods. The cella is kept closed for three days during such periods. On the fourth day there is a bathing ritual, conducted in the nearby river Pampā.</p>
			<p>Stories abound about the sceptics who had derided this phenomenon, having incurred the wrath of the deity and come to grief.</p>
			<p>The temple, sprawling over a six-acre plot, is a massive structure. The image of the deity faces west. After the original icon was damaged by fire, it was replaced by a pañcaloha idol. It is a beautiful image, about 60 cms. in height and has two hands in the varada (boon-giving) and abhaya (granting protection) poses.</p>
			<p>There is also a shrine for Śiva and the liṅga is of the svayambhū (self-manifested) type. Subsidiary shrines dedicated to Gaṇeśa and Caṇḍeśa located inside the complex, and temples of Śāstā and Kṛṣṇa, a little away, are the other attractions. A giant peepul tree on the western side is said to be endowed with the miraculous power of curing those possessed by evil spirits.</p>
			<p>The original temple might have been built by the Cerman dynasty (9th to 12th cent.). It was renovated later, though this renovation has not been completed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;bhagīratha-prayatna&#x2019; often used in Indian literature for Herculean efforts in any field, owes its origin to the king Bhagīratha, the son of Dilīpa of the Ikṣvāku race, ruling in Ayodhyā for several generations.</p>
			<p>The Sāgaras, 60,000 sons of the Sagara, an ancestor of Bhagīratha, had been reduced to ashes by the wrath of the sage Kapila. The only way of their spiritual redemption was to bring the river Gaṅgā from the svargaloka or heaven, and make its waters flow over these ashes. Though successive kings tried to do it, they failed. Finally, it was Bhagīratha who succeeded in doing so.</p>
			<p>He performed very severe austerities to please Brahmā, the Creator, who appeared before him and advised him to solicit the help of Śiva who alone could arrest the torrential flow of the river Gaṅgā and slow her down. Bhagīratha did tapas or penance once again and appeased Śiva who agreed to do so. Then, at the behest of Brahmā and the request of the king Bhagīratha, Gaṅgā descended on to Śiva&#x2019;s jaṭā or matted hair, emerged as a stream, followed the king right up to the pātāla or the nether world and flowed over the ashes, thus redeeming the Sāgaras.</p>
			<p>Since Bhagīratha brought the river Gaṅgā down to this earth, it has come to be known as the &#x2018;Bhāgīrathī.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Some mythological works say that Bhagīratha was the son of Aṁśumān, the grandson of Sagara.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bhairava is regarded as one of the terrible aspects of Rudra-Śiva, associated with his fights against the asuras or demons. During his fight with Andhakā-sura, eight emanations came out of him, called Aṣṭa-bhairavas. They are: Vidyā-rāja, Kāmarāja, Nāgarāja, Svacchandarāja, Lambitarāja, Devarāja, Ugrarāja and Vighnarāja. Other lists give the names as: Mahābhairava, Saṁhārabhairava, Asitāṅgabhairava, Rurubhairava, Kāla-bhairava, Krodhabhairava, Tāmracūḍa (or Kapālabhairava) and Candracūḍa (or Rudra-bhairava).</p>
			<p>Bhairava is sometimes mentioned as one of the five leaders of Śiva&#x2019;s troops.</p>
			<p>The <em>Rudra-yāmala-tantra</em> provides a list of 64 bhairavas in 8 groups. The groups are distinguished by the colour of their bodies, their ornaments and weapons.</p>
			<p>Iconographical works generally des-cribe the Bhairava as of a dark or reddish complexion and having four arms in which he carries mace, lotus, spear and discus. The number of arms may be increased to eight and the other objects carried in the hands may include sword, axe, small drum (ḍamaru), bell, fire and so on. Other texts describe him as having a flabby belly, round yellow eyes, sidetusks and wide nostrils, and, wearing a garland of skulls. Snakes are his ornaments.

			<p>It is quite likely that the Bhairava was the deity of the people of the outcaste groups. In some parts of India he is the protecting deity of the farmers.</p>
			<p>Bhairava is also the deity of some obscure religious cults like the Nātha Cult and the Kāpālika Cult. The Kāpālikas are sometimes referred to as &#x2018;Bhairava-yogīs.&#x2019;</p>

			<p>One of the several aspects of the Devī or the Śakti (the Mother Goddess, Pārvatī) Bhairavī is the consort of Bhairava (a terrible aspect of Rudra-Śiva). Though sometimes she is identified with Cāmuṇḍā, she is depicted in several forms such as Tripurā-bhairavī, Kāmeśvarī, Annapūrṇā-bhairavī, and so on. She is also the fifth in the series known as &#x2018;Daśamahāvidyās.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>She is described as resplendently red in complexion, wears a silk garment as also a garland of skulls. Her crown is adorned with a crescent moon. She has four arms. She holds a book and a rosary in two hands, the other two exhibiting the abhaya and varada mudrās granting protection from fear and the boons asked for.</p>

			<p>Bhakti or devotion to God is considered to be one of the earliest and the most efficacious forms of spiritual disciplines. Bhajana, also called kīrtana, which generally takes the form of singing devotional hymns and songs, is a popular mode of propagating the cult of bhakti or devotion among the masses.</p>
			<p>These bhajans and kīrtanas may be set to classical tunes and sung by experts; or to simple popular tunes or even folk-tunes, so that the masses can easily follow. The latter is sometimes called &#x2018;nāmāvalī-bhajanas&#x2019;. Groups of singers of bhajanas, going round a village or a town or a temple is still a common sight, especially in rural India.</p>
			<p>Institutions known as &#x2018;bhajana-maṭhas&#x2019; have also come into existence, to organise congregational singing. Such singing, organised by the singers of different religious cults has resulted in different &#x2018;bhajana-paddhatis&#x2019; or traditions of bhajanas.</p>
			<p>Singing of <em>tevārams</em> and <em>praban-dhams</em> of the saints of Tamilnadu, the <em>dāsapadas</em> and <em>vacanas</em> of Karnataka, the <em>abhaṅgas</em> of Maharashtra, the Vaiṣṇava kīrtanas, the <em>baūl</em> songs and the <em>Kālī-kīrtanas</em> of Bengal, the <em>bargīts</em> of Śaṅkaradeva and his followers in Assam, the bhajanas of Mīrā, Tulasīdās, Kabīr, Sūradas and Nānak form the various bhajana-paddhatis or traditions of devotional songs.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Bhakti or devotion to God has been recognised as one of the easiest, but most efficacious, method of sādhanā or spiritual practice, ultimately leading to beatitude. One who cultivates such devotion is called a &#x2018;bhakta;&#x2019; and, the path of bhakti itself systematised as a spiritual discipline is named &#x2018;Bhaktiyoga&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>A bhakta or a devotee of God is expected to cultivate certain virtues such as viveka (discrimination regarding food), vimoka (freedom from desire), abhyāsa (regular practice of disciplines), kriyā (doing good to others), kalyāṇa (purity through truth, straightforwardness, compassion and non-violence), anavasāda (cheerfulness) and anuddharṣa (absence of hilarity).</p>
			<p>Other disciplines he is expected to follow are: viṣayatyāga (renunciation of objects of desire), saṅgatyāga (giving up mental attachment towards them), avyā-vṛtta-bhajana (constant and continuous thinking of the Lord), śravaṇa and manana (hearing about and singing the glories of God), mahatsaṅga (cultivation of holy company), totally abjuring dussaṅga or evil company, taking recourse to viviktasthāna or lonely and peaceful places conducive to the cultivation of bhakti, complete dependence on God, performance of duties, but dedicating their fruits to God and so on.</p>
			<p>The bhaktas can be divided into three groups depending upon the guṇa or the nature of their devotion. As is well-known, there are three guṇas—sattva rajas and tamas. The sāttvika bhakta practises disciplines of bhakti to purify himself and to please the Lord. The rājasa bhakta practises devotion to gain worldly benefits. The tāmasa bhakta practises his devotions to bring harm upon others, out of jealousy and enmity (<em>vide Bhāgavata</em> 3.29.7-10).</p>
			<p>The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (7.16) offers a different classification: ārta (one who is afflicted by serious problems, needing immediate succour), arthārthi (one desirous of worldly gains that cannot be easily obtained by human efforts), jijñāsu (the inquirer of Truth) and jñāni (the enlightened one). Each succeeding devotee is considered as superior to the preceding one.</p>
			<p>The bhaktas may also be classified into different groups, depending upon the type of bhakti they practise towards God. For instance, those who cultivate dāsya-bhakti (devotion of the servant towards his master, like Hanumān&#x2019;s towards Rāma) form one group. Those that practise sakhya-bhakti (an attitude of friendship, like Arjuna&#x2019;s or Uddhava&#x2019;s towards Kṛṣṇa) belong to another group. Others who practise vātsalyabhakti (maternal love towards the child, as Yaśodā&#x2019;s towards the child Kṛṣṇa) fall into another group. Still others like Āṇḍāḷ and Mīrā, who practised madhurabhakti or conjugal love towards the Lord, form another group.</p>
			<p>An ideal bhakta is one who has no hatred or enmity towards anyone. He is full of compassion and friendly feeling towards all. He is free from egoism and possessiveness. He is equanimous in plea-sure and pain, ever forgiving and ever contented. He has mastered his passions and dedicated his mind to God. He can never cause unrest in others nor can he be upset by others in anyway. He is beyond all dualities of the mundane life. He is therefore, extremely dear to the Lord (<em>vide Bhagavadgītā</em> 12.13-20).</p>

			<p>Gaṇapati or Gaṇeśa, the elephant-faced god of the Hindu pantheon is one of the most popular and widely worshipped deities. He has a very large variety of aspects and Bhakta-Vighneśvara, also called Bhakta-Gaṇapati, is one of them.</p>
			<p>Iconographical works describe him as shining like the autumnal moon. He has four hands in which he carries a coconut, a mango fruit, a lump of sugar and a cup of pāyasa (pudding). In some descriptions a plantain replaces the lump of sugar.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Bhakti or devotion or love of God is one of the most widely recognised religious sentiments in all the major religions of the world. In Hinduism, its origins can be traced even to the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself. Praise of God (1.156.3), hearing or recitation of his names as also surrender to him (1.156.2), filial affection towards God (8.98.11), that he seeks his devotees (6.47.17), that he is our dearest and nearest (10.82.3)—these are some of the aspects of bhakti found in it.</p>
			<p>Coming to the Upaniṣads, we see that though they are mainly devoted to jñāna or knowledge, the doctrine of grace which is an important aspect of the philosophy of devotion, is found in some statements like, &#x2018;Whom the Ātman chooses, by him is He obtained; to him, He reveals Himself&#x2019;. (<em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> 2.23) So also another: &#x2018;When he who is devoid of desire-motivated actions, through the grace of God, the Supporter, sees the Paramātman&#x2019;s glory, then does he become freed from sorrow&#x2019; (ibid 2.20). The <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em> actually uses the word &#x2018;bhakti&#x2019; and clearly states &#x2018;prapatti&#x2019; (self-surrender) also (6.23; 6.18).</p>
			<p>In the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, as also in the epics and the purāṅas, bhakti has been dealt with extensively. In the later literature, treatises specially devoted to delineating the doctrine of bhakti have also appeared, thus enriching the cult of devotion, like <em>Śāṇḍilya-bhakti-sūtras, Nārada-bhakti-sūtras, Nārada-pāñca-rātra, Bhakti-rasāyana, Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</em> and so on.</p>
			<p>The philosophy of bhakti, called &#x2018;Bhāgavatadarśana&#x2019; accepts God as Personal, though the transcendental aspect too is not taboo. That he can be apprehended neither by the senses nor by the intellect, but only by devotion to him and his grace, is another cardinal principle. That the path of bhakti is open to all without exception and that is much easier than the other well-known paths like jñāna (knowledge) or yoga (contemplation), is another doctrine often propagated.</p>
			<p>Bhakti has been defined as &#x2018;parama-prema&#x2019; (intense love) or &#x2018;parā-anurakti&#x2019; (extreme attachment) to God, thus excluding or transcending all other kinds of love. And, this is also &#x2018;parā-bhakti&#x2019; or supreme devotion, which comes as the fulfilment of the practice of devotion. All other practices of devotion that are preliminary, but ultimately lead to parā-bhakti, are called &#x2018;aparā-bhakti&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Categorisation of bhakti depends upon the standpoint adopted for the purpose. Division according to the guṇas, listing bhakti as sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa, is one method; according to the state of mind of the votary, as bhakti of the ārta (the afflicted), of the arthārthi (the one seeking worldly gains), of the jijñāsu (an inquirer of Truth) and of the jñāni (the enlightened one) is another method. A third method depends upon the attitude of the devotee towards God. For instance, śānta is the devotion of a serene votary, dāsya of a servant, sakhya of a friend, vātsalya of a parent and madhura of a consort.</p>
			<p>One who aspires after cultivating bhakti is expected to adopt certain moral and spiritual disciplines in life. Avoiding evil company and cultivating holy company, detachment towards worldly things, taking recourse to lonely places conducive to devotion, giving up evil actions and actions motivated by selfish desires, performing one&#x2019;s duties as an act of worship of God, practising fortitude and dependence upon God, are some of the disciplines recommended.</p>
			<p>The actual act of devotion itself can take several forms such as listening to and singing the glories of God, ritualistic worship, repetition of the divine names and contemplation on the divine forms of God, dedicating the fruits of action to God and an attitude of utter surrender.</p>
			<p>Scriptures of bhakti do not prohibit a person from living an active life in the world. They only advise him to couple God with it. As regards the sins of omission and commission, a sincere repentance and prayer, and the consequent descent of God&#x2019;s grace, will efface them.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu scriptural works posit mokṣa or liberation from transmigratory existence, as the final goal of life. This can be achieved either through jñāna (know-ledge) or through bhakti (devotion). The well-known path of bhakti or devotion that ultimately leads to yoga or union with, or, being firmly rooted in, God is termed &#x2018;Bhaktiyoga&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>God has been described in the Upaniṣads both as the transcendent and as the immanent Spirit (Brahman-Ātman), as also a Person with infinite blessed qualities (Aupaniṣada-Puruṣa or Īśvara). In Bhaktiyoga, the stress is almost entirely on the latter aspect, though the former is accepted.</p>
			<p>Dhyāna or meditation on the form of the deity and japa or repetition of the divine name are the chief disciplines of this yoga.</p>
			<p>Diverse forms of one and the same God, first articulated in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (1.64.46; 10.114.5), have received a much more detailed treatment in the purāṇas and allied literature, as a result of the growth of various cults. These have come in very handy for the votaries of the bhakti cult advocating Bhaktiyoga. Meditation on anyone of the forms of God that one cherishes—and this is called the &#x2018;Iṣṭadevatā&#x2019;—and repetition of the mantra or the divine name associated with it, has been a popular and effective mode of spiritual practice in Bhaktiyoga. However, as per the age-old tradition, this mantra has to be received from a qualified guru or spiritual preceptor in a ceremonial way, called &#x2018;dīkṣā&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>A person to be qualified as a guru has to be sinless, fairly well-versed in the concerned spiritual literature and deeply rooted in God. Anyone who wishes to be a disciple should have cultivated the elementary moral virtues like satya or truth and dama or self-control. He should approach the guru in all humility and do personal service also. He should receive the mantra with great śraddhā or faith and adhere strictly to the instructions given by him.</p>
			<p>Apart from japa or repetition of the divine name, other aspects of the practice of Bhaktiyoga are: śravaṇa (listening to the stories of God), kīrtana (singing devotional hymns and songs), arcana (ritualistic worship), vandana (obeisance), culti-vation of anyone of the well-known attitudes like dāsya, sakhya or vātsalya and so on.</p>
			<p>The saints, sages and seers who have attained perfection by following the path of bhakti or devotion, are legion. Their characteristics like universal love and compassion, absolute selfcontrol, unselfishness to the core, equanimity under all vicissitudes of life are common to all the perfected beings who might have attained that state by other well-known means of sādhanā like jñāna or knowledge.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The philosophy of the Upaniṣads has been systematized in the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> (also called the <em>Vedāntasūtras</em>) attributed to Bādarāyaṇa. The Hindu tradition identi-fies him with the Vyāsa of the <em>Mahā-bhārata</em> fame.</p>
			<p>Of the several Sanskrit commentaries on it extant today, Śaṅkara&#x2019;s (A.D. 788-820) is the earliest. In the post-Śaṅkara period, several sub-commentaries were written on his <em>Brahmasūtra-bhāṣya</em>, necessitated by the need to further amplify certain subtle points of the Advaita philosophy or to counter the dialectical criticisms against the school. One of the most outstanding of these, is the <em>Bhāmatī</em> of Vācaspati Miśra (9th century A. D.) which created a new sub-school of Advaita Vedānta, known as the <em>Bhāmatī Prasthāna</em>.</p>
			<p>The story goes that Vācaspati Miśra named his celebrated gloss after his wife Bhāmatī who had served him devotedly, sacrificing all the conjugal pleasures, so that he could totally apply his mind to the creative literary work.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bhāmatī</em>, again, has six commentaries on it, the best-known among them being the <em>Kalpataru</em> of Amalānanda (13th century A. D.)</p>
			<p>The views of the Bhāmatī school can be briefly summarised as follows: Brahman is the material cause of this world, not as the locus of avidyā or nescience but as the object of avidyās supported by the jīvas or individual selves. Māyā is only an accessory cause. Avidyā cannot abide in Brahman. It abides in the jīvas and is plural. Vācaspati advocates two kinds of avidyās: the mūlāvidyā or kāraṇāvidyā (primal nescience) and the tūlāvidyā or kāryāvidyā (derivative nescience). It is the latter that is responsible for error impressions. Also, Vācaspati seems to be more inclined towards the &#x2018;avaccheda-vāda&#x2019; or the theory of limitation with regard to the appearance of the jīvas. Just as a pot limits the infinite sky in itself, avidyā of the individual limits Brahman and makes it appear like a jīva. Another point of importance of this work is that the mahāvākyas or great sentences (like <em>tat tvam asi</em>) do not produce anubhava or immediate experience. It is the mind seasoned by meditation that gives such experience.</p>

			<p>After Śiva reduced Manmatha (Cupid) to ashes, Citrakarma (an attendant of Śiva) gathered the ashes and shaped it into a human form. When Śiva opened his eyes after a long meditation, his eyes fell upon this image which immediately came to life. This person worshipped Śiva himself and secured several boons. He came to be known as Bhaṇḍāsura. Strengthened by these boons which conferred a long life and immense power as also immunity against several weapons, Bhaṇḍāsura started harassing Indra and other gods. Then Indra performed a sacrifice in honour of the Parāśakti or the Divine Mother. Pleased by it, she rose out of the sacrificial fire as Lalitā-Parameśvarī and killed Bhaṇḍāsura.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a technical term used by the Indian iconographical works. It may mean either &#x2018;bend or inclination&#x2019; or &#x2018;posture&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Images sculptured in the standing pose may have any one of the following four bhaṅgas:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>samabhaṅga (equally balanced): The image is poised firmly on both the legs. The right and left halves are identi-cal. The only exception is that the mudrās or poses of the hands may be different.</li>
				<li>ābhaṅga ( slightly bent): The upper half of the image is made to incline slightly to the right side.</li>
				<li>tribhaṅga (bent in three places): The head and the hips are disposed slightly to the right and left sides of the centre line.</li>
				<li>atibhaṅga (excessively bent): This is really an accentuated form of tribhaṅga.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In some iconographical works, the images are classified as sabhaṅga (with bhaṅga) and abhaṅga (without bhaṅga). Images standing with both legs firmly placed on the ground typify the latter. The former ones are divided into five varieties—the word &#x2018;bhaṅga&#x2019; being interpreted as &#x2018;posture&#x2019;—as follows: sthānaka (standing), āsīna (seated), śayāna (recumbent), yānaka (moving about) and nṛtta (dancing).</p>
			<p>The first three among these, are sometimes, again subdivided into yoga (in meditation), bhoga (in enjoyment), vīra (in heroic posture) and ābhicārika (black-magical).</p>

			<word>Bharadvāja</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bharadvāja (also Bhāradvāja) is the name of a sage that occurs often in the Hindu scriptures. The several Bharadvājas we come across there are obviously different persons. There is one Bharadvāja-Bārhaspatya who is the seer of several hymns of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (Maṇḍala 6). He is probably the same as Bharadvāja, son of Bṛhaspati and the father of the well-known Droṇācārya of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> mentions one Bhara-dvāja, a disciple of Vālmīki, who lived in Prayāga (Allahabad). It was at his instance that Rāma chose to stay at Citrakūṭa. While returning from Laṅkā, Rāma stayed back at his hermitage and sent the information of his coming, through Hanumān, to Bharata.</p>
			<p>Bharadvāja is sometimes counted among the seven sages known as &#x2018;gotra-pravartakas&#x2019; or the originators of the gotra (lineage). His descendants thus became Bhāradvājas.</p>
			<p>Two works attributed to a Bharadvāja are available now: <em>Bharadvāja Śrauta-sūtras</em> and <em>Bharadvāja Gṛhyasūtras</em>. The extant manuscript of the former consists of nine praśnas (sections) and part of the tenth. Passages from the latter have been quoted by other dharmaśāstra writers.</p>
			<p>The <em>Arthaśāstra</em> of Kauṭilya cites the views of a Bharadvāja seven times and of Kaṇiṅka Bharadvāja once. Not much is known of them or their works now.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Of the several Bharatas known to the Hindu mythological lore, first comes the emperor Bharata, the son of Ṛṣabha and Jayantī. The country that he ruled came to be known as &#x2018;Ajanābhavarṣa&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bharatavarṣa&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bhāratavarṣa&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The son of the king Duṣyanta and his queen Śakuntalā was also known as Bharata; and sometimes, as Sarvadamana.</p>
			<p>The Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas were his descendants. Some scholars opine that this country got its name &#x2018;Bharatavarṣa&#x2019; from him.</p>
			<p>Of all the Bharatas known to the Hindus, Bharata of the Rāmāyaṇa, the younger brother of Rāma, is the most popular. The second son of Daśaratha born in the womb of Kaikeyī he was deeply devoted to Rāma. When Kaikeyī forced Daśaratha, on the pretext of unfulfilled boons given earlier, to banish Rāma for 14 years and got the kingdom for Bharata, he refused to accept it. After chastising his mother, he went to the Citrakūṭa mountain where Rāma had just settled down, to persuade him to return. Since Rāma was firm, that obeying the commands of their father Daśaratha was binding upon both of them, and advised Bharata to rule the kingdom during the period of his banishment, Bharata returned to Ayodhyā with a heavy heart. He established the pādukās or wooden sandals of Rāma on the throne at Ayodhyā and ruled the kingdom on his behalf from Nandigrāma, a nearby village. He lived like an ascetic till Rāma returned and then handed back the kingdom to him. During his rule he had considerably improved it. (See also <ref>RĀMĀYAṆA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>Bharata has remained as the model of brotherly love, affection and loyalty for the Hindus over the centuries.</p>
			<p><em>Nāṭyaśāstra</em>, an original treatise on dramaturgy, is ascribed to one Bharata who is almost a legendary figure for us now. He might have lived during the period 200 B.C.—A.D. 400. His work as extant today does not seem to be the original. According to Abhinavagupta (A. D. 980) the most authoritative commentator on the <em>Nāṭyaśāstra</em> of Bharata, this work was in 36 chapters comprising 6000 ślokas or verses (<em>vide Abhinava-bhāratī</em>). (See <ref>ALAṄKĀRA-ŚASTRA</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>The <em>Ṛgveda</em> (3rd and 4th maṇḍalas) mentions Bharatas as a clan of people.</p>

			<p>The <em>Mahābhārata</em> is one of the two epics of Hinduism. It has been acclaimed as a veritable encyclopaedia of dharma or righteousness.</p>
			<p>Almost at the very end of this great epic, Vyāsa, its celebrated author, declares in great anguish that though dharma is the basis of all wealth and pleasures of life, though he is crying hoarse with both his hands uplifted, none seems to be interested in following it in life! He exhorts people not to abandon dharma even at the cost of one&#x2019;s life, let alone out of lust or fear or greed.</p>

			<p>Ancient and medieval Hindu scriptures often refer to India as &#x2018;Bhāratavarṣa,&#x2019; &#x2018;Bharatakhaṇḍa,&#x2019; &#x2018;Jambū-dvīpa&#x2019; and so on. Generally, the country to the south of the Himālayas and to the north of the Indian ocean is described as &#x2018;Bhāratavarṣa,&#x2019; practically the same as modern India or undivided India.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, Jambūdvīpa is described as comprising nine countries, out of which Bhāratavarṣa is one. The name &#x2018;Bhārata-varṣa&#x2019; might have been derived from the names of its rulers like Manu (who was also called Bharata) or Bharata, the son of Ṛṣabhadeva or Bharata-Sarvadamana, the son of Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā.</p>
			<p>Well-known mountains like Himavat, Mahendra and Malaya, and rivers like Sarasvatī, Gaṅgā, Yamunā and Gomatī belong to this Bhāratavarṣa.</p>
			<p>Even in the early works it has been admitted that dharma was fully developed in the Bhāratavarṣa and that the people were highly cultured.</p>

			<p>The <em>Ṛgveda</em> (1.142.9) mentions Bhāratī as one of the three goddesses (the other two being Iḷā and Sarasvatī) who are requested to reside in the barhis or sacrificial grass.</p>
			<p>In the later literature, Bhāratī has been identified with Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning. (See <ref>SARASVATĪ</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>According to some religious texts, Bhāratī is one of the two consorts of Gaṇapati, the other being Śrī.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Bhāratī&#x2019; is also one of the ten titles assigned to the monks of the Daśanāmī Order created by Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Dedicated to spreading Hindu edu-cational and cultural values, the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan was founded in A. D. 1938 (at Bombay, now Mumbai) by K. M. Munshi (A. D. 1887-1971), one of the prominent leaders of the freedom movement in India.</p>
			<p>True to its goal of revitalizing dharma or the Moral Law, in its threefold form of Satyam (Truth), Śivam (Auspiciousness) and Sundaram (Beauty), the organisation is striving to carry forward India&#x2019;s ageless message of Śraddhā (Faith), Saṁyama (Self-discipline) and Samarpaṇa (Dedication).</p>
			<p>The activities of this Institution are spread over various fields such as education, literature, morality, art and culture as also spiritual values.</p>
			<p>It has scrupulously kept itself away from the political field.</p>
			<p>Over the last seven decades it has established 121 centres all over India and abroad, with 315 constituent institutions. So far it has published 1700 titles of books with sales crossing 26 millions.</p>
			<p>Its most valuable publication has been the book, <em>The History and Culture of the Indian People</em>, in eleven volumes.</p>
			<p>Through its various institutions it is imparting education in subjects like Sanskrit, Indology, Indian Culture including music, dance and painting, as also yoga, ancient scriptures and languages.</p>

			<word>Bhartṛhari</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bhartṛhari is a well-known name in the classical Sanskrit literature. However, we come across two of them.</p>
			<p>The first was a grammarian who lived probably in the 5th century A. D. He has been classed among the famous trinity of grammarians—the other two being Pāṇini (400 B. C.) and Nāgeśa or Nāgoji Bhaṭṭa (18th cent. A. D.)—who developed the Sphoṭavāda, the theory that the meaning of a word or a sentence reveals itself in a flash as soon as its utterance is completed. (See <ref>SPHOṬAVĀDA</ref>.) He is said to have been a Buddhist. <em>Mahābhāṣya-dīpikā</em> and <em>Vākyapadīya</em> are the two works attributed to him. The former is a commentary on the <em>Mahābhāṣya</em> of Patañjali on the sūtras of Pāṇini. The latter is a grammatico-philosophical work in three kāṇḍas or sections dealing with Brahman, the Supreme, as Śabda or Logos.</p>
			<p>The second Bhartṛhari, whose period has been placed somewhere between 100 B. C. and A. D. 500, was the author of the three well-known Śatakas (one hundred verses) viz., the <em>Śṛṅgāraśataka</em>, the <em>Nīti-śataka</em> and the <em>Vairāgyaśataka</em>. The first deals with erotics, the second with general ethics and the last with renunciation.</p>
			<p>Though very little is known of him, tradition describes him as a king ruling in Ujjayinī who later abdicated his throne in favour of his younger brother Vikramā-ditya, the originator of the Saṁvat era, since he was disgusted with the infidelity of his queen.</p>

			<word>Bhartṛprapañca</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Vedānta system is the most well-known of the six systems of Indian philosophy. It is commanding great respect among the intellectuals even now. Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820), Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) and Madhva (A. D. 1197-1276) were the pioneers in the three schools of Vedānta, viz., advaita, viśiṣṭādvaita and dvaita, which are popular even today. However, there are other—though less-known—schools of Vedānta, the propagators of some of which preceded even Śaṅkara. Bhartṛprapañca was one such. Practically nothing is known of him except that he taught &#x2018;bhedābheda-vāda,&#x2019; the doctrine of &#x2018;identity in difference&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>This doctrine is a kind of monism in which both bheda or difference and abheda or identity are accepted between Brahman on the one hand and the jīvas, as also the world, on the other. The waves and the foam or the bubbles that arise in the ocean are all identical as water, but different as waves or bubbles. Similarly, the jīvas or the individual souls and the world, which evolve out of Brahman are both different and non-different from it.</p>
			<p>Bhartṛprapañca accepts pramāṇa-samuccaya, a combination of all the three well-known means of knowledge—pratyakṣa or direct perception, anumāna or inference and āgama or the Vedas. As a consequence, he accepts the reality of the world experienced through the sense-organs and hence the need for karma or action including ritualistic actions. This leads us to his next proposition of jñāna-karma-samuccaya, a combination of know-ledge and action, as a means to mokṣa or liberation. Karma or desireless action leads to apavarga or freedom from saṁsāra (transmigration) and jñāna leads to the destruction of avidyā or ignorance, ultimately resulting in identity with Brahman, the ultimate Truth.</p>

			<word>Bhāsa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bhāsa is one of the reputed authors known to the writers of ancient classical literature in Sanskrit. Though mentioned by Kālidāsa and Bāṇa, his works had not been traced. It was only in 1912 that Paṇḍit Gaṇapati Śāstri of Trivandrum published 13 plays like <em>Pratijña Yaugandarāyaṇa</em> and <em>Svapnavāsavadatta</em>. After several rounds of controversies among the Sanskrit scholars, it is now generally agreed that all these 13 plays are by a single author and that it could be Bhāsa, though the evidence is not conclusive. He might have been a contemporary of Pāṇini, the grammarian, and might have lived in the 4th century B. C., but in a place far away from his.</p>
			<p>Very little is known of his life. He was probably a brāhmaṇa-muni and had strong leanings towards the Viṣṇu cult.</p>
			<p>Six of his plays like <em>Madhyama Vyāyoga</em>, <em>Karṇabhāra</em> and <em>Ūrubhaṅga</em> are based on the <em>Mahābhārata </em> and two (<em>Pratimā</em> and <em>Abhiṣeka</em>) on the Rāmāyaṇa.</p>
			<p>The rest like <em>Svapnavāsavadatta</em> and <em>Avimāraka</em> are from miscellaneous sources like the <em>Bṛhatkathā</em> of Guṇāḍhya, an ancient collection of tales in the Paiśācī language.</p>
			<p>Bhāsa&#x2019;s language is simple, direct and forceful. The dramas are eminently suited to be enacted on the stage.</p>

			<p>This is a well-known and popular treatise on the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philo-sophy by Viśvanātha Nyāyapañcānana Bhaṭṭācārya (17th Century A. D.) who lived in Navadvīpa (in Bengal).</p>
			<p>The author himself has written a detailed commentary, <em>Siddhāntamuktāvalī</em> by name.</p>
			<p>There are 168 verses in the anuṣṭubh metre.</p>
			<p>The work, which is quite a tough one, deals with the following topics: the seven categories (saptapadārthas); the substances (dravyas); the five methods of knowledge like pratyakṣa or direct perception; mind; qualities (guṇas); some details about inference (anumāna); some miscellaneous qualities.</p>

			<word>Bhāskara</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Vedānta system of philosophy based mainly on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, which itself is a systematization of the doctrines of the major Upaniṣads, gained greater currency and respectability due to Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820). Out of the several post-Śaṅkara Vedāntins, who criticised his views, Bhāskara was one. Since Rāmānuja (A.D. 1017-1137) in turn criticises the views of Bhāskara, the latter may have lived prior to him, around A.D. 900.</p>
			<p>Bhāskara wrote a commentary on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, the <em>Bhāskara-bhāṣya</em>, wherein he has expressed his views. His school is generally called the <em>Bhedā-bhedavāda</em>, a doctrine that upholds the reality of both unity and multiplicity.</p>
			<p>This world of souls and matter is a real evolution of Brahman. Brahman is not an undifferentiated mass of consciousness. In the causal state, it is a unity and in the evolved state it is a multiplicity. In its causal and generic aspect, this world is non-different from Brahman, but different as effects and individuals. Both are equally real.</p>
			<p>Matter as evolved into bodies and senses acts on Brahman as an upādhi or limiting adjunct and results in the rise of the jīvas or individual souls. However, the jīvas are related to Brahman as sparks to fire and are atomic in size. The life of saṁsāra or bondage brought about by transmigration is due to the confusing between Brahman and the upādhis. Libe-ration comes through karma or actions prescribed by the Vedas, done in the right spirit, and jñāna or knowledge of the soul that arises in the mind purified by karma. Thus he advocates jñāna-karma-samuccaya or a balanced combination of action and knowledge.</p>
			<p>There was another Bhāskara, who probably lived in the 7th century A. D. He was the author of two works on astronomy—<em>Mahābhāskarīya</em> and <em>Laghu-bhāskarīya—</em>which were used for astronomical calculations in South India upto the end of the 15th century.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A celebrated astronomer and mathematician, Bhāskarācārya (A. D. 1114-1160) wrote the monumental work <em>Siddhānta-śiromaṇi</em> when he was only 36. It has four chapters of which the first—called <em>Līlāvatī—</em>is on arithmetic. The story goes that he named this part of his work after his daughter Līlāvatī who was widowed at an early age, to immortalize her. An extremely popular work written in an interesting and entertaining manner, it has been translated into several languages over the centuries. It includes sections on śūnya or zero, geometry, mensuration, and kuṭṭaka or indeterminate equations of the first magnitude. <em>Bījagaṇita</em> or algebra is the second chapter. The other two chapters called <em>Gaṇitādhyāya</em> and <em>Golādhyāya</em> are works on astronomy that include celestial mathematics.</p>
			<p>The work has several commentaries in Sanskrit.</p>
			<p>Another work of his, called <em>Kāraṇa-kutūhala</em>, a handbook for preparing astronomical tables, is not so well-known.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Worship of God as Mother is an ancient practice in India. Though the references to the Mother-cult are very meagre in the early Vedic literature, we have plenty of material in the later purāṇas and tantras. One of the most famous texts of the Mother-cult, which is very popular in South India is the <em>Lalitāsahasranāma</em>, which again is a part of the <em>Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa</em>. The most celebrated commentary on this text is the <em>Saubhāgyabhāskara</em> of Bhāskara-rāya-makhin (also known as Bhāsurānanda-nātha). He lived during the 17th-18th centuries. His spiritual preceptor was Narasiṁha Adhvarī who taught him 18 kinds of sciences. An adept in several fields like the Vedānta, Mīmāṁsā, vyākaraṇa (grammar) and mantraśāstra (science of mantras) he is said to have composed 42 works. The works <em>Varivasyā-rahasya</em> and <em>Setubandha</em> along with the <em>Saubhāgya-bhāskara</em> are considered as the &#x2018;prasthānatraya&#x2019; or the three basic texts of <em>Śrīvidyā</em>, the Mother-cult of South India.</p>

			<word>bhasma</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;that which shines,&#x2019; &#x2018;that which destroys all sins,&#x2019; &#x2018;that which produces auspiciousness,&#x2019; &#x2018;ashes&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Fire is believed to reduce all substances to their primal state of purity. Hence, bhasma or ashes have always been considered as sacred by certain sections of the Hindu society, especially the Śaivas and the Śāktas (followers of Śiva and Śakti or the Divine Mother).</p>
			<p>Bhasma derived from the Vedic fires is called &#x2018;Śrauta-bhasma.&#x2019; It is to be taken out of the fire when the Vedic ritual is in progress and applied on the body. That derived from the fire lit up during a ritual performed as per the directions of smṛtis (secondary scriptures like the dharma-śāstras) is called &#x2018;smārta-bhasma.&#x2019; If the fire is kindled by the Aghora-mantra (a mantra describing the aghora or non-fierce aspect of Śiva) with the wood of the bilva tree (<em>Aegle marmelos</em>), the ashes are called &#x2018;śivāgni-bhasma.&#x2019; This bhasma is considered to be extremely sacred and capable of destroying sins as also ritual impurities.</p>
			<p>Wearing a &#x2018;tripuṇḍra,&#x2019; a mark of three lines on the forehead with bhasma, using the fingers on the right hand (the thumb, the middle finger and the ring finger) is considered a must for all the devotees of Śiva. These three lines are supposed to represent: the three Vedas (<em>Ṛg, Yajus</em> and <em>Sāman</em>); the three syllables (<em>a, u</em> and <em>ma</em>) of Om; the three guṇas (sattva, rajas and tamas); the three śaktis or powers (kriyāśakti, icchāśakti and jñānaśakti) of Devī or Divine Mother; the three pressings of soma juice in Somayāga (prātassavana, mādhyandinasavana and tṛtīyasavana) and so on. The whole idea seems to be to bring into one&#x2019;s mind, various religio-spiritual concepts so as to feel pure and elevated.</p>
			<p>Bhasma may be smeared over other parts of the body also, often to the accompaniment of appropriate mantras, thus purifying both the body and the mind. This is sometimes called bhasma-snāna or bath with bhasma.</p>
			<p>Among the liṅgāyats (śaivites of Karnataka State) bhasma-dhāraṇa or applying the tripuṇḍra of bhasma on the forehead is considered as an important act of practice classed under &#x2018;aṣṭāvaraṇas.&#x2019; (See <ref>AṢṬĀVARAṆAS</ref>.) According to their philosophy, bhasma is really that which burns up all illusions and paves the way for the intuition of the inner Self. The ashes are only an external and gross symbol of the process.</p>
			<p>Bhasma as consecrated ash is used for ritual purification (like the water of the Gaṅgā river) of objects defiled by the touch of undesirable (or sinful) persons or animals etc., for protection against inauspicious things or evil spirits or even for purposes of sorcery and magical rites.</p>
			<p>Bhasma has to be prepared by burning cowdung cakes in fire with appropriate mantras. The process has been described in the <em>Bhasma-jābalopaniṣad</em>, one of the minor upaniṣads of the Śaiva cult.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the minor upaniṣads of the <em>Atharvaṇaveda</em> group, <em>Bhasmajābālopa-niṣad</em> is in the form of a long conversation between the sage Jābāla-Bhusuṇḍi and Lord Śiva. It is in prose and consists of two chapters.</p>
			<p>The sage Jābāla approaches Lord Śiva with great reverence and inquires of him thus:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Please teach me all about bhasma (holy ash) including the mode of wearing the tripuṇḍra (religious mark of three lines drawn on the forehead) by which mokṣa or liberation can be easily obtained.</li>
				<li>Kindly enlighten me about the daily duties of a brāhmaṇa in detail.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The reply given by the Lord Śiva may be summarised as follows:</p>
			<p>Before sunrise, fresh cowdung is to be collected on a palāśa leaf (<em>Butea frondos</em>), dried and then reduced to ashes in the gṛhya fire duly established, using materials like sesame or paddy soaked in ghee, which should be offered into the fire with appropriate mantras like <em>tryambakaṁ yajāmahe</em> and <em>somāya svāhā. </em>The ashes, after being consecrated through the Gāyatrī-mantra, should be collected in a pot made of gold or silver or even mud. Taking some of it in the palm of the left hand, it should be applied on all parts of the body like the head, forehead, ears, neck, arms, chest and navel, repeating the mantras prescribed for each of the application.</p>
			<p>In case the duly prepared bhasma is not available, the bhasma gathered from a cremation ground or any other place may be used after purifying it with appropriate mantras.</p>
			<p>Applying the bhasma as prescribed is a sacred and compulsory duty for a brāhmaṇa. If he fails to do so he incurs sin which has to be expiated by the repetition of the Gāyatrī-mantra, while standing in water and fasting. However, if he does it as prescribed, he will be freed from all sins, and obtains the fruits of pilgrimage to all the holy places as also a long life.</p>
			<p>As for the daily duties of a brāhmaṇa the Lord Śiva gives a detailed procedure for bath, putting on clean washed clothes, anointing with bhasma and wearing rudrākṣa beads.</p>
			<p>This is then followed by instructions for worshipping the Śivaliṅga (the emblem of Śiva). This has to be done thrice a day. Meditation on Lord Śiva&#x2019;s form, bathing the liṅga with water as also the bhasma and worship with the bilva (<em>Aegle marmelos</em>) leaves, are its constituents.</p>
			<p>Next, the Lord teaches the mantra of six letters (<em>Oṁ namaś śivāya</em>) and the mantra of eight letters (<em>Oṁ namo mahā-devāya</em>). These are called &#x2018;tārakamantras&#x2019; since they help the human being to cross (tāraka = that which helps one to cross) the ocean of saṁsāra or transmigration.</p>
			<p>Then comes a description of Śiva as Brahman, followed by the assertion that knowledge of Śiva-Rudra leads to mokṣa or liberation.</p>
			<p>Lord Śiva is the support of the whole creation. He is the one who liberates the living beings from bondage. Those who are unable to realize this, should go to Kāśī and live there till death. Such votaries of Śiva who live in Kāśī should never swerve from the path of truth and never miss smearing bhasma on their bodies, wearing rudrākṣa beads and worshipping Him through the liṅga, which is &#x2018;jyotirliṅga&#x2019; or &#x2018;liṅga of light&#x2019;. Such worship and meditation on him will confer results like freedom from sins, sorrows and sufferings. He will ultimately attain mukti or liberation. Failure to worship Lord Śiva at Kāśī thus, will entail sin which has to be expiated through bath, fasting and chanting of the <em>Rudra</em> (a section from the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>).</p>
			<p>Lord Śiva utters the tārakamantra (<em>Oṁ namaśśivāya</em>) into the ears of those dying at Kāśī, thus liberating them from saṁsāra or transmigration.</p>
			<p>The upaniṣad concludes with a warning to those that live at Kāśī, but transgress the prescribed mode of living. But they too will be liberated after suffering and repentance.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The words &#x2018;bhāva&#x2019; and &#x2018;rasa&#x2019; are often used in works dealing with dramatics and poetics. A bhāva is defined as a permanent or lasting emotion lying deep in the subconscious strata of our minds. When it is aesthetically excited, it produces, in a sympathetic heart, the corresponding sentiment called &#x2018;rasa.&#x2019; Bhāvas have been listed as nine with the corresponding rasas, also nine, known as &#x2018;navarasas&#x2019;. They are:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>BHĀVA</th>
					<th>RASA</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1. rati (lust)</td>
					<td>śṛṅgāra (erotic)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2. hāsa (mirth)</td>
					<td>hāsya (comic)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3. śoka (sorrow)</td>
					<td>karuṇā (pathetic)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4. krodha (anger)</td>
					<td>raudra (furious)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>5. utsāha (courage)</td>
					<td>vīra (heroic)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>6. bhaya (fear)</td>
					<td>bhayānaka (terrible)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>7. jugupsā (aversion)</td>
					<td>bībhatsa(disgusting)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>8. vismaya (wonder)</td>
					<td>adbhuta(marvellous)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>9. nirveda or śama (detachment, repose)</td>
					<td>śānta (peaceful)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>These bhāvas considered as permanent, are sometimes called &#x2018;sthāyī-bhāvas&#x2019; as against the transitory ones, called &#x2018;sañcārī or vyabhicārī bhāvas.&#x2019; The latter may be as many as 33 or 34.</p>
			<p>Eight more bhāvas or states, involuntary evidences of internal feelings like trembling, shedding tears and so on, are also mentioned sometimes, taking the total number to 50 or 51. (See also <ref>ALAṄKĀRA-ŚĀSTRA</ref> and <ref>RASAS</ref>.)</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;bhāva&#x2019; in Hindu astrology indicates the significance of a house in a horoscope. For instance, the &#x2018;bhāva&#x2019; of the second house is dhana or wealth, and of the fifth house it is putra or son. So, if the planets are propitiously situated with reference to the second or the fifth house, he would be wealthy or have sons.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In the classical Sanskrit literature, one of the playwrights who is often compared favourably with Kālidāsa—considered to be the greatest—is Bhava-bhūti. His original name was Śrīkaṇṭha. &#x2018;Bhavabhūti&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bhaṭṭabhavabhūti&#x2019; was the name by which he came to be known in the annals of Sanskrit literature. His parents were Jatukarṇi and Nīlakaṇṭha. Jñānanidhi was his teacher. He belonged to the Kāśyapa gotra or lineage. He must have lived in the early part of the 8th century A.D., in Padmapura of Vidarbha-deśa (near the modern Nagpur).</p>
			<p><em>Mālatīmādhava, Mahāvīracarita</em> and <em>Uttararāmacarita</em> are the three well-known nāṭakas or plays authored by him. The first is a love-story whereas the latter two are stories based on the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>. The author has taken quite a bit of freedom in altering the original story to suit his purpose. His style is rather tough though elegant. Books on dramaturgy and poetics often quote from his works as ideal examples for the particular points made out by them.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu scriptures have been classified into two groups: śruti and smṛti. The Vedas are the śruti, the revealed works. All other works—the works of the sages like Manu, Yājñavalkya and Parāśara—which deal with more mundane matters such as ācāra (personal conduct) and vyavahāra (social conduct) come under the second group. These works are also called &#x2018;dharma-śāstras.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstra literature has grown abundantly over the centuries, due to the contributions of numerous sages, scholars and religio-social leaders. Consi-dering the needs of the contemporary society these savants added or deleted or substituted or modified the several rules given in the earlier books.</p>
			<p>One such author was Bhavadeva-bhaṭṭa, who also had the honorific &#x2018;Bālavalabhī-bhujaṅga.&#x2019; He was the son of Govardhana and Sāṅgokā and belonged to the Sāvarṇa gotra or lineage of the Kauthumī school of <em>Sāmaveda</em>. The family belonged to the Siddhalagrāma in Rāhā (in Bengal). Baladevabhaṭṭa was a minister of the king Harivarmadeva. He must have lived around A. D. 1100.</p>
			<p>The works attributed to him are: <em>Vyavahāratilaka, Sambandhaviveka, Karmānuṣṭhānapaddhati, Prāyaścitta-prakaraṇa </em>and Tautātitamatatilaka.</p>
			<p>The first work, on judicial procedure, though quoted by some others, has not been traced till now. The second is a small work based on a part of <em>Manusmṛti</em> (3.5) dealing with the prohibition of endogamous marriages. The principal subjects dealt with in the third are: navagraha-homa (oblations into the duly consecrated fire to appease the nine planets), mātṛpūjā (worshipping the mother), pāṇigrahaṇa (clasping the hand) and other rites connected with marriage as also the other saṁskāras or sacraments like upanayana (initiation into Vedic studies). The fourth deals with the expiations for five grave sins like brahmahatyā (killing a brāhmaṇa), surāpāna (drinking liquor) and so on. The last work deals with the first three adhyāyas or chapters of the <em>Pūrvamīmāṁsā-sūtras</em> of Jaimini following in the footsteps of Kumārilabhaṭṭa (8th century A.D.) who was also known as Tautātita.</p>
			<p>Bhavadevabhaṭṭa was also an expert in Āyurveda (life-science or medicine and surgery) and astravidyā (military scien-ces). He is supposed to have composed works on horā or astrology also.</p>

			<word>bhāvanā</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;that which is produced&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Though the word is commonly used in the sense of an idea or a thought, it is frequently employed in a technical sense by several sciences.</p>
			<p>In the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika school, it is defined as a special quality of the mind, a saṁskāra or past impression, born out of experience and giving rise to memory.</p>
			<p>In the Pūrvamīmāṁsā school it denotes the mental activity of the person who intends to get some work done or do it himself. For instance, when Yajñadatta asks Devadatta, &#x2018;Bring the cow,&#x2019; the mental activity of Yajñadatta that induces Devadatta to bring the cow is called &#x2018;bhāvanā&#x2019; and is expressed through the words uttered by him. Hence it is called &#x2018;śābdī-bhāvanā&#x2019; or bhāvanā related to &#x2018;śabda&#x2019; or word. The mental activity that arises in devadatta on hearing those words is also a &#x2018;bhāvanā;&#x2019; but it is called &#x2018;ārthībhāvanā&#x2019; since this bhāvanā or mental activity is related to &#x2018;artha&#x2019; or utility.</p>
			<p>Since the Vedas (the karmakāṇḍa part that prescribes rituals) are &#x2018;apauruṣeya&#x2019; or impersonal, the śābdībhāvanā is inherent in their words of command.</p>
			<p>The purāṇas use the word in the sense of a deep-rooted mental impression based on which one sees the world or works in it. For instance sages like Sanaka or Sanandana who were endowed with brahmajñāna or knowledge of Brahman saw the world with &#x2018;brahma-bhāvanā,&#x2019; or that it is Brahman itself. Ordinary gods and human beings endowed with &#x2018;karma-bhāvanā&#x2019; saw it as fit for action. Extraordi-nary deities like the Hiraṇyagarbha who had &#x2018;brahma-karma-bhāvanā,&#x2019; saw it as Brahman but also fit for discharging the duties (karma = action, duties) allotted to them.</p>
			<p>In Āyurveda the word &#x2018;bhāvanā&#x2019; stands for the process of dissolving some powders of medical qualities in appropriate solvents to prepare the medicine.</p>

			<word>Bhāvanopaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a minor upaniṣad belonging to the Śākta school, dealing with Śakti or the Divine Mother and has been classed under the <em>Atharvaṇaveda</em>. The Śākta school holds that Brahman the Absolute, the ultimate cause and substratum of this universe, is also the Śakti or the primordial power. It is also called &#x2018;prakāśa&#x2019; or the Supreme Light. When it deliberates to manifest the creation out of itself—the deliberation itself being called &#x2018;vimarśa&#x2019;—it results in a movement or vibration known as &#x2018;spanda.&#x2019; The interplay of prakāśa and vimarśa increases the spanda gradually, resulting in a graded manifestation of this world of name and form. The rays emerging from the supreme light in the course of various stages of manifestation array themselves in a form pattern which is now well-known as Śrīcakra. It is a masterplan of the universe, a symbol image and abode of Śakti or the Divine Mother variously called as Lalitā (the Mother of grace), Rāja-rājeśvarī (Her most Imperial Majesty) or Kāmeśvarī (the Mother of love).</p>
			<p>The purāṇas describe the Śrīcakra as the central place of the city of the great Goddess. However, this Śrīcakra is not outside, in the external universe, but is within oneself. This upaniṣad teaches us the &#x2018;bhāvanā&#x2019; or the right attitude or mode of meditation to rediscover the Śrīcakra within oneself. Hence it is called <em>Bhāvanopaniṣad</em>.</p>
			<p>Since whatever is in the macrocosm, is also in the microcosm, by knowing the latter one can know the former. The bhāvanā or meditation taught here, starts from the outermost cakra or diagram of the Śrīcakra and traverses step by step, the whole gamut of the nine cakras up to the innermost. In the aspirant, the identity is established part by part, limb by limb, from the outermost to the innermost being, the very soul. As a culmination everything is experienced as pure consciousness and one&#x2019;s own body becomes full of bliss. The aspirant thus realizes the light or becomes one with it.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad declares that the act of meditation is itself worship; and gives symbolic meaning of terms like arghya (water offered for washing hands) or homa (duly consecrated fire-offerings).</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;that which causes  transmigration&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (200 B.C.) describes eight graded steps for controlling the mind. The last step is &#x2018;samādhi,&#x2019; perfect concentration, resulting in a superconscious experience. This samādhi, again, is twofold: samprajñāta and asamprajñāta. In the former, the object of concentration is fully revealed and known. In the latter the mind settles down into itself without any vṛttis or modifications. Hence there will be no jñāna or knowledge of any object in particular.</p>
			<p>This latter samādhi is also twofold: upāyapratyaya and bhavapratyaya. &#x2018;Prat-yaya&#x2019; means kāraṇa or cause. &#x2018;Bhava&#x2019; means saṁsāra or transmigratory existence. Since this latter samādhi does not give mokṣa or liberation, but causes bhava or transmigration, has been rightly called &#x2018;bhava-pratyaya.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Some yogis, endowed with apara-vairāgya or inferior spirit of renunciation, choose such objects as the pañca-bhūtas (the five elements such as earth and water), the indriyas (the sense-organs) or ahaṅkāra (the ego) and so on for their objects of meditation. When they attain asam-prajñāta samādhi through these, they attain a state which is similar to kaivalya or liberation. However, since they lack viveka-khyāti or the direct experience that the ātman (the Self) is separate from prakṛti (nature), they return to transmigratory existence after some time.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the Advaita Vedānta philosophy our real nature is the ātman or the Self which is pure consciousness. Our ignorance of our real nature—technically called &#x2018;avidyā&#x2019; or &#x2018;ajñāna&#x2019;—has led to our wrong identification with the body-mind complex resulting in saṁsāra or transmigratory existence. Hence, to attain mokṣa or liberation, we have to get rid of this avidyā or ajñāna through vidyā or jñāna (knowledge).</p>
			<p>In this connection, philosophers of the Advaita school have widely discussed the nature of this avidyā or ajñāna and have come to the conclusion that it is &#x2018;bhāvarūpa&#x2019; or positive and not &#x2018;abhāva-rūpa&#x2019; or negative since it is felt or experienced. For instance, when we say, &#x2018;I do not know anything,&#x2019; &#x2018;I am an ignorant person&#x2019; we actually feel or experience that ignorance. However, its reality has not been given the status of &#x2018;sat&#x2019; (&#x2018;that which exists&#x2019;) since it can be destroyed by knowledge.</p>

			<p>Worship of God as the Śakti (the Divine Power or Mother) is quite ancient in the Hindu religious tradition. One of the more well-known aspects of this Śakti, especially the fierce ones, is Kālī. Bhava-tārīṇī, which literally means &#x2018;one who helps the jīva or the individual soul to cross over saṁsāra or transmigratory existence,&#x2019; is one of the names by which Kālī is known in the Bengali tradition of Śakti worship. The deity at the famous temple of Kālī in Dakṣiṇeśvar (Calcutta) has been well-known as Bhavatāriṇi.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Purāṇas are the mythological lore of Hinduism and rank among its secondary scriptures. Hindu tradition lists 18 major purāṇas and another 18 minor purāṇas, all ascribed to the well-known sage Veda-vyāsa.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bhaviṣya-purāṇa</em> has been classed among the major purāṇas and hence sometimes called the <em>Bhaviṣya-mahāpurāṇa</em> also. According to one printed version, it is divided into four books: <em>Brahmaparva, Madhyamaparva, Pratisargaparva</em> and <em>Uttaraparva</em>. In all, there are 585 chapters and 26,000 ślokas. The last book is sometimes treated as an independent purāṇa entitled <em>Bhaviṣyottara-purāṇa</em>. Minus this book, the number of verses comes to 14,000 or 14,500, a number generally and widely accepted by the scholars based on the information given in other purāṇas like the <em>Matsya</em> and the <em>Agni</em>.</p>
			<p>This purāṇa belongs to the period A.D. 600-1000. Its last book, with its many references to kings including the Muslim invaders, known to history, has been considered as having many interpolations. The first book <em>Brāhmaparva</em> is undoubtedly the oldest part.</p>
			<p>As per another version, the purāṇa consists of five books: <em>Brāhmaparva, Vaiṣṇavaparva, Śaivaparva, Sauraparva</em> and <em>Pratisargaparva</em>. The total number of chapters is 605, the number of verses being 14,000.</p>
			<p>The whole purāṇa is a miscellany dealing with a bewildering variety of subjects. The upāsanā (worship) of Sūrya, the Sun-god, has been given a prominent place. Details concerning the construction of temples, making and consecration of images, varieties of vratas or religious observances motivated by desires, sins and their expiations, dāna or giving gifts—these ar some of the other subjects dealt with in the work.</p>
			<p>The prefix &#x2018;bhaviṣya&#x2019; (&#x2018;future&#x2019;) seems to have been given to it on the assumption that though an ancient work composed by the hoary sage Vedavyāsa, it predicts many events of the future.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the doctrine of difference and non-difference&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the important concepts discussed by the ṣaḍdarśanas or the six sys-tems of Indian Philosophy is that of bheda (difference) and abheda (non-difference). Once a basic doctrine is evolved, it can then be applied to the relationship between the jīva (individual soul) and Paramātman or Brahman (the Supreme Soul).</p>
			<p>Some of the schools of Vedānta like those of Bhāskara (A.D. 900) and Nimbārka (12th century A.D.) propounded this doct-rine of bhedābheda (bhedābheda-vāda) between the jīva and Brahman. There is both difference and identity between them, identity as pure consciousness and difference in powers and functions. Such bhedā-bheda is not inconceivable as can be seen in the relationship between guṇa (quality) and guṇin (the substance possessing the quality) or between jāti (a genus or class) and vyakti (an individual belonging to that class).</p>

			<p>Drums and kettledrums, of various types and sizes, have been in use in India since the ancient times. They have been associated both with war and with peace.</p>
			<p>A bherī or kettledrum is an essential part of the Hindu temple equipment. All the important festivals of the temple including the brahmotsava, start with bherī-tāḍana or beating the kettledrum. It is an invitation even to the gods in heaven to come down and attend the festival. The sound of the bherī is said to destroy the sins of all those that hear it. Even the animal from whose hide the instrument has been made, is said to attain heaven.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;begging&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Though begging has been looked down upon in the modern times, in ancient and medieval India, it was generally given an honourable place.</p>
			<p>Bhikṣā or begging as described in the smṛtis and dharmaśātras falls into two categories: that which is prescribed as a religious duty and that which is allowed as a means of sustenance.</p>
			<p>A brahmacārin (initiated Vedic student) had to obtain alms by bhikṣā since it was considered as very pure. Though on the day of his upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread, yajñopavīta, making initiation into the Vedic studies) he has to beg the first morsel of food from his own mother, he could, later on, get it from the ladies (or men) from several houses. The food got thus had to be kept before his teacher and the boy could consume only that much as was allotted by him. Excess food was not to be wasted but given to needy persons, or even left under a tree for animals.</p>
			<p>Though alms could be accepted from persons of all castes (except the caṇḍālas or outcastes and patitas or the morally depraved) in the earlier years, restrictions regarding caste were gradually tightened, so much so, that a brahmacārin could not, often, get enough food to eat. On such occasions he was permitted to beg from the members of his own family or even from the teacher himself.</p>
			<p>It was obligatory for the householders to give food to the brahmacārins as also monks according to their ability and any refusal would result in the destruction of their religious merit.</p>
			<p>A saṁnyāsin or a monk was expected to be a &#x2018;parivrājaka&#x2019; or an itinerant, and hence, bhikṣā was the only means of his sustenance. However, he was allowed to beg alms only once a day (in day-time) and that too, not from more than seven houses, without selecting them before-hand. Such bhikṣā was called &#x2018;mādhukarī&#x2019; (collecting food like bees collecting honey; madhu = honey) and was considered very pure. As regards the caste of the persons from whom alms could be accepted, opinion is divided in the dharmaśāstras.</p>
			<p>Begging was allowed to others, but under certain restrictions. Begging (whether for food or for wealth) was permitted for the sake of the teacher, for one&#x2019;s first marriage, for a sacrifice, to support one&#x2019;s parents or as a prāyaścitta (expiation). What was obtained from such begging had to be utilized for that parti-cular purpose only.</p>

			<p>Śiva, the last deity of the Hindu Trinity, is invariably worshipped as the liṅga. (See <ref>LIṄGA</ref>.) However, several anthropomorphic forms too have been attributed to him. One such form belonging to his ugra or raudra (terrific) aspect is the Bhikṣāṭana-mūrti or the &#x2018;begging-form&#x2019;.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>The story goes that he cut off the fifth head of Brahmā, the Creator, with his fingernail, since the latter was irreve-rent. The severed head or skull, however, stuck to his finger; and the sin of brahma-hatyā (See <ref>BRAHMAHATYĀ</ref>.) incurred thus had to be expiated. So, he had to roam about the earth for 12 years, begging his food in the skull-cup. It is this form that is known as the &#x2018;Bhikṣāṭana-mūrti.&#x2019; As soon as he entered Vārāṇasī (Kāśī or Banaras) he was freed from this sin.</p>
			<p>In iconographical works the Bhikṣā-ṭana-mūrti is shown as a naked person with matted hair, wearing a white yajñopavīta or sacred thread, the skull-cup sticking in his hand and pādukās (wooden sandals) on his feet. Sometimes a snake as a waist-band, an upper cloth of deer-skin and some ornaments may also be shown.</p>
			<p>Images of this Bhikṣāṭana-mūrti are quite popular and are found in all the major temples in South India. Bronze icons too are sometimes seen kept in some temples.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>A bhikṣu is one who lives on alms got by begging. However, all beggars are not bhikṣus. The word is used more in a technical sense and applies to religious mendicants.</p>
			<p>Renouncing the world and the worldly life in order to dedicate oneself to spiritual pursuits has been an ancient practice in India. Such persons generally moved about from place to place, sustaining themselves by begging.</p>
			<p>Such a life of renunciation could be adopted from any stage of life—brahmacarya or the stage of a Vedic student, gārhasthya or the stage of a householder and vānaprastha or the stage of a forest dweller.</p>
			<p>A bhikṣu represented the order of saṁnyāsa. He had to live a life of strict self-control and strive his utmost for mokṣa or liberation.</p>
			<p>A <em>Bhikṣusūtra</em> attributed to one Karmanda has been mentioned in some dharmaśāstra works, but has not been traced. Another work of the same name attributed to Pārāśarya (Vyāsa) is perhaps the extant <em>Brahmasūtras</em> or an earlier version of it.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;bhikṣu&#x2019; in course of time, came to represent the Buddhist and the Jain mendicants, rather than the Hindu saṁnyāsins.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, the most widely studied scripture of Hinduism has in course of time given rise to a voluminous Gītā-literature. One of the minor gītās that forms part of another celebrated gītā, the <em>Uddhavagītā</em> (<em>vide Bhāgavata</em> 11.7-29) is the <em>Bhikṣugītā</em> (11.23)</p>
			<p>In the country of Avantī, there lived a brāhmaṇa rolling in wealth but a miser to the core. His peevish and rude behaviour resulted in successfully driving away all his kith and kin. Wilful neglect of duties, both temporal and scriptural, made the gods angry with him and they withdrew their grace. So, he lost all his wealth and got vairāgya or spirit of renunciation which made him reflect on his past life and behaviour. He then took to the life of a bhikṣu or mendicant. Wherever he went he was reviled and even assaulted because of his past history. However, he stoically put up with everything taking it all as due to his own past karma. He then taught his own mind thus: &#x2018;I gave so much trouble to this body in order to earn wealth and not for dharma (righteousness) or kāma (pleasure of the flesh). Wealth thus accumulated by the greedy and the miserly ones ruins all the good one may have. Wealth gives rise to many evils like theft, violence, lust, vanity, and enmity even amongst the loved ones. Those who waste this invaluable human birth in the pursuit of wealth ruin themselves. When death knocks at our doors, money can never rescue us; nor do people or objects of desire. God, the infinitely merciful one, has blessed me thus by deliberately taking away my wealth and possessions. I will now spend the rest of my life in tapas or austerity and be ever vigilant against all selfishness.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;It is the mind—being under the influence of the three guṇas—that is responsible for our weal or woe. Control of this mind is the best of yogas. One who successfully accomplishes it is verily a god!&#x2019;</p>

		<description>
			<p>This is a small work counted among the minor Upaniṣads and is said to belong to the <em>Śukla Yajurveda</em>. It is devoted to a description of the bhikṣus or mendicants or saṁnyāsins.</p>
			<p>The bhikṣus desiring for mokṣa or liberation are of four types: the kuṭīcakas, the bahūdakas, the haṁsas and the paramahaṁsas.</p>
			<p>The kuṭīcakas take eight grāsas or mouthfuls of food daily and strive for mokṣa through the path of yoga. Gautama, Bharadvāja, Yājñavalkya, Vasiṣṭha and others belong to this group.</p>
			<p>The bahūdakas wear the insignia of a monk like red-robes, three bamboo staves tied together, a water-pot and so on. They too live upon eight mouthfuls of food got by begging. They avoid honey and flesh even though offered by the host.</p>
			<p>The haṁsas are itinerant monks who do not stay in a place for more than a day if it is a village or five days if it is a city or seven days if it is a place of pilgrimage. They observe the Cāndrāyaṇa rite and practise yoga to obtain mokṣa.</p>
			<p>The paramahaṁsas like Saṁvartaka, Āruṇi, Śvetaketu, Jaḍabharata, Śuka and others sustain themselves on eight mouthfuls of food, practise yoga and pray for attaining mokṣa.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad gives a long description of their way of life. They live in secluded places like abandoned houses, burial grounds, temples or under trees or on the banks of rivers. They are unconcerned about their dress and may even move about naked. They accept alms from all, irrespective of their caste. They have transcended all dualities like good and bad and ever contemplate on the Ātman. Living thus they give up the body when the time comes to depart.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The heroes and the villains portrayed in the two epics—the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Mahābhārata</em>—have not only swayed the emotions of the Indian masses for millennia but also kept the ideals before them: the positive ideals or how to be, and the negative ideals or how not to be.</p>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Bhīṣma, Vidura and the Pāṇḍava heroes of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> have provided the positive ideals.</p>
			<p>Bhīma, or Bhīmasena the second of the Pāṇḍavas, was not only the very personification of physical prowess but also of fearlessness. Born to Kuntī, the first wife of the king Pāṇḍu, by the grace of Vāyu, the god of wind, Bhīma was celebrated for his large frame and immense strength equal to that of &#x2018;ten thousand elephants!&#x2019;All efforts of the wily Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, an inveterate enemy of the Pāṇḍavas and especially of Bīma, to liquidate him were set at naught by the latter&#x2019;s strength aided by divine grace. Feeding with poisonous food, attack by venomous reptiles and arson were some of the methods tried out by Duryodhana.</p>
			<p>Bhīma was an adept in the art of fighting with the gadā or the mace, in which he had been vigorously trained by Balarāma, the elder brother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He had been presented with a divine mace by Mayāsura, the chief architect of the Asuras or demons. Apart from Draupadī, the common wife of the Pāṇḍava brothers, Bhīma had wedded Hiḍimbā and Jalan-dharā. Ghaṭotkaca, another colossus, was his son from Hiḍimbā.</p>
			<p>The number of demons and villains killed by Bhīma was legion: Hiḍimbāsura, Bakāsura, Jarāsandha and Kīcaka to name a few. He did so under great personal risk but inspired by the desire to protect the good, the meek and the weak.</p>
			<p>The crowning success of Bhīma was achieved when he killed Duśśāsana and Duryodhana (the eldest of the Kaurava brothers) in the Kurukṣetra war, thus avenging all the wrongs done by them to the Pāṇḍava family.</p>
			<p>He was a great source of strength and support to Yudhiṣṭhira, after the latter was crowned as the emperor at Hastināpura.</p>
			<p>In spite of his massive appearance and all his fierce exploits, Bhīma had a simple and tender heart and was deeply devoted to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In all religions, centres of pilgrimage occupy an important place since they bring peace, solace and spiritual upliftment to the persons that visit them. In Hinduism such pilgrim centres are innumerable. Sea-beaches, banks of rivers, hills and dales as also forests are the most favoured places for the location of such centres. they are, almost invariably, associated with some ancient legends concerned with gods or holy persons; or, the resorts of saints and sages. And, of course, there must be some temples too.</p>
			<p>One of the less known rivers of India is the Bhīmā. Taking its birth in the Western Ghats from the summit of the Sahya mountain in Maharashtra, it flows towards the south-east and joins the river Kṛṣṇā, a little north of Raichur in Karnataka.</p>
			<p>At the source of this river is situated the famous Jyotirliṅga, Bhīmāśaṅkara, one of the twelve such liṅgas mentioned in the ancient and medieval works of Hinduism.</p>
			<p>According to one of the legends, Lord Śiva, after vanquishing Tripurāsura, came to this place for rest. At that time, Bhīmaka, a king of Ayodhyā, had been doing tapas or penance there to propitiate Śiva. Being pleased by his tapas Śiva revealed himself to the king and offered a boon. The king requested Śiva that the beads of perspiration on his forehead be discharged as a river for the purification of mankind. Thus was born the river Bhīmā.</p>
			<p>The river Indrāyaṇī joins Bhīmā near Tulāpur.</p>
			<p>Phaṇḍarāpura, the well-known place of pilgrimage of Maharashtra is situated on the right bank of Bhīmā.</p>
			<p>The river Bhīmā is also called Bhīmarathī; and occasionally, as Mahānadī too.</p>
			<p>The word Bhīmā is sometimes used to denote Durgā.</p>

			<word>Bhīmaikādaśī</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;ekādaśī [associated with] Bhīma&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the most well-known and popular days of religious observances in the lunar calendar of the Hindus, is the ekādaśī. It is the eleventh day from the full-moon or the new-moon, each month. It is considered as a &#x2018;vrata&#x2019; or a religious observance, characterised mainly by fasting.</p>
			<p>(See <ref>EKĀDAŚĪ</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>Out of the several ekādaśīs considered as even more sacred, Bhīmaikādaśī is one. According to the <em>Matsyapurāṇa</em>. (69.19-65) Śrī Kṛṣṇa is said to have imparted the knowledge of the Bhīma-dvādaṣī vrata including those rites to be performed on the daśamī (the tenth) and the ekādaśī (the eleventh) days to Bhīma, the second of the Pāṇḍava princes. Hence the names &#x2018;Bhimaikādaśī&#x2019; and &#x2018;Bhīmadvādaśī&#x2019;. They are observed on the eleventh and the twelfth of the bright fortnight of the month of Māgha (February), with or without the conjunction of the star Puṣya. The latter day used to be called &#x2018;Kalyāṇinī&#x2019; also.</p>
			<p>On the tenth day (Māgha śukla daśamī) the votary is expected to take a bath after applying ghee to his body and worship Viṣṇu with the mantra &#x2018;<em>Oṁ namo</em> <em>nārāyaṇāya</em>&#x2019; followed by the worship of Garuḍa, Śiva and Gaṇeśa. On the eleventh day (ekādaśī) a total fast is to be observed. On the next day (dvādaśī) he has to bathe in a river, raise a maṇḍapa or a pavilion in front of his house, hang a jar full of water but with a hole at the bottom, receive the drops of water on his palm repeating the name of God throughout the night and perform homa (offering oblations into a duly consecrated fire) the next morning with the help of twelve priests learned in the Vedas, honouring them suitably at the end. On the thirteenth day (trayodaśī), 13 cows have to be donated. He should then listen to the itihāsas and purāṇas.</p>
			<p>According to some versions, this vrata was taught by the sage Pulastya to the king Bhīma who was the father of Damayantī, the wife of Nala.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;propitiatory rite [to counter the effects of] Bhīmarathī&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Śāntis are propitiatory rites performed with a view to countering the evil effects of malevolent spirits, unlucky stars, ill-omens including bad dreams or un-favourable deities.</p>
			<p>When a person reaches the age of 77 years, 7 months and 7 days, that particular night is called &#x2018;Bhīmarathī&#x2019; since it is said to be terrible (bhīma = terrible) and difficult to survive. The rite to be performed to offset its effects is called &#x2018;Bhīmaratha-śānti,&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bhimarathī-śānti&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>It may be performed on the completion of the seventieth year itself. Its object is to protect his life as also the lives and properties of all his children and grand-children.</p>
			<p>The rite involves several acts like nāndīśrāddha (See <ref>ĀBHYUDAYIKA-ŚRĀDDHA</ref>.), kalaśasthāpana (ceremonially establishing the holy water pot), worship of deities like Bhīma-mṛtyuñjaya, Durgā, Gaṇapati and Viṣṇu as also the Navagrahas (the nine planets), chanting of Vedic hymns like the <em>Rudra</em> and the <em>Camaka</em>, the <em>Śrīsūkta</em> and the <em>Bhūsūkta</em>, homas (offering oblations into duly consecrated fires), the main homa being the Mṛtyuñjaya-homa with the well-known hymn, &#x2018;<em>tryambakaṁ yajāmane&#x2019;</em> as also an abhiṣeka (ceremonial sprinkling of consecrated waters) to the Yajamāna, the performer. He should then give gifts to the prescribed persons, and get the blessings of the priests and the other brāhmaṇas involved in the rite.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the terrible&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Mahābhārata</em>, the bigger of the two epics of Hinduism and the greatest didactic poem of the world, has held up before us many a hero fit to be emulated if not adored. And, Bhīṣma, the grand-sire of the Kaurava race, is pre-eminent among them. Ranked as next only to Kṛṣṇa, considered as God-incarnate, Bhīṣma was not only the greatest of the warriors of his times, he was also a towering intellect and a paragon of virtues.</p>
			<p>Originally a Vasu (one of the eight attendants of Indra) he was born, due to a curse, as the eighth son of the king Śantanu in Gaṅgā, the river goddess. Gaṅgā christened him as &#x2018;Devavrata,&#x2019; brought him up well, got him well-educated and trained under the warrior-sage Paraśurāma and then handed him back to the king Śantanu. The king took him to his capital, Hastināpura, and made him the Yuvarāja or the crown-prince.</p>
			<p>One day, Śantanu who had gone out hunting, fell in love with Satyavatī, the daughter of the chieftain of the fishermen. When he proposed to marry her, the chieftain laid the condition that the son that would be born in her should be the heir to the throne. The king obviously could not concede the demand as it would be a great injustice to Devavrata, who was the fittest heir anointed to be so. However, the lovelorn king could neither forget the girl nor consent to the condition laid by her father. This conflict had a devastating effect on him. When Devavrata noticed it and learnt of the details, he went to the chieftain, vowed before him that he would willingly abdicate his right over the kingdom, nor would he ever marry so that his progeny could never stake its claim over it. This terrible vow earned him the name &#x2018;Bhīṣma,&#x2019; &#x2018;the terrible&#x2019; which stuck.</p>
			<p>Śantanu married satyavatī and begot two sons—Citrāṅgada and Vicitravīrya. Both of them died without issues. Then, at the request of Satyavatī and as per the &#x2018;niyoga&#x2019; custom (See <ref>NIYOGA</ref> for details.) that was prevalent during those days, sage Vyāsa raised issues in Ambikā and Ambālikā the queens of Vicitravīrya. The two sons were named Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu. The former was born blind.</p>
			<p>Bhīṣma brought them up, got them married and, they in course of time, had their own children: the hundred Kauravas and the five Pāṇḍavas. Duryodhana and Duśśāsana were the first two among the Kauravas. The Pāṇḍvas were: Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.</p>
			<p>There was constant rivalry between these two groups of cousins, Duryodhana being the villain while Yudhiṣṭhira was the paragon of dharma or righteousness. Duryodhana made several attempts to decimate the Pāṇḍavas, but destiny always sided with the latter. Bhīṣma had quite a tough time in forging a working alliance between them and his sage counsels often had their effect and prevented many a crisis.</p>
			<p>After the marriage of the Pāṇḍavas with Draupadī, Bhīṣma was instrumental in recalling them from their self-imposed exile and returning them their share of the kingdom. The Pāṇḍavas built a beauti-ful capital city and named it Indraprastha. However, Duryodhana succeeded in usurping their kingdom by jealous machinations and insulted Draupadī, the Pāṇḍava queen, in the open assembly. But their kingdom and wealth were restored to them by the intervention of the blind king Dhṛtarāṣṭra.</p>
			<p>This truce was however shortlived. In a subsequent game of dice, Yudhiṣṭhira lost everything and when the Pāṇḍavas later demanded their kingdom back, as per the agreement, Duryodhana refused it, resulting in the well-known Kurukṣetra war. Bhīṣma was the first commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army. Though he fought valiantly he was ultimately downed by Arjuna. Since he had the special boon of dying at will, he chose to live on—though badly wounded—for a period of 58 days, till the uttarāyaṇa or the period of the northern solstice. At the behest of Kṛṣṇa, Bhīṣma gave a long discourse on the various aspects of dharma in answer to the questions raised by Yudhiṣṭhira. This section of the <em>Mahā-bhārata</em> known as the <em>Śāntiparva</em> is an invaluable source of dharma even now. He then gave up the body in yoga.</p>

			<p>Derived from the verbal root &#x2018;bhuj&#x2019; (&#x2018;to eat, to enjoy&#x2019;) the word &#x2018;bhoga&#x2019; is commonly used to denote enjoyment or experience of pleasure and pain. In a more technical sense, it denotes such experience brought about by karma or action done in earlier lives.</p>
			<p>In temple rituals, the food offerings made to the deity through the image, are called &#x2018;bhoga&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>In Hindu astronomy, a part of the ecliptic, occupied by each of the 27 nakṣatras or asterisms, is known as &#x2018;bhoga&#x2019;.</p>

			<word>bhoga-mūrti</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;icon [that gives] happiness&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The icons of Viṣṇu are generally of four varieties: bhogamūrti, yogamūrti, vīramūrti and ābhicārikamūrti. They respectively concern the attitudes of happiness, meditation, heroism and exorcism. Each one of these may again be sculptured in three possible postures: sthānaka (standing), āsīna (seated) and śayāna (recumbent). Further, each variety has three subdivisions: uttama (superior), madhyama (middling) and adhama (inferior).</p>
			<p>The bhogamūrti of the sthānaka type, called &#x2018;bhoga-sthānaka-mūrti&#x2019;, has four hands. The two upper hands carry the cakra (discus) and śaṅkha (conch). The right lower hands exhibits the gesture of abhaya (protection) or varada (boon-giving). The left lower hand rests on the hip. The complexion is śyāma or dark blue. Śrīdevī (Lakṣmī) and Bhūdevī (Mother-earth) are shown as the consorts.</p>
			<p>In the uttama variety, the deity is surrounded by several sages, celestial beings and attendants. In the madhyama and the adhama versions, the number of these subsidiary beings is gradually reduced.</p>
			<p>In the bhogamūrti of the āsīna type called &#x2018;bhogāsanamūrti&#x2019;, the same description holds good. Viṣṇu is shown as seated on a splendid throne. In rare cases, he may be shown as seated on the Ananta or the thousand-hooded serpent.</p>
			<p>In the bhogamūrti of the śayāna type, called &#x2018;bhoga-śayāna-mūrti&#x2019;, the god is shown in a recumbent posture. One of the right hands supports the head and one of the left hands is stretched till the thigh. The śaṅkha (conch) and the cakra (discus) may be shown in the other two hands. Sometimes, they are shown independently, the two extra hands being absent. Either Śrīdevī (Lakṣmī) or both Śrīdevī and Bhūdevī (Mother-earth) are shown near the feet. The fourfaced Brahmā on the lotus emanating from the navel is another feature.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the aṅga or jīva who enjoys [everything through liṅga or Śiva or God]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the several aspects of Śaivism is Vīraśaivism which has a very large following in Karnataka. It calls the Divine as &#x2018;sthala.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Though this word means space, it is used in a more technical sense, to indicate the omnipresent nature of the Divine.</p>
			<p>This sthala bifurcates itself into &#x2018;liṅga,&#x2019; the personal God and &#x2018;aṅga,&#x2019; the individual soul, also called jīva.</p>
			<p>Both the liṅga and the aṅga undergo a threefold manifestation: iṣṭaliṅga, prāṇa-liṅga and bhāvaliṅga; tyāgāṅga, bhogāṅga and yogāṅga.</p>
			<p>When the jīva renounces attachment to worldly objects, he is called &#x2018;tyāgāṅga.&#x2019; The iṣṭaliṅga given to him by his guru at the time of dīkṣā or initiation is the object of his worship. When he gives up all casual pleasures and takes delight only in what is conducive to spiritual growth, he is called bhogāṅga and the prāṇaliṅga, Śiva established in his heart, becomes the object of his worship. On further progress in the inner life, his old casual body is destroyed and a new state of consciousness is formed. In this state the jīva is called yogāṅga since this leads him to yoga or union with Śiva established in the sahasrāracakra, the thousand petalled lotus situated in the crown of the head.</p>

			<p>It is common for a person in distress to pledge his property—whether movable or immovable—with someone and borrow money. The dharmaśāstras or law-books of Hinduism call this as &#x2018;ādhi.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>An object pledged thus is called &#x2018;gopya&#x2019; if it is just to be kept in safe custody till the pledge is redeemed; or as &#x2018;bhogya&#x2019; if it is permitted to be used or enjoyed.</p>
			<p>The pledger loses his ownership over the object if he does not repay the debt within the stipulated time. If there is no time limit, the ownership is retained until the debt is repaid.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Bhojarāja or the king Bhoja is a well-known figure in Sanskrit literature. Belonging to the Paramāra dynasty of Māḷava (Malwa) he lived in the 11th century A.D. Some scholars assign him to the period A.D. 1010-1055. His capital was Dhārā.</p>
			<p>The number of works attributed to him is 34. They belong to a variety of fields of knowledge that include astro-nomy, astrology, medicine and surgery, grammar, economics and even engineering sciences. However, it is more reasonable to believe that these works were written by the various scholars in his kingdom under his patronage.</p>
			<p>At present, only the following five works have been found: <em>Campū-rāmāyaṇa, Rājamārtāṇḍa, Tattvaprakāśa, Sarasvatī-kaṇṭhābhāraṇa</em> and <em>Śṛṅgāraprakāśa</em>.</p>
			<p>The second work, also called <em>Bhoja-vṛtti,</em> is an independent commentary on<em> </em>the <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali. It is brief but lucid. The third work is on Śaivism. Bhoja was a śaiva by faith. The last two deal with alaṅkāra or poetics and dramaturgy.</p>

			<word>bhojana</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;that which is eaten,&#x2019; &#x2018;food&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Every act of the Hindu, including those connected with his daily routine, is permeated by the spirit of religion. Bhojana or taking meal is a very important part of such a daily routine.</p>
			<p>According to <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (6.5.4; 6.5.1; 6.7; 7.26.2) body and mind are closely interconnected; and the food eaten by us affects our mind. Since purity of food is conducive to the purity of mind, great attention has to be paid to what we eat. This regulation of food concerns four aspects:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>quality;</li>
				 <li>quantity;</li>
				 <li>time and</li>
				 <li>place.</li>
			 </ol>
			<p>The food should be conducive not only to health and strength but also to purity of mind. Hence, food classified as sāttvic (<em>vide</em> <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> 17.7) should always be preferred.</p>
			<p>As regards the quantity, it should be neither &#x2018;too much,&#x2019; nor &#x2018;too little.&#x2019; Works on the Āyurveda (the science of longevity or health) prescribe that half the stomach is to be filled with solid food, a quarter with liquid food or water, leaving the last quarter for the circulation of wind or air. Whereas young brahmacārins, who are expected to do a lot of work and study in their gurukulas, are permitted to eat sumptuously, the vānaprasthins (forest dwellers) and the saṁnyāsins (monks) have to eat very limited quantities, as much as is necessary to maintain general health and strength, necessary for spiritual pursuits.</p>
			<p>Coming to the time, the general rule is that one should eat only when one is hungry. The time should also be adjusted to suit one&#x2019;s religious practices, in a way that does not disturb their tenor. Consuming food or drinks during the eclipses of the sun or the moon is strictly prohibited.</p>
			<p>Concerning the place where food can be taken, physical cleanliness and pleasing sights are strongly recommended. Eating in moving vehicles or in a public place in full view of others has been prohibited. There may have been compelling reasons during those times, when these rules had been made, for such prohibition, though they are not possible to observe now-a-days.</p>
			<p>Since purity of food conduces to purity of mind, the dharmaśāstras have dealt with this subject rather in great detail.</p>
			<p>Certain food articles like garlic and onion, are &#x2018;jātiduṣṭa&#x2019; or defective by their very nature (jāti = species, nature) and hence unfit for consumption.</p>
			<p>Others that get polluted due to the touch of unclean hands or animals, (called &#x2018;kriyāduṣṭa&#x2019;) or belonging to the morally depraved persons (called &#x2018;parigraha-duṣṭa&#x2019;) or from the houses of those observing aśauca or ceremonial impurity (due to birth or death in that house) are also prohibited.</p>
			<p>In some of the works, it is stated that if one contemplates on the act of eating as a yajña or sacrifice, he will reap great benefits (<em>vide</em> <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> 5.19).</p>
			<p>Facing east or north at the time of eating, observing silence during eating and repeating the name of God in between two morsels, restricting the food of the house-holder to two square meals per day, inscribing certain religious symbols below the plate or the leaf used for food, showing due respect to the food when it is brought for serving, keeping away small quantities of food as bali or offering to Yama (the god of death) and others—these are some of the interesting side-lights in these religious works, concerning bhojana.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the enjoyer,&#x2019; or &#x2018;the experiencer&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The two words kartṛ or kartā (&#x2018;the doer&#x2019;) and bhoktṛ or bhoktā (&#x2018;the enjoyer,&#x2019; &#x2018;the experiencer&#x2019;) are commonly used in the Hindu philosophical works as applied to the jīvātman (the individual soul). Though the ātman (the Self or the soul) is ever free, how he becomes bound as the jīvātman due to association with avidyā or ajñāna (nescience) or prakṛti (nature) is a question that can never be answered satisfactorily since our mind which raises this question is itself the product of that nescience.</p>
			<p>Once the existence of the jīvātman which is a matter of our common experience is conceded, its corollaries too can be accepted. He is hence both the kartṛ and the bhoktṛ of actions. He experiences the results of all actions done by him. It is this fact of his being a doer and the experiencer of actions and their fruits that results in his bondage leading to rebirth.</p>
			<p>Meditation on the ātman as his true Self, which is neither the kartṛ nor the bhoktṛ will ultimately lead to mokṣa or liberation from transmigration.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the Hindu philosophical works, knowledge is of two kinds: pramā or true knowledge and bhrama or false knowledge.</p>
			<p>Bhrama (also called &#x2018;viparyaya&#x2019;), sometimes described as &#x2018;error&#x2019; or &#x2018;illusion&#x2019;, may be caused by the defects in the perceptive system, which includes the sense-organs as also the mind, or certain external factors or even false logic.</p>
			<p>When one moon is seen as two or the conch as yellow in colour, the defect lies in the sense-organs. If one infers the existence of fire at a distance by mistaking the mist there for smoke, the error is caused by an external factor. If some &#x2018;scriptures&#x2019; are accepted as &#x2018;true and authoritative&#x2019; by a section of people, those opposed to them attribute the &#x2018;error&#x2019; to &#x2018;false logic.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The oft-quoted examples for bhrama in the Vedāntic texts are: seeing a snake in a rope in insufficient light (rajjusarpa-nyāya), silver in nacre on a moonlit night<em> </em>(śukti-rajata-nyāya), water in a mirage on a hot summer day (jala-marīcikā-nyāya) or a person in a stump of tree (sthāṇu-puruṣa-nyāya).</p>
			<p>A detailed analysis of some of these examples—especially the śukti-rajata-nyāya—in order to determine the exact nature of the error is a special feature of these texts.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;bhrama&#x2019; is sometimes used to denote a covered arcade or an enclosed place of religious retirement meant for mendicants, generally attached to a temple.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Vācaspati Miśra (9th century A.D.) of the <em>Bhāmatī</em> fame, a prominent teacher of Advaita Vedānta in the post-Śaṅkara period, refers to two kinds of avidyā or nescience. The first is the psychological avidyā in the form of &#x2018;bhrama-saṁskāras&#x2019; or error impressions; the second is the primal, positive avidyā, which produces the beginningless series of delusions and saṁskāras or impressions. The latter, he calls &#x2018;mūlāvidyā&#x2019; or the &#x2018;kāraṇāvidyā&#x2019; (primal nescience), which produces the former which is &#x2018;tūlāvidyā&#x2019; or &#x2018;kāryāvidyā&#x2019; (derivative nescience).</p>
			<p>Bhramasaṁskāras can be removed by the cognition of the true or real objects whereas the mūlāvidyā can be destroyed only by the realization of Brahman.</p>

			<p>Patañjali (200 B.C.) in his well-known treatise, the <em>Yogasūtras</em>, lists eight serious obstacles to yoga. Out of these—technically called &#x2018;antarāyas&#x2019;—bhrāntidarśana or false perception, is the seventh. It is a serious obstacle and requires greater effort as also more tactful handling to prevent it or eliminate it.</p>
			<p>At the intellectual level, false perception can manifest itself as misunderstanding the teachings of the guru and the scriptures. This can be due to dullness or perversion of the intellect or even self-conceit. Discussions with the guru in all humility can help in solving it.</p>
			<p>False perception is possible at the psychic level also. Wrong methods of practice can lead to hallucinations. They can be remedied by consulting spiritually advanced souls.</p>
			<p>True experience gives joy and peace whereas the false one may not have any impact or may even cause unhappiness, fear, restlessness and tension.</p>
			<p>Psychic experiences like clairvoyance and clairaudience, though true in themselves, can produce a false sense of self-realization thus blocking further progress. They too come under &#x2018;bhrāntidarśana.&#x2019; It needs great strength and wisdom to transcend the temptations of such psychic powers as they often develop as a matter of course in spiritual aspirants. Patañjali himself gives the warning in the sūtra 3.51.</p>

			<p>Festivals are part and parcel of popular religion in every society. One of the comparatively minor festivals in Hinduism, generally tagged on to the major festival Dīpāvalī, is Bhrātṛ-dvitīyā, also known as &#x2018;Yama-dvitīyā&#x2019;. It occurs on the second day of the bright half of the month Kārttika (generally in November).</p>
			<p>The legend goes that on this day, Yamunā, the river goddess, invited her brother Yama (the god of Death) to her house and entertained him with a feast to show her sisterly affection.</p>
			<p>On this day sisters invite their brothers to their houses and feed them sumptuously. Brothers on their part give them presents. It is a day of joy of reunion of sisters and brothers who may be living, after their marriage and establishing their own families, in distant places.</p>
			<p>Worship of Yama, the god of Death and of Citragupta, his chief lieutenant are sometimes performed.</p>
			<p>Worshipping and entertaining an image made of flour or cowdung, which represents a brother living in a far off place, is also observed in some regions.</p>
			<p>Persons living on the banks of the river Yamunā are expected to bathe in the river on this day, before observing the rituals connected with this festival.</p>
			<p>Prayers are offered by the sisters for the long life and freedom from dangers, of their brothers.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the roaster&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>&#x2018;Bhṛgu&#x2019; is a well-known name that appears in several works, both Vedic and Paurāṇic. Assuming that the word has been derived from the root &#x2018;bhṛj&#x2019; or &#x2018;bhrāj&#x2019; (&#x2018;to burn or to roast&#x2019;) it could have been the name of the fire-priest by whose magical power the altar fire was kindled. According to a myth, god Mātariśvan brought lightning from the heavens to this earth and taught the art of kindling fire with araṇis or fire-sticks, to the Bhṛgus (&#x2018;bhārgavāḥ&#x2019;), the Āṇgirasas and the Atharvans.</p>
			<p>The sage Bhṛgu has been described as the mānasaputra or mindborn son of Brahmā, the Creator. Sometimes he has been stated to be the son of god Varuṇa or even of Indra. He was the father of Lakṣmī the spouse of Viṣṇu. (Hence the name &#x2018;Bhārgavī&#x2019; has been applied to her.) In other incarnations he was the father of Śukrācārya (the guru of the asuras or demons) and of sages like Cyavana. He is said to have once tested the Trinity—Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva—and come to the conclusion that Viṣṇu was the best among them and that he alone deserved worship.</p>
			<p>He is one of the well-known sages who were &#x2018;gotra-pravartakas,&#x2019; originators of gotras or lineage. Hence his descendants are called &#x2018;Bhārgavas.&#x2019; Sages Jamadagni and Paraśurāma belonged to this gotra.</p>
			<p>The <em>Mahābhārata</em> pictures him as a great savant often delivering discourses on abstruse matters.</p>
			<p>He was one of the four sages—the other three being Marīci, Atri and Kaśyapa—who elaborated the Vaikhānasa Āgama precepts followed by some Vaiṣṇava sects.</p>
			<p>The place where Bhṛgu is said to have performed austerities is known as Bhṛgu-Kaccha. It is situated on the bank of the river Narmadā near its confluence with the sea. It is now known as Broach, situated in the Gujarat State. At the place known as the Daśāśvamedha Ghāṭ, the king Bali is said to have performed the horse sacrifice. It was here that he propitiated Vāmana (the dwarf-incarnation of Viṣṇu) and granted him the boon of &#x2018;land covered in three steps.&#x2019; The city itself is considered to be very ancient, the original &#x2018;Bhṛgupura&#x2019; (city of Bhṛgu) being built by Bhṛgu himself.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hindu astrology accepts and bases its calculations on the twelve rāśis (signs of the Zodiac) and nine grahas or planets (including Rāhu and Ketu). There is a popular belief that a work called <em>Bhṛgu-saṁhitā</em> exists, in which the readings of all possible horoscopes got by the permutation and combination of these twelve rāśis and nine grahas are given. By just referring to the particular horoscope given there with ours, we can know everything about our past, present and future.</p>
			<p>Some scholars have calculated that a complete <em>Bhṛgusaṁhitā</em> would have to contain 7,46,49,000 horoscopes and at least ten times this number, of ślokas, assuming a minimum of ten ślokas per horoscope.</p>
			<p>The book itself has not been found. Here and there, some astrologers claim to possess parts or the whole of the work which is hard to believe. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to accommodate such a voluminous work even in a big library.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to an account in the <em>Kālikāpurāṇa (</em>chapter 45) Bhṛṅgin along with Mahākāla, was a door keeper at Śiva&#x2019;s place as also a general of his troops. But other accounts in the purāṇas describe him as a sage who was devoted only to Śiva and looked down upon Pārvatī, Śiva&#x2019;s spouse. At Pārvatī&#x2019;s request to &#x2018;teach him a lesson&#x2019; Śiva assumed the Ardhanārīśvara form. When Bhṛṅgin arrived at Kailāsa to pay his obeisance to Śiva which included pradakṣiṇā or circumambulation also, he is said to have become a &#x2018;bhṛṅga&#x2019; or a beetle, and bored a hole in the middle so that he could go round Śiva only to the exclusion of Pārvatī! Hence the name Bhṛṅgin. When Pārvatī cursed him to become weak and emaciated, Śiva, out of compassion, endowed him with a third leg, so that he could complete the circumambu-lation.</p>
			<p>This story though it appears as funny, may symbolically represent the attempts of uniting the Śaiva and the Śākta cults which might have been at loggerheads at one time.</p>
			<p>In iconographical representations Bhṛṅgin is shown as a ṛṣi or a sage with three legs, an emaciated body and a face resembling that of an ape. He is sometimes classed among the bhairavas.</p>

			<p>The topics of puṇya (merit or virtue) and pāpa (demerit or sin) have been dealt with in great detail in the purāṇas and the dharmaśāstras. The origin of these concepts can be found even in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>.</p>
			<p>Pāpas (also called pātakas) or sins have been classified as mahāpātakas (heinous sins) and upapātakas (minor sins). &#x2018;Bhrūṇahatyā&#x2019; is one of the sins included in these lists.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;bhrūṇa&#x2019; has three senses: </p>

				<li>a learned brāhmaṇa;</li>
				<li>a brāhmaṇa who is a Vedic student and</li>
				<li>the foetus or the unborn baby. In all these senses, bhrūṇahatyā has been listed as a heinous sin, with practically no expiation.</li>

		<description>
			<p>Bhūmi or the earth is considered as a &#x2018;loka,&#x2019; a place for doing karma or actions and enjoy their fruits. Hence, it is this earth with all its living beings, that has been designated as &#x2018;bhūloka.&#x2019; It is the first of the three lokas, the other two—higher ones—being bhuvarloka (the mid-region) and svarloka (the heaven). Sometimes, the lokas are enumerated as fourteen, in which case bhūloka is described as situated in the middle, with six lokas above it and seven below.</p>
			<p>The surface of this bhūloka is in the form of a lotus leaf, consisting of seven dvīpas (continents or islands) arranged in the form of concentric circles round the central land mass called the Jambūdvīpa. The other dvīpas are: Plakṣa, Śālmala, Kuśa, Krauñca, Śāka and Puṣkara. All these are surrounded by oceans containing different kinds of liquids like water, milk, curds or cane juice.</p>
			<p>Of these dvīpas, the Jambūdvīpa is considered as more relevant to us since the Bhāratavarṣa (the Indian land mass) is situated in it.</p>

			<p>The Upaniṣads are the main sources of the Vedānta philosophy which has gained a pre-eminent place, in Indian philosophy superseding the other systems.</p>
			<p>One of the most important subjects discussed by the Upaniṣads is Brahman, the Absolute, the origin and substratum of this created universe.</p>
			<p>Out of the several terms used in the Upaniṣads to designate Brahman the word &#x2018;Bhūman&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bhūmā&#x2019; is an uncommon one, used only in the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (7.23-25). Literally, it means &#x2018;that which is very big or great&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Nārada, the well-known sage of the purāṇas, approaches Sanatkumāra, the great teacher of his times, and begs him for instruction regarding the Ātman or the Self, the knowledge of which alone can give freedom from sorrow.</p>
			<p>Sanatkumāra teaches him the techniques of a graded meditation, the objects chosen for the same varying from nāma or name up to prāṇa or the vital energy responsible for life. In this series Bhūmān comes last. When this Bhūman is experienced, one attains supreme joy, compared to which all the pleasures of life pale into insignificance.</p>
			<p>This Bhūman is not only everywhere and in everything, it is also our inner Self. One who realizes this becomes &#x2018;svarāḍ,&#x2019; ruler of his own self. He also attains the freedom to move in all the regions of this universe.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>It is the special characteristic of the ancient Hindu sages to see the hand of the divine—nay, the divinity itself—in every object of creation. Bhū or the earth being our basic abode that supports and sustains us, is naturally looked upon as a goddess, the Mother Divine, a consort of the Supreme Lord Himself.</p>
			<p>According to the Vedas &#x2018;Śrīdevī (Lakṣmī) and Bhūdevī (Earth) are the spouses of Lord Viṣṇu (<em>Puruṣasūkta</em> 24; <em>Taittirīya Saṁhitā</em> 1.5.3.12).</p>
			<p>There are two <em>Bhūsūktas</em> as available now: <em>Atharvaveda Saṁhitā</em> 12.1; <em>Taittirīya Saṁhitā</em> 1.5.3.</p>
			<p>It is the latter sūkta that is more well-known. The first six verses are from the Saṁhitā. The rest (12 verses) are considered khila (addenda), but are also regularly chanted.</p>
			<p>A brief summary of the sūkta may now be given:</p>
			<p>Bhūdevī pervades all the three regions (earth, heaven and sky). She affords an opportunity to the sāttvik jīvās to realise God.</p>
			<p>By circumambulating her, Sūrya (the Sun-god) attained divinity.</p>
			<p>It is through her grace that the Vedas have taken refuge in him (the Sun-god).</p>
			<p>It is again through her grace that the Sun-god has become the life-force (prāṇa) of this world of beings.</p>
			<p>O Agni! Getting angry with you I forsook you! By your grace may I be able to make you burn more brilliantly!</p>
			<p>The anger of the Lord was absorbed by Bhūdevī.</p>
			<p>She is the repository of all the gems. May she bless me with the power of all sense-organs and grant me the light of Brahman.</p>
			<p>She is the support or abode of (God) the Truth. She produces the best of things. She is the support of all the living beings.</p>
			<p>The sea is her garment. The mountains are her breasts.</p>
			<p>She is the consort of Viṣṇu in his incarnation as Yajñavarāha (the Boar). She is the ground for the performance of yajñas or sacrifices. She supports the river (Gaṅgā) that dropped on her from heaven.</p>
			<p>She has the air for her breath and the ocean for her bed. She is specially gracious to the spiritually blind persons.</p>
			<p>I bow down to Bhūdevī who is also known as Mādhavī, dear to Mādhava (Viṣṇu) as his wife and the dear co-wife of Lakṣmī.</p>
			<p>I meditate upon Bhūdevī who is armed with the bow, for attaining all that I want. May she inspire us for the same!</p>
			<p>We offer oblations unto Bhūdevī who is the consort of Viṣṇu, who is free from old age and who is sitting, facing her Lord.</p>
			<p>Viṣṇu of great fame, measured the earth, the heaven and the intervening space in three steps. Bhūdevī, the presiding deity of the star Śravaṇa, takes refuge in him in order to grant name and fame to her dependents.</p>
			<p>May dūrvā (the panic grass), which represents the divine spirit, which is superior to a thousand purifying agencies, which has hundreds of nodes and sprouts and which destroys the effects of evil dreams, remove all my impurities.</p>
			<p>O Bhūdevī, who is traversed by a horse, a chariot and Viṣṇu, I shall keep thee on my head! Protect me at every step! </p>
			<p>O Bhūdevī! You are the giver of happiness like the milch-cow. You sustain life and support all living beings. You yourself were raised by Kṛṣṇa in his incarnation as the Boar (Varāha) having a hundred hands.</p>
			<p>O excellent Bhūdevī! Destroy my evil deeds and sins! Then I can live for a hundred years. Mother Earth! Give me nourishment. In you all are established.</p>
			<p>I invoke the presence here of Śrī, the goddess of prosperity, who is verily Bhūdevī (or the earth) endowed with a peculiar aroma, who is hard to damage, who is ever well-nourished, who has an abundance of cattle and who is the ruler of all beings.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;that which is produced,&#x2019; &#x2018;that which has become&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the more widely used terms in the Indian philosophical systems, the word &#x2018;bhūta&#x2019; refers to the five fundamental ele-ments—pañcabhūtas—viz., pṛthvī (earth), ap (water), tejas (fire), vāyu (air) and ākāśa (ether), the permutations and combi-nations of which result in this physical universe.</p>
			<p>These bhūtas have two aspects, the primary and the secondary. In the primary aspect they are &#x2018;sūkṣmabhūtas&#x2019; or &#x2018;tan-mātras&#x2019;. They arise from the Ātman associated with ajñāna or nescience and are called so since each one of them contains only <em>that</em> quality. For instance, the primordial element ākāśa has only śabda (sound or vibration) as its characteristic and hence is called the &#x2018;śabda-tanmātra&#x2019;. The other primordial elements are: sparśa-tanmātra (vāyu or air), rūpa-tanmātra (agni or fire), rasa-tanmātra (ap or water) and gandha-tanmātra (pṛthvī or earth).</p>
			<p>When these five primordial elements combine among themselves by the process of pañcīkaraṇa or quintuplication (See <ref>PAÑCĪKARAṆA</ref> for details.) they produce the secondary elements, the gross ones, more commonly called the &#x2018;mahābhūtas or sthūlabhūtas&#x2019;. Further creation takes place out of them, associated of course, with the Ātman.</p>
			<p>The word bhūta is also applied to all the living beings as a general term.</p>
			<p>Another meaning of the word is &#x2018;spirits, ghosts and goblins,&#x2019; belief in whose existence was widespread. They are generally malignant, live upon flesh, roam about mostly during the nights and haunt forests, desolate houses and burial or cremation grounds.</p>
			<p>Persons who meet with violent death or commit suicide or for whom no obsequial rites are performed after death, are supposed to become bhūtas or pretas or piśācas (disembodied spirits). Performing such rites or prayers to God by the living, will help them to be liberated from that miserable state.</p>
			<p>The art and science of controlling these spirits and using them for fulfilling one&#x2019;s desires or harming others, called &#x2018;bhūtavidyā&#x2019; has been in existence since Vedic times.</p>
			<p>One of the eight sections of Āyurveda, the science of health and longevity, is also designated as &#x2018;Bhūtavidyā.&#x2019; It deals with the treatment of psychological ailments, believed to be caused by malevolent spirits.</p>

			<p>Bhūtas are grotesque goblins who form part of the army of Rudra-Śiva. Nīlalohita Rudra (one of the aspects of Śiva) is said to have created eleven crores of bhūtas. They are generally pictured as lean figures with elongated ears eager to trouble others. They often fought the asuras or demons siding with the gods.</p>
			<p>Being the lord of these bhūtas, Śiva is often called &#x2018;Bhūtanātha,&#x2019; &#x2018;Bhūteśa&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bhūteśvara&#x2019;. Gaṇapati and Nandikeśvara also are sometimes called by this name.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (200 B.C.) is an accredited work on the philosophy and practise of Yoga. The third chapter of this work designated as <em>Vibhūti-pāda</em> (the section dealing with supernatural powers) gives an account of many yogic powers and the means of attaining them. One such power mentioned there (3.44 and 45) is &#x2018;bhūtajaya.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Bhūtas are the five elements: pṛthvī or earth, ap or water, tejas or fire, vāyu or air and ākāśa or ether. When a yogi practises saṁyama on them, he conquers them.</p>
			<p>Saṁyama is the technical name given to the trio of dhāraṇā (fixing the mind on the object of concentration), dhyāna (meditation) and samādhi (superconscious revelation).</p>
			<p>If saṁyama is achieved on the bhūta pṛthvī or earth, he conquers it. As a result, the solidity of the earth will not be an obstacle to his free movement. Similarly the conquest of the bhūta water gives him immunity against wetness, of fire, immunity against burning and so on.</p>

			<p>Man alone, among all the living beings, has had the privilege of being endowed with the power of speech, with which he can convey his thoughts and feelings to others. However he has even been curious to know whether animals, birds and even worms have their own means of communication. Patañjali (200 B. C.) the ancient teacher of Yoga, asserts in his famous work, the <em>Yogasūtras</em> (3.17), that a yogi <em>can</em> acquire that extraordinary power by practising saṁyama (See <ref>BHŪTAJAYA</ref> for an explanation of this word.) on the three separate aspects of every word.</p>
			<p>This can be illustrated with an example. When a person utters the word &#x2018;cow&#x2019; we get the knowledge of a cow. However, on analysis, we find that three things are involved in this. The word itself is a sound produced by uttering the three letters c, o and w, in succession by the vocal organs. The animal cow is a solid external object perceptible to the eyes and the hands. The knowledge of it produced in the mind is of the form of mental waves. Ordinarily, these three are mixed up and yet, give us a unitive experience.</p>
			<p>If the yogi can manage to separate these three in his mind and practise saṁyama on each of them separately, then, he realizes the basic truths underlying each of them, viz., śabda (sound), artha (object signified) and pratyaya (knowledge in the form of mental waves). This will now empower him to &#x2018;know&#x2019; the meaning of all the sounds uttered by all the living beings including those of the animal kingdom.</p>
			<p>Purāṇas sometimes mention the names of persons who had acquired this power.</p>

			<p>Pūjā or worship of a deity, whether in a temple or at home, is an elaborate ritual. This pūjā can be based either on the Vedic traditions or on the tāntric.</p>
			<p>One of the preliminary processes in a tāntric pūjā is &#x2018;bhūtaśuddhi&#x2019; or purification of the elements, making up the body of the worshipper.</p>
			<p>The worshipper has to raise his own self, the jīvātman, first to the feet of the Lord (Paramaśiva or Paramātman) dwelling in the sahasrāra or thousand petalled lotus in the head. Then, uttering the mantra <em>yaṁ</em>, has to imagine that the dross in his body has dried up. This should be followed by the burning up this dross through the mantra <em>raṁ</em>. The drossless body is then to be bathed in ambrosia, uttering the mantra <em>vaṁ</em> and completely regenerated by the mantra <em>laṁ</em>. This purified and regenerated body is now fit to worship the Lord.</p>
			<p>This whole process is called &#x2018;bhūtaśuddhi.&#x2019;</p>

			<p>Works on Āyurveda (science of health and longevity) generally deal with eight subjects, one of which is &#x2018;bhūtavidyā.&#x2019; It is the ancient equivalent of the modern psychiatry. Mental disorders, it was believed, were caused by bhūtas or malevolent spirits. The remedies recommended were prayers, oblations, exorcism as also some drugs.</p>

			<p>Bhūtavidyā is one of the nineteen branches of Knowledge (vidyās) mentioned in the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (7.1.2). It is, perhaps, the science and art of involving, inviting or controlling the goblins and disembodied spirits.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Hindu scriptures emphasize that man is essentially a social being. He is born in this world with ṛṇatraya or three debts on his head, to discharge which, he has to perform pañcayajñas or the five daily sacrifices. These pañcayajñas are a compulsory part of a householder&#x2019;s life.</p>
			<p>The last of these five daily sacrifices is bhūtayajña. Bhūtas are living beings, especially the animals. Feeding the animals, both the domestic and the stray, according to one&#x2019;s capacity comprises this yajña. Since the Lord is the indwelling spirit of all the living beings, feeding the hungry souls—whether the human beings or the animals—will please him. This is one of the best ways to discharge one&#x2019;s debts. It will also contribute to the awareness that ultimately the whole universe is one and that we are part of that oneness.</p>

			<p>Whether the world that we see here and now is the only one with living beings or whether other such regions also exist elsewhere, has always been a matter of inquisitiveness for man. The Hindu purāṇas have given accounts of such bhuvanas or lokas or worlds, though the number of such worlds vary from one description to another.</p>
			<p>Mostly it is three worlds that are mentioned, even in the Vedas: Bhūloka, Antarikṣa or Bhuvarloka and Svarloka or Svargaloka. If human beings inhabit Bhūloka, the munis (sages) live in the Bhuvarloka whereas the devas (gods) live in Svarloka or heaven.</p>
			<p>Sometimes names of other lokas such as Pitṛloka (the world of manes), Vāyuloka (the world of windgod) or Saptarṣiloka (the world of the Seven Sages) are also found mentioned in the purāṇas.</p>
			<p>Quite often, there is a reference to caturdaśabhuvana or fourteen worlds. They are: Bhūloka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and Satya-loka or Brahmaloka.</p>
			<p>The six lokas above the Bhūloka are sometimes collectively called &#x2018;Ūrdhva-lokas,&#x2019; since they are above this earth.</p>
			<p>The other seven lokas, (making up a total of fourteen), and below the earth, called the &#x2018;Adholokas&#x2019; or even as &#x2018;Pātālas&#x2019; are: Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talātala, Mahātala, Rasātala and Pātāla.</p>
			<p>The denizens of the Ūrdhvalokas are the beings at various stages of higher spiritual evolution. Sinners of various categories inhabit the lower worlds until their sins are exhausted by suffering.</p>
			<p>All, except those in this Satyaloka or the Brahmaloka, have to return to this earth for further evolution up to mokṣa or liberation.</p>
			<p>See <em>Vyāsabhāṣya</em> on the <em>Yogasūtras</em> (3.26) of Patañjali, for further details.</p>

			<p>Acquisition of supernatural powers has always fascinated man right from the beginning of human history. Some have struggled to get them through witchcraft or sorcery or demonological rites, to harm or control others through selfish or evil motives. Others however, while practising spiritual disciplines to purify themselves have attained these powers as a matter of course, as a part of that evolutionary process.</p>
			<p>The aṣṭāṅgayoga—eightlimbed yoga leading to samādhi or superconscious experience—of Patañjali (200 B. C.) has, incidentally mentioned several such powers that a yogi develops as a result of practising &#x2018;saṁyama&#x2019; on various objects. (See <ref>BHŪTAJAYA</ref> for an explanation of the word &#x2018;saṁyama.&#x2019;)</p>
			<p>If saṁyama is practised on sūrya or the sun, the yogi will attain a detailed knowledge of all the fourteen worlds. This is &#x2018;bhuvanajñāna.&#x2019;</p>

		<description>
			<p>Bhuvaneswar, the modern capital of the State of Orissa (India), is an ancient place of pilgrimage called &#x2018;Bhuvaneśvara&#x2019; or &#x2018;Ekāmratīrtha&#x2019; in the purāṇas. It is situated in the Khurda subdivision of the Puri district and is 440 kms. (286 miles) from the city of Calcutta.</p>
			<p>It was a great centre of Śaivism in the Kaliṅgadeśa (now Orissa) and was often considered as a rival of Vārāṇasī (the modern Banaras, the most celebrated of all the Śaiva places of pilgrimage). It was also a centre of Buddhism for some time, the remnants of which can be found even now in the hills of Udayagiri and Khaṇḍagiri.</p>
			<p>Known as the city of seven thousand shrines, mostly surrounding the famous Bindusāgara or Gosāgara lake, it now has hardly a hundred.</p>
			<p>Though the city of Purī (better known as Jagannātha Purī or Jagannātha-kṣetra) is now much more well-known and resorted to, the tradition is that one who wishes to visit the latter must first make a pilgrimage to the former. Even Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya (A. D. 1485-1533) the great Vaiṣṇava saint, is said to have had the darśan of Lord Liṅgarāja of Bhuvaneśvara first before proceeding to Purī.</p>
			<p>A pilgrimage to Bhuvaneswar starts with a ceremonial bath and śrāddha (obsequial offerings to the departed manes) at the Bindusāgar, a lake measuring 420 by 330 metres (1400 ft. by 1100 ft.). It is believed to have been dug out by Lord Śiva himself to quench the thirst of Pārvatī, his consort, a little water from all the sacred rivers being drawn into it.</p>
			<p>After worshipping Gaṇapati, Gopālinī (Pārvatī as a cowherdess), Skanda and Nandi in the nearby shrines, the pilgrim is advised to enter the temple of Liṅgarāja to offer his worship there.</p>
			<p>The great Liṅgarāja temple was built around A. D. 1000. It is acclaimed as the finest example of a Hindu temple, of the Nāgara style, in eastern India. It stands amidst a cluster of 65 smaller shrines in a spacious compound measuring about 160 by 140 metres (530 ft. by 460 ft.), the tower being nearly 55 metres (180 ft.) high.</p>
			<p>The temple consists of the garbha-mandir, the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>, also called &#x2018;Śrīmandir&#x2019; with a hollow vimāna (small tower) over it. The image of Śiva is a liṅga which is a huge uncarved block of granite, about 2.4 metres (8 ft.) in diameter surrounded by a rim of black chloride. The image itself is called as &#x2018;Liṅgarāja,&#x2019; &#x2018;Tribhuvaneśvara&#x2019; or &#x2018;Kṛtti-vāsa&#x2019;. Daily worship is done 22 times, water, milk and bhāṅg (Indian hemp) being used to bathe the liṅga.</p>
			<p>The Bindusāgara is situated to the north of the temple.</p>
			<p>Other temples situated in the vicinity are those of Ananta-Vāsudeva, Rāja-Rāṇi, Mukteśvara, Paraśurāmeśvara, Siddhe-śvara and Kedāreśvara. Out of these, the Mukteśvara temple, though small, is considered to be very beautiful with elaborate carvings.</p>
			<p>Situated at a distance of about 5 kms. (3 miles) from Bhuvaneswar, are the hills—Udayagiri, Khaṇḍagiri and Nīlagiri—containing as many as 66 caves. There are many carvings in them, both Hindu and Buddhist.</p>

		<description>
			<p>If the fatherhood of God is accepted, why not motherhood too? Hindu religious scriptures have often projected the śakti or the divine power of God, as the female consort.</p>
			<p>God creates this universe (sṛṣṭi), sustains it for one cycle of creation (sthiti) and then destroys it or withdraws it (laya or pralaya) into himself. These three aspects of God are sometimes pictured as three different deities—Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara or Śiva—with their consorts Sarasvatī, Lakṣmī and Pārvatī.</p>
			<p>Pārvatī, also called Śakti, forms the basis of the Śākta cult and has innumerable emanations or manifestations, widely worshipped all over India.</p>
			<p>One such celebrated aspect, quite commonly worshipped, is Bhuvaneśvarī or &#x2018;Mistress of the universe&#x2019;. She is worshipped not only in the Devī temples but also in one&#x2019;s own home.</p>
			<p>She is sometimes classed among the Daśamahāvidyās, ten aspects of transcendental knowledge and power. (See <ref>DAŚA-MAHĀVIDYĀS</ref>.) She is the ruler over the caturdaśabhuvanas or the fourteen worlds from Brahmaloka to Pātāla; hence the name Bhuvaneśvarī. She is the presiding deity over all the forces of the material world, which can be obtained by propitiating her.</p>
			<p>Iconographically, she is represented as of the colour of the rising sun. Extraordinarily beautiful, she is seated on a lotus seat, has three eyes and four arms, and is bedecked with an array of ornaments. A crescent moon adorns her crown. She is holding a pāśa (noose) and an aṅkuśa (goad) in two hands, the other two hands exhibiting the varada (boon-giving) and abhaya (protection) mudrās.</p>

			<p>Out of the ten avatāras (known as Daśāvatāras) or incarnations of Viṣṇu, the Varāha (Boar-incarnation) is the third. Viṣṇu assumed this form to recover bhū or the earth—deified as Bhūdevī or Earth-goddess—sunk in the waters of the ocean by the demon Hiraṇyākṣa.</p>
			<p>He is generally shown as lifting up and holding Bhūdevī in his right hand. The goddess herself is shown as a charming damsel of dark complexion (or bright like lightning) with folded hands.</p>
			<p>Bhūvarāha is sometimes distinguished from Ādivarāha, the latter being shown as standing on the Ādiśeṣa (Serpent-Conch Viṣṇu) whereas the former is not. Occasionally the two forms are shown as identical.</p>

			<p>Though the word means the seed of any plant or a tree, it has been used in a more fundamental sense as the origin or the cause of anything. As the cause of life it means the semen of living beings. As the cause of saṁsāra or transmigratory existence, it represents avidyā or ajñāna (nescience). In dramaturgy it stands for a root-cause out of which the whole play ultimately evolves. In Haṭhayoga, it is a kind of mudrā or pose of hand and figures with a mystic significance (Bījamudrā). As part of mantras, it is the most important letter or letters, the recitation of which leads to desired results.</p>

			<p>The use of mantras or mystic syllables or formulae, as an aid to upāsanā or meditation is wide-spread in Hinduism. Though Brahman, the ultimate Truth or the Absolute is one and one only, its manifestations however, can be innume-rable. As is declared in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (4.11; 7.21) God responds to the prayers of his devotees in and through any form the devotee chooses. Over the millennia, the ṛṣis of the Vedas, the purāṇas and the tantras (secondary scriptures) of the various cults have given us a large number of deities, both male and female, for our upāsanā and spiritual upliftment. If it is remembered that all these deities, though with different names and forms, are, all the same, the various manifestations of that God—like the chocolate dolls being chocolate only and hence all tasting sweet—there can be no confusion or conflict in the minds of the votaries.</p>
			<p>Every deity has a tantra or a philo-sophy and associated rituals, a yantra or a geometrical form and a mantra or a sound-form. The physical form of the deity is described in its dhyānaśloka (hymn of meditation) which is of great help in actual meditation.</p>
			<p>The mantras are of various types, the most common form being the one having three or four parts: praṇava or Oṁ, the bījākṣara or the bījāmantra, the name of the deity in the caturthī-vibhakti or dative case and the word namaḥ indicating obeisance. For eg., consider the well-known mantra of Śiva—<em>Oṁ namaś-śivāya</em>, (&#x2018;Om, obeisance to Śiva!&#x2019;) Here, of course, the bījākṣara, the seed-letter, is missing.</p>
			<p>The bījamantra, which is generally monosyllabic and hence called &#x2018;bijākṣara&#x2019; (akṣara = letter) also, is, as its very name indicates, a &#x2018;seed-formula,&#x2019; containing the essence of the deity in itself. This will gradually get evolved by an assiduous practice of its repetition with faith and devotion, even as the tree evolves out of its seed by proper cultivation. Hence the aptness of the term &#x2018;bīja&#x2019; to it.</p>
			<p>Every deity, even the different aspects of the same deity, have different bījamantras which are kept a secret, to be handed down in the oral tradition from the guru to the disciple at the time of dīkṣā or initiation into spiritual life.</p>
			<p>Some of the more common bīja-mantras are: hauṁ (for Śiva), duṁ (for Durgā), krīṁ (for Kālī), śrīṁ (for Lakṣmī) aiṁ (for Sarasvatī), klīṁ (for Kāmadeva or Kṛṣṇa), gaṁ (for Gaṇapati) and so on.</p>
			<p>The readers of the tāntric works are however warned not to practise their repetition unless it is ceremonially received from a qualified guru.</p>

			<p>The bilva tree (<em>Aegle marmelos</em>), commonly called as the <em>bel</em> tree or the wood-apple tree, has long been considered as very sacred. Known as Śrīphala or Śrīvṛkṣa in the Sanskrit works, it is said to be dear to Śiva, whose vegetal form it is supposed to be, to Pārvatī or Śakti and to Śrī or Lakṣmī. Worship to this tree is an integral part of the elaborate Durgāpūjā ritual.</p>
			<p>Its leaves are invariably used in the worship of Śiva and Śakti. Amulets prepared out of these leaves are believed to be endowed with supernatural powers.</p>
			<p>Medicines prepared out of the unripe fruit are credited with very effective powers of cure.</p>
			<p>A pledge taken over the bilva leaf is considered too sacred to be broken.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Bilva&#x2019; is also the name of one of the mudrās or poses of hand and fingers, generally used in the worship of Viṣṇu.</p>

		<description>
			<p>According to the Śākta-tantras, scriptures of the cult of the Divine Mother, the ultimate Reality is one, a transcendental Absolute. It is immutable and ineffable. It is pictured as prakāśa, supreme effulgence. Desiring to become many, this Absolute starts reflecting on itself. This deliberation is technically designated as &#x2018;vimarśa&#x2019;. This vimarśa creates a throb or stir, spanda, which develops as vibration or nāda, and gets concentrated to a point or bindu. This bindu, like a dicotyledonous seed, contains the Śiva-Śakti principle as one closely knit unit. It then gradually evolves into this universe.</p>
			<p>Anusvāra, the dot placed above the letters of the Sanskrit alphabets, indicating the nasal sound, is also called &#x2018;bindu&#x2019;. It is an invariable part of the bījamantras and is said to impart an additional meaning of dispelling sorrow.</p>
			<p>In the works on yoga, bindu stands for the ājñācakra, the psychic centre between the eyebrows.</p>

			<p>Taking bath in sacred rivers has been considered as a highly meritorious act since the ancient days. The Gaṅgā at Vārāṇasī (Banaras) is one such sacred river. On the banks of this sacred river, several bathing places have been provided, with steps leading from the bank right up to the water. They are called &#x2018;ghāṭs&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The Pañcagaṅgā-ghāṭ is one of the five ghāṭs. Here, four rivers—Kiraṇā, Sarasvatī, Yamunā and Dhūtapāpā—are believed to join the Gaṅgā in their subtle forms, unseen by the naked eye. Hence the name Pañcagaṅgā or five Gaṅgās or sacred rivers.</p>
			<p>One of the temples situated at this ghāṭ is a small Viṣṇu temple, without the śikhara or tower. A small image of dark colour is established on a large siṁhāsana or throne. The deity is called Bindu-mādhava.</p>
			<p>The story goes that once Lord Viṣṇu visited Vārāṇāsī and sat down at the Pañcagaṅgā-ghāṭ since he liked it much. A brāhmaṇa, Agnibindu by name, who was practising severe austerities there, recognized the Lord and prayed to him with a long devotional hymn. Pleased with it, the Lord granted his wish which was twofold. The Lord had to stay there permanently and his image should be known as Bindu-mādhava, thus perpetuating the name of the brāhmaṇa. The sacred water of the river at this ghāṭ came to be known as Bindutīrtha.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Places associated with gods or saints or saintly kings or other holy persons have been the favourite pilgrim resorts of the Hindus over the centuries. One of the less known places of pilgrimage is the lake Bindusaras, also known as the Bindu-sarovara.</p>
			<p>The <em>Mahābhārata</em> (<em>Bhīṣmaparva</em> 6.43-46) describes a Bindusaras as situated between the mountains Maināka and Hiraṇyaśṛṅga. It is here that the king Bhagīratha practised severe austerities to bring the river Gaṅgā from the world of gods to the world of men. The place, even now known by the same name, is situated near Gaṅgotri (birthplace of the river Gaṅgā) about 3 kms. (2 miles) to the south. A small temple dedicated to the river goddess Gaṅgā stands at the place where Bhagīratha is said to have practised austerities.</p>
			<p>When the river goddess Gaṅgā acceded to Bhagīratha&#x2019;s request to descend to this earth, Śiva arrested her ferocious flow with his matted hair and then let the water out in drops which formed this Bindusaras (bindu = drop). The river Gaṅgā then emerged out of this in seven streams.</p>
			<p>The lake Kapālamocana-tīrtha at Vārāṇasī or Kāśī (modern Banaras), where Śiva is said to have bathed and got rid off the sin of decapitating one of the five original heads of Brahmā, is also sometimes called Bindusaras.</p>
			<p>The <em>Brahmapurāṇa</em> (41.52-54) des-cribes one Bindusaras created by Rudra (Śiva) by collecting drops of water from all the holy places and filling the lake with that. It is said to be situated in the Ekāmraka-kṣetra.</p>
			<p>Two big tanks—one at Siddhapura near Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and another at Bhuvaneśvara (Orissa)—also go by the same name.</p>

			<p>Durgāpūjā, worship of the Divine Mother Durgā, celebrated for nine days or for three days, during the month of Āśvayuja or Āśvina (September/October), is a major festival of the Hindus.</p>
			<p>According to Hindu mythology, the various gods and goddesses go to sleep for a period of four months (from Āṣāḍha to Kārttīka, July to October). Since the Durgāpūjā is celebrated in the month of Āśvina when Durgā is still asleep, she has to be woken up first. This ceremonial waking up of the deity is called &#x2018;bodhana.&#x2019; It is done on the evening of Āśvina śukla ṣaṣṭhī, (sixth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Āśvina). A ghaṭa or kalaśa (a pot with water containing sandalwood paste, dūrvā grass, leaves of five trees like mango, clay from seven places, fruit etc.) is established under a bilva tree (<em>Aegle marmelos</em>), the mantras of bodhana or awakening are uttered, and the bilva tree itself is worshipped as the Mother Durgā.</p>
			<p>The story goes that when Durgā (Pārvatī, the spouse of Śiva) came to her mother&#x2019;s house from her husband&#x2019;s home, it was late in the evening. So, she decided not to disturb her parents and spent the whole night under a bilva tree near the house. The ritual described above, is symbolic of this.</p>
			<p>Bodhana is also one of the ten aspects of a ritual aimed at making a mantra (divine formula) potent. See <ref>MANTRA-SAṀSKĀRA</ref> for details.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Vedānta-darśana, one of the six systems of Indian philosophy, is based mainly on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, which again, is a work that systematizes the philosophical ideas occurring in the Upaniṣads.</p>
			<p>Rāmānuja (A.D. 1107-1137) wrote an admirable commentary—the <em>Śrībhāṣya</em>—on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> according to the Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy and Vaiṣṇava religion. He is said to have acquired a copy of the <em>Vṛtti</em> (gloss) on the <em>Brahma-sūtras</em> written by an ancient teacher Bodhāyana, which was quite voluminous and which he (Rāmānuja) had faithfully followed while composing the <em>Śrībhāṣya</em>. Who this Bodhāyana was, is not known; nor is his work available. He is sometimes identified with Upavarṣa (also called Vṛttikāra), who again, had been known as Kṛtakoṭi and Halabhūti also. He is said to have written a vṛtti on the <em>Pūrvamīmāṁsā-sūtras</em> also. However none of these has been universally accepted by the scholars in these fields. It is generally conceded that Bodhāyana was, historically speaking, the founder of Vaiṣṇava schools of philosophy.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bodh-gayā or Buddha-gayā is one of the most holy places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists. It is here that the prince Siddhārtha Gautama attained &#x2018;bodhi&#x2019; or spiritual enlightenment and became the Buddha.</p>
			<p>This place is situated at a distance of ten kilometers (6.5 miles) from Gayā, the well-known place of Hindu pilgrimage. The chief attractions of this place are the peepul tree (Bodhi tree) (See <ref>BODHIVṚKṢA</ref> for details.) and the Buddha temple. The temple is 15 metres (50 ft.) square and the total height is 48 metres (160 ft.). There is a beautiful image of Buddha as also of Māyādevī (Buddha&#x2019;s mother). Though tradition ascribes the building of this temple to Aśoka (272-232 B. C.), the present one may have been built after the 7th century A.D. and altered several times. The existing one may have been a rebuilt structure of the 19th century.</p>
			<p>An edict of Aśoka is found in a cave nearby. The Buddhist Vihāra he is said to have built does not exist now, though its remnants are found here and there near the Bodhi tree.</p>
			<p>Hiuen Tsang (7th cent. A. D.) had visited this place and has left a nice description of the same.</p>

			<p>Prince Siddhārtha Gautama became Gautama the &#x2018;Buddha&#x2019; (&#x2018;the Enlightened One&#x2019;) after attaining &#x2018;bodhi&#x2019; or enlightenment. The particular peepul tree(aśvattha-vṛkṣa—<em>Ficus religiosa</em>) under which he attained this bodhi, situated at Gayā (now known as Bodh-gayā or Buddha Gayā), is called the Bodhivṛkṣa. There is a stone slab under it, &#x2018;Vajrāsana&#x2019; by name, sitting on which Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment.</p>
			<p>The present tree may be about a hundred years old.</p>
			<p>The original tree is believed to have sprung up spontaneously on the same day that Buddha was born. Hence it was called &#x2018;sahajāta.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The extant tree is an offshoot of the older ones, sprouted out of their roots over centuries. Apart from the emperor Aśoka, king Śaśāṅka (7th cent. A. D.) is reported to have done the replanting. The latest one may have been done in 1876.</p>
			<p>A branch of this tree was taken to Anūrādhapura (in Sri Lanka) and planted there by Saṅghamittā-therī (a Buddhist nun, daughter of emperor Aśoka).</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The extreme popularity and importance of the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> gave rise, in course of time, to a number of religio-philosophical tracts of varying lengths composed in verse form to which the title &#x2018;Gītā&#x2019; was appended. The <em>Mahābhārata</em> alone contains sixteen of them, and the <em>Bodhyagītā</em> is one such.</p>
			<p>It is a short piece of only ten verses (<em>Śāntiparva</em> 178.3-13) and contains the teaching given by the sage Bodhya to the king Yayāti.</p>
			<p>The sage declares that he learnt great lessons in his life by observing the following persons and animals during the course of his wanderings as a mendicant: a prostitute called Piṅgalā, the bird kurara or osprey, a serpent, the legendary cātaka bird (<em>Cucculus melanolecucus</em>) that lives on rain drops, a blacksmith who prepared arrows and an unmarried girl.</p>
			<p>From Pīṅgalā he learnt the spirit of renunciation; from the osprey, that attachment leads to misery; from the serpent that one should be homeless; from the cātaka bird that one should live on alms without being a burden to anyone; from the blacksmith, concentration of mind; and, from the unmarried girl, that one should live all alone to avoid quarrels and misunderstandings.</p>
			<p>This <em>Gītā</em> seems to be a summary of the story of the Avadhūta with 24 teachers in the <em>Bhāgavata </em>(11.7-9).</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Sanskrit language has a long history and a rich heritage. One of the innumerable writers who have contributed to its grammar and literature is Bopadeva (also spelt as Vopadeva or Hopadeva). He was the son of Keśava and a disciple of Dhaneśa. He lived in Berar, in the 13th century.</p>
			<p>He adorned the court of the king Mahādeva of Devagiri as the chief poet. The works attributed to him are: <em>Muktāphala, Harilīlāvivaraṇa, Śataślokī, Mugdhabodha</em> and <em>Kavikalpadruma</em>.</p>
			<p><em>Mugdhabodha</em> is an extremely popular primer of Sanskrit grammar. <em>Kavikalpa-druma</em> deals with the dhātus or verbal roots.</p>
			<p>The authorship of the most popular purāṇa, the <em>Bhāgavata</em>, is sometimes attri-buted to him, though available evidence seems to weigh heavily against this theory.</p>

			<word>Brahmā</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Broadly speaking, Hindus can be divided into three main groups: Śaivas or those who worship Śiva, Śāktas or those who worship Śakti (consort of Śiva) and Vaiṣṇavas or those who worship Viṣṇu. However, popular Hindu theology, which has its roots in the ancient scriptures, adds another important deity, Brahmā. The three—Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva—together form the Hindu Trinity.</p>
			<p>Brahmā creates the world, Viṣṇu sustains it and Śiva destroys it. This process of creation (sṛṣṭi), preservation (sthiti) and destruction (pralaya) continues perpetually in that order.</p>
			<p>Thus Brahmā is the source, the seed, of all that is. He is, as his very name indicates, boundless immensity, from which space, time and causation originate, names and forms spring up. Philosophically, he is the first stage of manifestation of the notion of individual existence (ahaṅkāra). Theologically, he is the uncreated Creator (Svayambhū), the self-born first Person.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>He has several designations which are as instructive as they are interesting. From the cosmological point of view, he is the Golden Embryo (Hiraṇyagarbha), the ball of fire, from which the universe develops. Since all created beings are his progeny, he is Prajāpati, the Lord of progeny, as also the Pitāmaha, the Patriarch. He is Vidhi, the ordinator, Lokeśa, the master of the worlds, as well as Dhātṛ, the sustainer. He is also Viśvakarmā, the architect of the world.</p>
			<p>Hindu mythological literature des-cribes Brahmā as having sprung from the lotus originating from the navel of Viṣṇu. Hence he is called Nābhija (the navel-born), Kañja (waterborn) and so on.</p>
			<p>Curiously enough, the name &#x2018;Nārā-yaṇa&#x2019; (&#x2018;the one who dwells in the casual waters&#x2019; or &#x2018;the abode of man&#x2019;) has been applied to him first and later only to Viṣṇu.</p>
			<p>Brahmā, the creator and Sarasvatī, his consort, are the subjects of several tales in our mythological literature. They can be summarised briefly thus:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Brahmā was born out of the golden egg produced in the boundless causal waters. His consort Vāc or Sarasvatī was manifested out of him. From their union were born all the creatures of the world.</li>
				<li>Brahmā represents the Vedas and Sarasvatī, their spirit and meaning. Hence all knowledge, sacred and secular, has proceeded from them.</li>
				<li>Once Brahmā became the boar and raised the earth from beneath the waters and created the world, the sages and Prajāpati.</li>
				<li>The forms of tortoise and fish, (later considered as avatāras of Viṣṇu) have been attributed to Brahmā also.</li>
				<li>The great sages Marīci, Atri, Aṅgiras and others are his &#x2018;mind-born&#x2019; children. Manu, the Adam of the Āryan race, is his great-grandson.</li>
				<li> He is easily pleased with auster-ities and bestows boons on the supplicants, be they gods, demons or human beings.</li>
				<li>He is the inventor of the theatrical art. Music, dance and stagecraft were revealed by him.</li>
				<li>He was the chief priest who per-formed the marriage of Pārvatī with Śiva.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In spite of the fact that Brahmā is God the Supreme in the creative aspect and is an equally important member of the Hindu Trinity, it is strange that there are no temples dedicated exclusively to him, the one at Puṣkar (near Ajmer in Rajasthan) being the solitary exception. Notwithstanding the crude reasons given in some of the purāṇas for the loss of Brahmā&#x2019;s prestige, it is likely that the Brahmā cult was predominant in the pre-Vedic Hinduism and was superseded by the later Śiva-Viṣṇu cults. In fact, the evolution of the Śakti concept—each of the gods Śiva and Viṣṇu having his Śakti or Power as his consort—and the explanation that creation proceeds from the combination of the God and his Śakti, has made Brahmā superfluous.</p>
			<p>The icon of Brahmā has four heads facing the four quarters, and they represent the four Vedas, the four yugas (epochs of time), and the four varṇas (divisions of society based on nature, nurture and vocation). Usually the faces have beards and the eyes are closed in mediation. There are four arms holding different objects and in different poses. The arms represent the four quarters. The objects usually shown are: akṣamālā (rosary), kūrca (a brush of kuśa grass), sruk (ladle), sruva (spoon), kamaṇḍalu (waterpot) and pustaka (book). The combination and arrangement vary from image to image.</p>
			<p>The rosary represents time and the waterpot, the causal waters, from which all creation has sprung up. So, Brahmā controls time as well as the principle of causation. The kuśa grass, the ladle and the spoon being sacrificial implements, represent the system of sacrifices which is the means to be adopted by the various creatures to sustain one another. The book stands for knowledge, sacred and secular. He is the giver of all knowledge—arts, sciences and wisdom.</p>
			<p>The mudrās or poses of the hand are abhaya (assuring protection) and varada (granting boons).</p>
			<p>The icon may be either in the standing posture (standing on a lotus) or in the sitting posture (sitting on a haṁsa or swan). Haṁsa or the swan stands for discrimination and wisdom.</p>
			<p>In the temples dedicated exclusively to Brahmā, his aspect as Viśvakarma (the architect of the universe) is adopted. In this form he is shown as having four heads, four arms holding the rosary, the book, the kuśa grass and the kamaṇḍalu and riding on his swan.</p>
			<p>Every temple, be it of Śiva or Viṣṇu, must have a niche in the northern wall for Brahmā, and his icon must receive worship everyday since he is an important parivāradevatā (attendant of the Chief deity).</p>
			<p>Brahmā is also the name applied to one of the four principal priests in a Vedic sacrifice. He is the most learned of all and is required to know the three Vedas for his professional duties. He acts as a presiding officer of a sacrifice and is silent most of the time. He instructs the adhvaryu priest when his advice is sought for. It is he who prescribes the prāyaścittas (expiatory rites) when mistakes are committed in a sacrifice.</p>
			<p>In later Vedic literature, he came to be associated with the <em>Atharvaveda</em>.</p>

			<p>In the literature connected with Hindu temples, this word is used in two senses. Firstly, it represents the central part of the plot or the site of the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>, the outer ones being respectively called daiva, mānuṣa and paiśāca bhāgas (parts pertaining to the gods, human beings and goblins).</p>
			<p>Secondly, it refers to the lowest part of the Śivaliṅga made of stone, which is square in shape and is embedded in the earth. The middle part which is octagonal and is embedded in the pedestal is called Viṣṇubhāga. The cylindrical part projecting outside the pedestal is called Rudrabhāga. It is also called as Pūjābhāga since pūjā or worship is offered only to this part.</p>

			<word>brahmacarya</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;conduct pertaining to Brahman&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the words used extensively in the Hindu religious literature is the word &#x2018;brahmacarya.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Etymologically speaking, the word can mean two things: &#x2018;Movement (caryā) in Brahman.&#x2019; &#x2018;Code of conduct (caryā) (to be observed during the period of studying the) Vedas (Brahman).&#x2019;</p>
			<p>When a Vedic student was learning the Vedas in the house of his preceptor, he had to lead a very strict life, wherein celibacy or continence was the most important discipline. Hence the word &#x2018;brahmacarya&#x2019; is, more commonly, interpreted as celibacy.</p>
			<p>Celibacy centres round the control and the ultimate sublimation of the sexual instinct. Sex, again, is an instinct of the body. Hence, the best solution to the problems created by the sex-instinct is transcending the body-consciousness itself and rising to the soul-consciousness. This becomes possible only when the mind dwells constantly on Brahman, the Absolute, to such an extent that the body is forgotten. Hence the very first meaning given is, perhaps, more accurate and includes the latter too.</p>
			<p>Of the four stages of life, technically called the &#x2018;āśramas,&#x2019; the first is known as the &#x2018;brahmacaryāśrama&#x2019; or just &#x2018;brahmacarya;&#x2019; and the student undergoing it is called a &#x2018;brahmacārin&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>A brahmacārin entered the gurukula or the house of the preceptor for studying the Vedas as also other sciences, after undergoing the sacrament of upanayana. The period of this brahmacarya was usually twelve years, though it could be more.</p>
			<p>The following are some of the rules and discipline that a brahmacārin was expected to observe: strict celibacy, speaking the truth, gentleness in speech, physical austerities like cold water bath, eating sparingly at night and service to the preceptor, devotion to study and contemplation.</p>
			<p>He was to beg his food and could partake of it only after offering it to the preceptor.</p>
			<p>Though brahmacarya or celibacy was obligatory for the brahmacārins and the saṁnyāsins (monks), even the householders were advised to observe it as best as they could.</p>

		<description>
			<p>All the schools of Vedānta posit Brahman, the Absolute, as the primary reality. However, it is the Advaita Vedānta school of Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) that considers Brahman, not just the primary reality, but as the <em>only</em> reality and that it is &#x2018;advaita,&#x2019; &#x2018;the one without a second&#x2019;. This proposition seems to have been put forward not only as the most essential teaching of the Upaniṣads, but also to counter the <em>Śabdādvaita-vāda</em> of the grammar schools which propounded that &#x2018;Śabda&#x2019; or the &#x2018;Word&#x2019; was the sole origin of the universe.</p>

			<p>The <em>Mahābhārata</em>, considered as the &#x2018;Pañcama-veda&#x2019; or the fifth Veda, has enriched human life as also itself by bequeathing the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> to the posterity. However, the same epic also contains several other pieces of religious discourses, each one of them with a different name, but with word &#x2018;gītā&#x2019; affixed to it. Of the sixteen such gītās, the <em>Brahmagītā</em> also is one. It comprises just nine verses, from the 4th to 12th verse, in chapter 35 of the <em>Anuśāsanaparva.</em></p>
			<p>In the course of his long discourse to Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava princes, Bhīṣma, the grandsire, narrates how in the beginning of this cycle of creation Brahmā, the Creator, brought forth the four varṇas or classes of human beings—the brāhmaṇas, the kṣattriyas, the vaiśyas and the śūdras—and taught them wisdom.</p>
			<p>The brāhmaṇas were advised to live a life of self-control, to study the Vedas with devotion, to offer sacrifices to the gods in heaven and not to hurt any being. They could get whatever they wanted, just by tapas (austerity) and jñāna (know-ledge). He also exhorted them to never stoop to performing the works meant for the śūdras. That would degrade them spiritually.</p>
			<p>Since dharma was preserved by such brāhmaṇas, he counselled the other three classes to protect and serve the brāhmaṇas.</p>
			<p>Because this teaching was delivered by Brahmā, it has been named as the <em>Brahmagītā</em>.</p>
			<p>There is a<em> Brahmagītā</em> in the <em>Sūtasaṁhitā</em> which itself is a part of the <em>Skāndapurāṇa</em>. See <ref>SŪTASAṀHITĀ</ref> for details.</p>

			<p>Brahmagupta was a pioneer in the field of mathematics and astronomy. He was born during A. D. 598 in Bhinmal in the Jalore district of Rajasthan. His principal works are <em>Brāhmasphuṭa Siddhānta</em> and <em>Khaṇḍakhādyakaraṇa</em>. The former, composed in A. D. 628, has been commented upon by Caturveda Pṛthūdaka Svāmin (A. D. 860), in detail, probably following the tradition of the original author.</p>
			<p>As a mathematician, Brahmagupta is famous for his work on cakrīyacaturbhuja or cyclic quadrilaterals. His astronomical writings were well-known in Western India even by A. D. 712.</p>
			<p>The length of the year as determined by him is slightly less than what is accepted by most of the astronomical texts.</p>
			<p>Bhāskarācārya (A. D. 1114-1160), the celebrated astronomer, has described Brahmagupta as Gaṇakacakracūḍāmaṇi (the crest-jewel among mathematicians).</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the slaying of a brāhmaṇa&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Though man is essentially divine in nature, he is prone to vice and committing crimes, thus incurring pātaka or pāpa or sin. This is mainly due to the evil tendencies carried over from the past lives.</p>
			<p>Etymologically, the word pāpa (sin) is defined as &#x2018;that from which one has to protect oneself&#x2019;. It arises first in the mind as the tendency towards vice and manifests itself either in neglecting the prescribed duties or in committing prohibited actions. The scriptures are the primary, if not the sole, authority in this field.</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras—the works that deal with the religio-social life of the Hindus—have classified sins into two major groups: the mahāpātakas or atipātakas (major or mortal sins) and upapātakas (minor or venial sins).</p>
			<p>Brahmahatyā or the killing of a saintly brāhmaṇa, is one of the mahāpātakas that is often mentioned in these works. Any act that will lead either indirectly or directly to the slaying of a brāhmaṇa is brahmahatyā. Even incitement or approval is liable to be branded as brahmahatyā. And it entails unbearable suffering.</p>
			<p>One does not incur brahmahatyā if one kills a brāhmaṇa who is an ātatāyin (a criminal guilty of grave offences), in self-defence.</p>
			<p>With regard to its expiation, there does not seem to be any unanimity among the writers of these works. It ranges from death, up to undergoing severe austerities like offering one&#x2019;s limbs into fire, walking very long distances with very little or no food, performing sacrifices like Aśvamedha or Abhijit or Gosava and so on.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Vedānta system of philosophy posits Brahman (&#x2018;the Unlimited One,&#x2019; &#x2018;the Infinite One,&#x2019; &#x2018;the Absolute&#x2019;) as the origin of the entire universe including the inanimate nature and the living beings. The universe evolves out of it, is sustained in it and involves back into it. Its essential nature is &#x2018;sat-cit-ānanda,&#x2019; &#x2018;existence-consciousness-bliss&#x2019;. It is uncaused and eternal. It is also the very essence of the human beings. Since the human beings do not know this Brahman that is in them or behind them, they are undergoing a lot of suffering caused by the vicious circle of birth-death-rebirth, technically called &#x2018;saṁsāra&#x2019;. Mokṣa or liberating oneself from the bondage of this saṁsāra, is the ultimate goal of life. This mokṣa can be achieved only by brahmajñāna.</p>
			<p>Though the word &#x2018;jñāna&#x2019; means &#x2018;knowledge,&#x2019; &#x2018;brahmajñāna&#x2019; does not mean an intellectual understanding of Brahman. It is anubhūti or direct experience of Brah-man, not only as the substratum of the entire creation, but also as the innermost core of oneself. Once this direct experience comes, there will no more be any identification with the body-mind complex which alone was responsible for saṁsāra.</p>
			<p>In order to get this experience, one has to cultivate the sādhanacatuṣṭaya first. (See <ref>SĀDHANACATUṢṬAYA</ref> for details.) This is to be followed by approaching a competent spiritual preceptor from whom one has to listen (śravaṇa) to the Vedāntic truths, reflect (manana) upon them and meditate (nididhyāsana) upon them. This will ultimately lead to brahmajñāna or the direct experience of Brahman—often equated with ātman, the Self—and result in mokṣa.</p>

			<p>The concept of sin (pātaka, pāpa, agha, enas) is as old as the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself. Later literature like the smṛtis and the dharmaśastras have dealt with it in great detail. Among the several remedies, austerities of a particular class are given the general name &#x2018;kṛcchra.&#x2019; The word means &#x2018;that which cuts, causes pain and suffering.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Of the several kṛcchras mentioned, brahmakṛcchra is also one. It is difficult to say what exactly the word &#x2018;brahma&#x2019; connotes here. Out of the several secondary meanings of the word, &#x2018;tapas&#x2019; (austerity) and &#x2018;bhogatyāga&#x2019; (renunciation of objects of pleasure) may be more appropriate here. It is an austerity involving the giving up of objects of pleasure.</p>
			<p>Brahmakṛcchra is a penance spread over twelve days. It consists in sustaining oneself during that period, by drinking at noon, a little pañcagavya—a preparation of the five products of a cow, viz., milk, curds, ghee, urine and dung—in a temple or a cow-pen, after offering it with mantras in fire. Meditation on Viṣṇu, sleeping near an idol of Viṣṇu and abjuring certain luxuries like betel leaf and unguents—these are the other disciplines mentioned.</p>
			<p>Different kṛcchras are prescribed as expiations for different kinds of sins. The details can be obtained from the relevant dharmaśāstras.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The state of a human being before birth and after death has always been a mystery to us, though the various religions of the world have offered their own explanations.</p>
			<p>According to the Upaniṣads and other allied scriptures, three destinies are possible for a human being: to be reborn here, to go to the Pitṛloka or the world of manes and to go to the Brahmaloka or Satyaloka, the abode of Brahmā.</p>
			<p>The path to the Pitṛloka lies through the Pitṛyāna or Dakṣiṇāyana or Dhūmādi-mārga, the path of smoke.</p>
			<p>The path to the Brahmaloka lies through the Devayāna or Uttarāyaṇa or Arcirādimārga, the path of light.</p>
			<p>The Brahmaloka, also known as the Satyaloka, is the final destination of those who have purified themselves by austerities and meditation. They do not return to this mundane existence. They will be there till the end of the kalpa or the cycle of creation. When the Brahmaloka too gets dissolved in the Supreme Brahman, they will also get merged in It. This is called Kramamukti or gradual liberation as against sadyomukti or instant liberation.</p>
			<p>The purāṇas describe Brahmaloka as the highest of the fourteen worlds, six being above this earth and seven, below. The denizens of this Brahmaloka are said to be completely free from all passions and limitations of the physical body, unlike here.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, the two worlds below Brahmaloka, viz., the Janaloka and the Tapoloka, are also classed with the Brahmaloka and called as such.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Mantras are mystic syllabus or formulae supposed to be endowed with supernatural powers. According to some tāntrik works, mantras can be classified into two groups: the Saguṇa-mantras and the Brāhma-mantras.</p>
			<p>The former are connected with the Saguṇa Brahman (Brahman with attri-butes) and the latter with the Nirguṇa Brahman (Brahman without attributes). Whereas upāsanā or meditation with the former leads to savikalpa-samādhi (samādhi in which the mind takes the form of the deity and results in its reali-zation), upāsanā with the latter results in nirvikalpa-samādhi (samādhi in which the formless Brahman is experienced).</p>
			<p>The well-known mahāvākyas (&#x2018;great sentences&#x2019;) culled from the Upaniṣads chosen from the four Vedas are classed under Brāhma-mantras. The number of the Brāhma-mantras may vary from 12 to 1,80,000. The Gāyatrī-mantra has been described as the best of the Brāhma-mantras.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;that which is big or great&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the most widely used terms in the Hindu religious literature, the word &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019; has several senses: the Vedas, hymns of praise, a priest, one of the four principal priests in a sacrifice representing the <em>Atharvaveda</em>, a brāhmaṇa, tapas or austerity, God the Creator (the four-faced Brahmā) and the Supreme Spirit or the Absolute. However it is in the last sense that it is extensively used, and hence needs greater explanation.</p>
			<p>An oft-occurring theme in the Upaniṣads is the assumption and search for the unity in diversity. &#x2018;What is that, by knowing which, everything else is known?&#x2019;—is a typical question that is raised in them (<em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad.</em> 1.1.3; <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.</em> 4.5.6; <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> 6.1.3). The sages of the Upaniṣads realized in the depths of their mystical experience, that there was a basic reality underlying the entire universe of multiplicity, the One without a second, and called it &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019; is derived from the root &#x2018;bṛh&#x2019; (&#x2018;to grow,&#x2019; &#x2018;to burst forth&#x2019;) and hence means that which is immense and that from which everything else has come out. In other words, it is from Brahman that this world has evolved, it is in Brahman that it rests even after this evolution and again, it is to that Brahman that it returns at the time of involution. &#x2018;Sṛṣṭi,&#x2019; &#x2018;sthiti&#x2019; and &#x2018;laya&#x2019; or &#x2018;pralaya&#x2019; are the three words generally used to indicate these processes. Brahman, however, remains unaffected by this evolution or involution and is ever full and perfect (pūrṇa) in itself.</p>
			<p>The intrinsic power of Brahman with which it creates this world, sustains it and withdraws it into itself, is called &#x2018;māyā&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Since creation is only an evolution of Brahman—which evolution is considered as only apparent and not real, according to some schools of Vedānta—Brahman continues to exist in it as the immanent reality. Thus it is both transcendent and immanent simultaneously.</p>
			<p>Quite often, the Upaniṣads use the word &#x2018;Ātman&#x2019; as synonymous with Brahman. Sat, Akṣara and Bhūmā are some of the other terms used to indicate Brahman.</p>
			<p>The evolution of the world from the Brahman/Ātman is generally traced as follows: From the Brahman evolves ākāśa (ether); from ākāśa comes vāyu (wind) from vāyu comes agni (fire), from agni comes ap (water) and from ap comes pṛthivī (earth). Vegetation and then, life (including the human beings) evolve out of this earth.</p>
			<p>In the Vedāntic works based on the Upaniṣads, four aspects of Brahman have been put forth: the Absolute called Brahman, the creative spirit Īśvara (Lord, God), the world-spirit Hiraṇyagarbha and the world, Virāj.</p>
			<p>The totality of creation which is none other than Brahman in essence, is the Virāj. When Brahman is thought of as the spirit moving everywhere in the world, it is called Hiraṇyagarbha. When conceived as the personal God engaged in the act of creation, protection and destruction of the world, it is called Īśvara. When believed to be established in itself independent of any creation, it is Brahman, the Absolute.</p>
			<p>The Reality is not a sum of these. It is an ineffable unity in which these conceptual distinctions are made.</p>
			<p>Brahman, the Absolute, is unique and different from all that we know and experience here. Hence it can be predicated only in negative terms, &#x2018;neti, neti,&#x2019; &#x2018;not this, not this&#x2019;. This should not mislead us into thinking that it is a non-entity. While it is non-empirical, it is also inclusive of the whole empirical world. And, it has an essential nature of its own: &#x2018;sat&#x2019; or being, &#x2018;cit&#x2019; or consciousness and &#x2018;ānanda&#x2019; or bliss. These are not its characteristics but are different phrases for the same being: self-being, self-consciousness and self-delight.</p>
			<p>There are also passages in the Upaniṣads that describe Brahman as Puruṣa or the Supreme Being. He is the Aupaniṣada-puruṣa, the Being described in the Upaniṣads and known only through them. He is the Hiraṇmaya-puruṣa, the golden Being, the Supreme Soul existing in the āditya or the sun (<em>vide Bṛhadāraṇyaka Up.</em> 3.9.26; <em>Chāndogya Up</em>. 1.6.6), He is the Mahān-puruṣa, the great Person, by knowing whom one can transcend death (<em>Śvetāśvatara Up.</em> 3.8). He is greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest (<em>Kaṭha Up.</em> 1.2.20). He has pervaded everything and has established himself as the inmost Self in all the beings (<em>Īśāvasya Up. </em>1; <em>Kaṭha Up.</em> 2.2.12). He is the Lord of the lords and God of the gods. There is none that is superior to him or even his equal (<em>Śvetāśvatara Up.</em> 6.7-9). He bestows boons on his devotees that worship him (<em>Kaṭha Up.</em> 1.3.2).</p>
			<p>The Vedāntic schools of Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) and Madhva (A. D. 1238-1317) identify Brahman with Viṣṇu/ Nārāyaṇa.</p>

			<p>Vedic sacrifices like the Somayāga comprise elaborate rites needing 16 priests in all: the four principal priests, each having three assistants. Brāhmaṇā-cchaṁsin is an assistant of the fourth principal priest called Brahmā.</p>
			<p>In the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice (which is a model sacrifice in the Somayāga group) special recitations called &#x2018;ājya-śastra&#x2019; have to be chanted, during the first pressing of the soma juice. They are four in number. Brāhmaṇācchaṁsin chants the third recitation addressed to Indra.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the works on Haṭhayoga and Rājayoga, kuṇḍalinī-śakti, the basic energy of a human being, lies dormant like a coiled serpent, at the base of the spinal column in the mūlādhāra-cakra. When roused by proper yogic practices, it crawls up the suṣumnā-nāḍī, the central passage for its flow, encased inside the spinal column and reaches the sahasrāra-cakra at the crown of the head. There it gets merged in Śiva, the Supreme Lord, thus giving enlightenment and bliss to the yogi.</p>
			<p>Inside the suṣumnā-nāḍī, there are three more nāḍīs—vajriṇī, citriṇī and brahmanāḍī—concentric, one inside the other. Brahmanāḍī is the inmost of them stretching from the mūlādhāra to the pericarp of the sahasrāra.</p>
			<p>Since the jīva (individual soul) attains Brahman (God, the Supreme) by raising his kuṇḍalinī-śakti through this nāḍī, it is called Brahmanāḍī.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> became a model for the later generation of writers of didactical literature. Out of several such gītās produced by them, the <em>Brāhmaṇagītā</em> is also one. Actually it is an integral part of a bigger and more well-known work, the <em>Anugītā</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Brāhmaṇagītā</em> comprises the chapters 20 to 34 (15 chapters; 325 verses) of the <em>Āśvamedhikaparva</em>, the fourteenth book of the epic <em>Mahābhārata</em>.</p>
			<p>The wife of a brāhmaṇa approached her husband with an anxious query as to what would happen to her after death since she found him to have abandoned all the actions prescribed in the scriptures and since that would affect her future life also. The brāhmaṇa, who was actually an enlightened person, and hence who had transcended all such actions, started teaching her spiritual wisdom in order to uplift her mind.</p>
			<p>The teaching is couched in a highly symbolical language and often needs expla-nations.</p>
			<p>The subjects dealt with may, very briefly, be summarised as follows: superiority of mind and speech over the other organs, importance of the five prāṇas or vital airs in the body, supremacy of the Lord, who resides in all beings as the antaryāmin or the indweller, stories of Paraśurāma and the king Ambarīṣa, and teaching about the kṣetrajña or the Self.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;[liturgical texts] of Brahman or the Vedas&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Vedas, the basic scriptures of Hinduism, are broadly divided into two parts: the Saṁhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. The latter include the Āraṇyakas and the Upaniṣads, though these latter two are also considered as two more parts, different from the Saṁhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.</p>
			<p>Whereas the Saṁhitās comprise the mantras or hymns in praise of the various Vedic deities like Agni and Indra, the Brāhmaṇas, composed in prose, explain the mantras, prescribe their use in sacrifices and also give the know-how of the sacrifices in detail.</p>
			<p>Yajñas and yāgas—sacrifices offered into the duly consecrated fire—occupied the central place in Vedic religion. Hence, the need for clear and elaborate instructions to conduct them was keenly felt. And, the Brāhmaṇas fulfilled that need.</p>
			<p>The primary content of the Brāhmaṇas can be stated as &#x2018;vidhi&#x2019; or injunctions concerning the various rites and rituals which form a part of the sacrificial system. It comprises such details as: when to perform a sacrifice, which sacrifice for which purpose, who is the person fit to perform it, which are the various components, what are the mantras to be used, where and how, and so on.</p>
			<p>Apart from the vidhis, the Brāhmaṇas also contain other topics: hetu, nirukti, stuti or arthavāda and ākhyāna.</p>
			<p>Those portions of the work that provide logic and reasoning in support of a vidhi are called &#x2018;hetu&#x2019;. Wherever certain words are explained with their etymological derivations, such statements are termed as &#x2018;nirukti&#x2019;. Stuti or arthavāda comprises the statements of praise in support of the injunctions and of derogation, in support of prohibitions. Ākhyānas are stories or narration of ancient incidents interspersed in the body of the Brāhmaṇa literature. They are often full of esoteric meanings or philosophical speculations.</p>
			<p>The Brāhmaṇas occupy a very impor-tant place in the Vedic lore. They provided not only the necessary details for the performance of Vedic rites but also the inspiration to sustain them. The various discussions that used to take place during the Brāhmaṇa period, concerning the several aspects of the sacrificial religion, gave rise to the Mīmāṁsā system of philosophy.</p>
			<p>As in the case of the other ancient Hindu scriptures, it is rather difficult to fix up definitely the date of the Brāhmaṇa literature. Whereas the Western Indologists assign the dates 1200 B. C. to A. D. 200, the Indian scholars, basing their arguments mainly on the astronomical data available in the Brāhmaṇas—like the <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa—</em>push it back to the period 3000 B.C. to 2000 B.C.</p>
			<p>The entire Brāhmaṇa literature is in prose. It is the most ancient prose in Sanskrit literature available to us now. The sentences are simple and straight. Long compound words or grammatically intricate structures are practically unknown. Hence, it is much more intelligible to the readers. The absence of archaic words found in the Saṁhitās and the use of many new words give us the impression that the Sanskrit of the Brāhmaṇas represents a transition stage from the Vedic to the classical Sanskrit.</p>
			<p>The Brāhmaṇas give us an inkling into the contemporary social life too. People were very much devoted to the performance of the sacrifices. Hence they were extensively practised. This naturally led to the brāhmaṇas—members of the first of the four varṇas—occupying the pre-eminent place in the social setup. They were treated practically as gods on earth. However, they had to earn that status through the mastery of the Vedas and tapas or austerities.</p>
			<p>The varṇa system—division of the society into four broad groups based on the natural propensities and professions chosen—had become well-established. The kṣattriya ruler had to submit himself to the guidance and advice of the brāhmaṇas. The vaiśyas were devoted to the development of the whole society through their activities of trade, commerce and agriculture. Those who were not capable of the other three vocations contented themselves in living by serving others. They were the śūdras.</p>
			<p>Great importance was attached to satya and dharma, truth and righteous behaviour. One who forsook the path of truth was considered unfit for the performance of sacrifices. Slipping into sinful ways would result in a vicious circle, thereby obliging the sinners to commit more heinous sins. Hence it had to be avoided at all costs. Since purity in personal life would conduce to the purity of social life, it was highly regarded and stressed. And, the Vedic sacrifices were believed to help the human beings in achieving this goal.</p>
			<p>People hankered for progeny, especi-ally for virtuous sons. A chaste woman was always respected.</p>
			<p>Each of the four Vedas has its own Brāhmaṇas. Since the number of the extant Brāhmaṇas is rather small compared to what has been mentioned in the gṛhyasūtras and other ancient works, it can safely be surmised that many of them have been lost, perhaps irretrievably.</p>
			<p>The Brāhmaṇas available now, may be listed as follows:</p>
			<h2>ṚGVEDA</h2>
			<p><em>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</em> and <em>Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa</em>.</p>
			<h2>YAJURVEDA</h2>
			<p><em>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa</em> and <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em>.</p>
			<h2>SĀMAVEDA</h2>
			<p><em>Tāṇḍya Brāhmaṇa, Ṣaḍviṁśa Brāh-maṇa, Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa</em>,<em> Ārṣeya Brāhmaṇa, Daivata Brāhmaṇa, Saṁhitopaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, Upaniṣad Brāh-maṇa, Vaṁśa Brāhmaṇa</em> and <em>Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa.</em></p>
			<h2>ATHARVAVEDA</h2>
			<p>Gopatha Brāhmaṇa.</p>
			<p>An idea of the contents of these Brāhmaṇas can be obtained under the respective titles.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>How this world in which we live and move and have our being, has been created, has always remained a mystery to the human mind. The Hindu sages have always felt that only the śāstra or the revealed Word, can solve this mystery. However, the accounts of creation given in the Vedas, the Upaniṣads, the smṛtis and the purāṇas are so different—though there are also some common points—that it becomes rather difficult to take as authoritative any one account. That is why commentators on these works stress the point that the main purport of all these works is to point towards God, the creator and the need to know him.</p>
			<p>According to the <em>Manusmṛti</em> (1.7-13) Svayambhū, the Self-existent Being, desi-rous of creating the world, brought out water from himself. He laid the seed over it which developed into a golden egg from which he himself was born as Brahmā, the Creator. This golden egg is called brahmāṇḍa. Brahmā (also called Hiraṇya-garbha) split it into halves and constructed svargaloka (heaven), bhūloka (earth) and antarikṣa (the intervening space). In some works, the number of worlds created is listed as fourteen.</p>

			<p>Giving gifts has always been consi-dered as a sacred act, helping the donor to destroy his sins or to attain higher worlds after death or to get any other result he desires. The Hindu dharma-śāstras have listed certain gifts, as mahādānas or great gifts. They may be ten as per some works and sixteen as per others. Brahmāṇḍa-dāna is one of them. It consists in gifting to a worthy brāhmaṇa, two pans of gold (to represent the dome of heaven above and the earth below) of specified dimensions and with the figures of the eight diggajas (mythical elephants guarding the eight quarters), the lokapālas (rulers of the various worlds and of Brahmā in the middle of them.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the mythological work that deals with the Cosmic Egg&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The purāṇas or the mythological scriptures have played, over the centuries, a very constructive and effective role in educating the Hindu masses. These masses had been denied direct access to the study and knowledge of the Vedas and allied scriptures. However, the need for enlightening them not only in moral and spiritual values but also in certain aspects of secular education, including vocational training, had been keenly felt by the sages and the pragmatic sections of the society. And, the purāṇas fulfilled that need admirably.</p>
			<p>The <em>Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa</em> is the last of the eighteen major purāṇas (mahā-purāṇas). It is called so, probably because, it deals with the brahmāṇḍa, the world and its creation, as a major subject. Hindu tradition attributes its authorship to the sage Vyāsa. It was perhaps composed near the place where the river Godāvarī rises (near Nasik of Maharashtra). Generally considered as one of the oldest of the eighteen purāṇas, it might be assigned to the period A. D. 300-400.</p>
			<p>Since a major part of this purāṇa agrees with the <em>Vāyupurāṇa</em>, some scholars are inclined to think that the two were originally a single work and later split into two due to cult rivalries.</p>
			<p>The work as available in print now, comprises four pādas as follows: <em>Prakriyā</em> (5 chapters), <em>Anuṣaṅga</em> (33 chapters), <em>Upodghāta</em> (74 chapters) and Upasaṁhāra (4 chapters). Thus, the 12,000 verses of this purāṇa are spread over 116 chapters in 4 pādas. This is followed by <em>Lalitopā-khyāna</em> (in 40 chapters) which contains the famous <em>Lalitāsahasranāma</em>, a hymn known for its mystical power and is extremely popular in South India.</p>
			<p>The subjects dealt with in this purāṇa may be summarised briefly as follows: creation, geography of the earth and of Bhāratavarṣa, manvantaras, pupils of Vyāsa and the distribution of the Vedaśākhas or branches of the Vedas; creation of gods, demons, gandharvas, sages and their progeny; all aspects of śrāddha or obsequial ceremonies in detail; exploits of the warrior-sage Paraśurāma; story of the descent of the river Gaṅgā to this earth; Dhanvantari and the Āyurveda, the science of health and longevity.</p>
			<p>The writers of the dharmaśāstras have quoted verses from this purāṇa fairly extensively in support of their views.</p>

		<description>
			<p>According to the Śakti-cult or the cult of the Divine Mother, each one of the major gods of the Hindu pantheon has his śakti or power, portrayed as the female consort or counterpart, with a similar form, weapons and vehicle. Brahmāṇī, also known as Brāhmī, is the śakti of Brahmā, the four-faced god of creation.</p>
			<p>According to the <em>Durgāsaptaśatī</em>, one of the basic texts of the Śakti-cult, when Kauśikī Durgā was fighting the demon Raktabīja—whose blood, if spilled, could produce demons similar to him—she manifested out of herself seven emanations. These are usually called the Saptamātṛkās or &#x2018;Seven little Mothers&#x2019;. Brāhmī or Brahmāṇī is the first among them.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>According to the <em>Matsyapurāṇa </em>when Brahmā was in deep meditation, his pure body divided itself into two halves—male and female—and the female deity came to be known as Brahmāṇī, Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī and Īatarūpā.</p>
			<p>Iconographical works describe her as having four faces and six arms. Her colour is piṅgala or tawny. She wears a deerskin as an upper garment. She holds the rosary and a wooden spoon (sruva) as also a book and a water pot in four hands. The other two hands display the abhaya and the varada mudrās, signifying the giving of protection and boons asked for. She rides on a swan.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Hindu scriptures posit mokṣa or liberation from transmigratory existence as the ultimate goal of life. According to some Vedāntic works, this is attained when the jīva or the individual soul gets merged in Brahman or Paramātman, the Absolute or the Supreme Soul.</p>
			<p>Nirvāṇa means getting extinguished like a burning lamp being blown out. When the little or the individual self (jīvātman) extinguishes itself into Brahman the Absolute, losing its separate identity and becoming merged in Brahman, it is brahmanirvāṅa. Another example that expresses the same idea is the merging of the rivers into the ocean.</p>
			<p>Brahmanirvāṇa or mokṣa can be attained through jñāna (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion).</p>
			<p>This word seems to be peculiar only to the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (<em>vide </em>2.72; 5.24-26).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Scholars from the Western countries who got interested in the study of Hinduism during the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, used the words &#x2018;Brāhmanism,&#x2019; &#x2018;Brāhminism&#x2019; and &#x2018;Vedism&#x2019; to indicate Hinduism. Since God, the Absolute, has been designated as &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019; they used the word &#x2018;Brāhma-nism&#x2019;. Since, according to them, it was a religion practised and propagated by the brāhmaṇas—members of the first of the four varṇas—it was also called &#x2018;Brāhmi-nism&#x2019;. Again, the Vedas being the main and basic scriptures, the appellation &#x2018;Vedism&#x2019; was also used.</p>
			<p>However, a deeper and wider study of all aspects of Hinduism clearly reveals the deficiency of these terms in indicating Hinduism.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the doctrine that Brahman transforms itself [into this world]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The origin of this world, in which we live and move, is one of the important topics invariably discussed in the darśanas or the Indian philosophical systems. The Vedāntic systems, while agreeing that Brahman, the Absolute, is the ultimate cause of this world, are not unanimous about the way of evolution of the world from Brahman. While the Advaita system describes Brahman as the unchanging reality and hence, the world as only an illusory appearance foisted on it due to ignorance of its real nature, the Viśiṣṭā-dvaita system accepts that Brahman does transform itself as this world even as milk becomes curds. (pariṇāma = transformation).</p>
			<p>Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta accepts Brahman (or Īśvara) as the primary reality and cit (the sentient beings, the jīvas or the individual souls) as well as acit (the insentient nature, also called prakṛti) as secondary realities dependent on Brahman. Brahman includes them in itself as an integral part, pervades them and transcends them. It is this acit or prakṛti part that really gets transformed.</p>
			<p>This doctrine which accepts that Brahman transforms itself into this world through its prakṛti-part is known as &#x2018;Brahma-pariṇāma-Vāda&#x2019;.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This word has been used in the Upaniṣads in several senses. Just as a city, (pura = city) full of people and various goods, supplies the wants of the king, this body of several limbs and sense-organs, supplies the needs of Brahman who resides in it in the form of the jīva or the indi-vidual soul. Hence it is called &#x2018;brahmapura&#x2019; or &#x2018;the city of Brahman&#x2019; (<em>vide Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> 8.1.1).</p>
			<p>Sometimes the word is applied to the &#x2018;lotus of the heart&#x2019; (hṛdayapuṇḍarīka—the psychic heart, where meditation is practised) since it &#x2018;houses&#x2019; Brahman; i.e., Brahman is realised there by the practice of meditation on it, there.

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The religious practices of the modern Hindus depend largely upon the information and instruction given by the paurāṇic literature. This literature has grown voluminously over several centuries.</p>
			<p>Hindu tradition recognises 18 mahā-purāṇas or major purāṇas and 18 upa-purāṇas or subsidiary ones. The <em>Brahma-purāṇa</em> (also spelt as <em>Brāhmapurāṇa</em>) is invariably placed at the head of the list of the major purāṇas. It is sometimes called the <em>Ādipurāṇa</em> or the <em>Ādibrahma-purāṇa</em>. It may have attained its present form by the 10th to the 12th century A.D. It gets its name mainly due to the fact that Brahmā narrates it, even though Vyāsa is the narrator in the later part. It may have originated in the Godāvarī basin.</p>
			<p>The <em>Brahmapurāṇa</em>, as available in print now, has 13,783 verses, spread over 245 chapters.</p>
			<p>The contents, which deal with various aspects of Hindu religion may be presented briefly as follows: creation of the world and the living beings, histories of various kings, description of the earth with its seven islands, hells of various types, Dakṣa&#x2019;s sacrifice and its destruction by Śiva, detailed descriptions of various places of pilgrimage like Ekāmra, Avantī and Puruṣottamakṣetra (Purī), origin of the river Gaṅgā, story of Rāvaṇa, story of the king Hariścandra, story of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in detail, various avatāras or incarnations of Viṣṇu, performance of śrāddhas or obsequial rites, spiritual wisdom contained in Sāṅkhya and Yoga darśanas, and a eulogy of listening to the whole purāṇa.</p>
			<p>Its treatment of the places of pilgrimage is fairly exhaustive and its verses on this subject have been extensively quoted by the writers on the dharmaśāstras.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The crevice in the crown of the head is called &#x2018;brahmarandhra&#x2019; since Brahman (Īśvara or God) is said to have entered this body through this randhra or crevice, after creating it, to make it alive (<em>vide Aitareya Upaniṣad</em> 1.3.12).</p>
			<p>If a person manages to leave the body at the time of death, through this randhra, he goes to Brahmaloka or the world of Brahmā. Hence the name. Of course, this is possible only for great yogīs, persons of very high spiritual evolution.</p>
			<p>Works on Haṭhayoga describe this brahmarandhra as the top end of the suṣumnā canal.</p>

			<p>A ṛṣi is one who has known the truth (ṛṣ = to know) or attained the final goal (ṛṣ = to attain) of life. Of the seven types of ṛṣis mentioned in the Hindu religious works, the brahmarṣi stands as the first or the highest in eminence. He has known or experienced Brahman, the Absolute, the Self of all, and has thus reached the other end of saṁsāra or transmigratory existence.</p>
			<p>If the word &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019; is interpreted as the Vedas, then, the brahmarṣi is one who has obtained a thorough knowledge of the Vedas.</p>

			<word>Brahma-Samāj</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<h3>a)	The background</h3>
			<p>During the latter part of the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth, the Hindu society was in a state of turmoil. English education and Christian culture imposed on a subject nation by the British rulers and their comrades, the Christian Church, had had a devastating effect on the minds of the younger generation. They were fast losing faith in their mother religion, Hinduism, as also in the Hindu values of life and culture. It was at this critical juncture that three renaissance movements sprang forth from the bosom of Hinduism. The Brahma Samāj (also spelt as Brāhmo Samāj) was the earliest in the series, followed by the Ārya Samāj and the Ramakrishna Movement.</p>
			<h3>b)	A Brief History</h3>
			<p>Rājā Rāmmohan Roy (A.D. 1772-1833), the founder of the Brahma Samāj was born in a village in the Hoogly district of Bengal in 1772. Not much is known of his early life. He settled down in Calcutta in 1814. By the time he came into prominence he was already a good scholar in Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic languages. Later on, he mastered the English language also. Being dissatisfied with the various Hindu religious practices of his times like idol worship, child-marriage and Satī (burning of widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands) as also the problems of young widows, and, after studying deeply the dharmaśāstras (Hindu law-books) he came to the conclusion that these were later accretions responsible for the decadence of the Hindu society. With a view to reforming the Hindu social values and practices and take them back to their original source, viz., the Upaniṣads, he established the Brahma Samāj on August 20, 1828. Scholars of repute like Rāmacandra Vidyā-vāgīśa, Utsavānanda Vidyāvāgīśa and Tārācandra Cakravartī were his collaborators in this work. He succeeded in building a permanent home for it in 1830.</p>
			<p>When he passed away in 1833, there was a temporary setback to the movement. However, the entry of Dvārakānāth Ṭhākūr and his son Devendranāth Ṭhākūr (father of the famous poet, Rabindranath Tagore) rejuvenated the movement, the contribution of the latter being much more.</p>
			<p>It was the &#x2018;Maharṣi&#x2019; Devendranāth Ṭhākūr (as he was popularly known) that introduced the study of the Upaniṣads and allied literature through a formal seat of learning which he named as &#x2018;Tattvabodhinī Sabhā&#x2019;. This Sabhā attracted the attention of the elite and its membership swelled. He also composed the text of the oath that every member of the Samāj had to take at the time of admission into it and framed a code of conduct to be followed by all.</p>
			<p>Keśavacandra Sen (A. D. 1838-1884), the younger contemporary of the Maharṣi Devendranāth was the next important leader of this movement. He became the ācārya or minister when he was hardly twentyfour. He paid much greater attention to the propagation of the Brāhmo ideals and social reforms. He started the <em>Vāmābodhinī</em>, a Bengali journal meant exclusively for women as also the English journal <em>Indian Mirror</em>. He toured the country extensively, delivering lectures and opened a branch—the Veda Samāja—at Madras in 1864. Serious differences with his mentor Devendranāth led to his parting of ways and establishing his own organization, the &#x2018;Brahma Samāj of India&#x2019; (&#x2018;Bhārat-Varṣīya Brahma Samāj&#x2019;) in 1866. The parent body came to be known as the &#x2018;Ādi Brahma Samāj&#x2019;. Whereas the latter considered the Brahma Samāj movement as an integral part of Hinduism, the doors of the former were open to the non-Hindus also. Keśavacandra Sen&#x2019;s Samāj suffered a serious setback when Paṇḍit Śivnāth Śāstrī got separated from him and established the &#x2018;Sādhāraṇ Brahma Samāj&#x2019; in 1878. Keśav&#x2019;s marrying his minor daughter to the prince of Cooch Bihar, against the rules of the Samāj which he himself had framed or endorsed, was one of the main reasons for this schism.</p>
			<p>After Keśavacandra Sen, there being no leaders of comparable eminence, the influence of the Brāhmo movement gradually waned and it is now almost a spent force.</p>
			<h3>c)	The Creed and the Rituals</h3>
			<p>According to the famous Trust Deed of the Brahma Samāj created by Rājā Rāmmohan Roy, image worship in any form is to be totally abjured, though its practice by others shall not be reviled. It accepts the philosophy of the Upaniṣads but rejects Vedic ritualism and the worship of several deities current in the Hindu society. It believes in one God, Brahman, the formless Supreme Reality. It lays great emphasis on the cultivation of moral virtues and advocates social reforms like education of women, remarriage of widows, equal share for women in parental property, toning down of the caste distinctions and so on.</p>
			<p>The pratijñā or the oath to be taken by every member at the time of admission into the Samāj, as introduced by Devendra-nāth, emphasised the need to repeat the Gāyatrīmantra before food, to give up image worship in any form, to pay the prescribed subscription to the Samāj regularly and to shape one&#x2019;s life according to the principles of Vedānta advocated by the founder.</p>
			<p>Devendranāth also systematised the rites to be performed at birth, at the time of naming the child, during marriage and at the time of death—all in consonance with the basic principles of the Samāj.</p>
			<p>The service conducted during the weekly meetings generally consisted of Vedic chanting behind a screen, readings from the Upaniṣads, discourses and prayers. Singing of devotional songs was added later on by Keśavacandra Sen.</p>
			<h3>d)	Epilogue</h3>
			<p>The Brahma Samāj rendered useful service to the Hindu society by popularising social reforms like the abolition of the practice of the Satī, by preventing conversion of the Hindus to Christianity and by rousing the orthodox Hindus to revive their ancient religion. However, its refusal to recognize the accepted canon of Hindu scriptures and certain deep-rooted beliefs like the faith in the Avatāras or incarnations of God, undermined its credibility in the eyes of the common Hindu masses. This may be the chief reason for its listless existence now.</p>

			<p>Kurukṣetra, where the Mahābhārata war, between the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas, is said to have been fought, is a famous place of pilgrimage even now. It is situated in the Karnal-Ambala region of Haryana, about 40 kms. (26 miles) to the east of the Ambala city.</p>
			<p>According to the purāṇas it was surrounded by five lakes called &#x2018;Samantapañcaka.&#x2019; One of these lakes, the biggest, is called Brahmasarovara or Brahmasaras. Since it is situated in the present Kuru-kṣetra region, it is commonly known as the Kurukṣetra lake. It is also called Pavanahrada. It is 1320 meters (4400 ft.) long and 640 meters (2100 ft.) wide.</p>
			<p>Brahmā, the creator, is said to have had his yūpasthambha or the sacrificial pillar here. Hence the name &#x2018;Brahma-sarovara.&#x2019; King Kuru, from whom the race of the Kurus originated, is said to have performed tapas here.</p>
			<p>There are two small islands inside this lake containing an ancient temple of Viṣṇu and the ruins of some old temples.</p>
			<p>Taking a bath in this lake, especially during the solar eclipse, is considered to be extremely auspicious. Great merit also accrues to those who circumambulate it.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Brahmasiddhi</em> of Maṇḍana Miśra (A.D. 800) is one of the four major independent treatises of Advaita Vedānta belonging to the <em>Siddhi</em>-group. The other three are: <em>Naiṣkarmyasiddhi</em> of Sureśvara (A. D. 800), <em>Iṣṭasiddhi</em> of Vimuktātman (A.D. 1200) and <em>Advaitasiddhi</em> of Madhusūdana Sarasvatī (A. D. 1500).</p>
			<p>The traditional view that Maṇḍana Miśra and Sureśvara were one and the same person has not been accepted by scholars of repute in the field.</p>
			<p>The work is in four chapters: <em>Brahmakāṇḍa</em>, <em>Tarkakāṇḍa</em>, <em>Niyogakāṇḍa</em> and <em>Siddhikāṇḍa</em>. It is in the form of verses (kārikā) and long annotations (vṛtti). Out of the four commentaries said to have been written, that of Śaṅkhapāṇi has been traced and utilised by the savants interested in it. </p>
			<p>In the <em>Brahmakāṇḍa</em>, nature of Brahman is discussed. The <em>Tarkakāṇḍa</em> discusses questions regarding perception and whether &#x2018;difference&#x2019; can be perceived at all. The <em>Niyogakāṇḍa</em>—the longest of the four chapters—refutes certain views of the Mīmāṁsā school. The <em>Siddhikāṇḍa</em>, the shortest, tries to show that the Upaniṣadic texts treat this world of multiplicity as an appearance due to avidyā or ignorance.</p>
			<p>The Advaita Vedānta as propounded here differs from that of Śaṅkara in certain respects. Yet, it is considered as an important handbook of Advaita.</p>

The icon of the deity is placed in the centre of this. Below the icon, several objects are placed one above the other, starting with the ādhāraśilā (base stone). Over this are placed a pot, tortoise and lotus made of stone, two more tortoises and lotuses made of silver and gold and a funnel shaped tube called &#x2018;yoganālā&#x2019; above which the slab brahmaśilā is placed.

			<p>The art and science of warfare was highly developed in ancient India, if the accounts of war given in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Mahābhārata</em> are to be believed.</p>
			<p>Weapons used were divided into two broad categories: astras and śastras. Astras were missiles discharged from their sources like the bow. Śastras were weapons used by directly holding them in hand. Arrows, discuses and spears belong to the first, whereas swords belong to the second category. </p>
			<p>By far, the most powerful of all the astras often mentioned in the epics and the mythological lore is the Brahmāstra also called &#x2018;Brahmaśirostra&#x2019;. Śiva is said to have given it to the sage Agastya. Agastya gave it to Agniveśa who gave it to Droṇa. Arjuna got it from Droṇa. </p>
			<p>According to another version, Brahmā the creator specially made it for Devendra. The sage Agastya who got it in course of time, handed it over to Śrī Rāma.</p>
			<p>It is more likely that the Brahmāstra was not a particular missile physically existent, but a terrible power that could be invoked into any missile by the appropriate mantras. Its use was restric-ted to extraordinary situations and when the enemy was not an ordinary human being. </p>
			<p>Śrī Rāma is reputed to have killed Rāvaṇa with this Brahmāstra.</p>

		<description>
			<h3>Preamble—Sūtras</h3>
			<p>The system of education in ancient India required the students to live in the campus of a forest academy along with the teachers. The teaching imparted was, almost always, in the form of sūtras or aphorisms, followed by explanations and discussions. At a time when committing things to memory was considered supremely important, this method suited admirably.</p>
			<p>The sūtra literature is a class by itself. As per the norms set for a sūtra, it should be &#x2018;alpākṣara&#x2019; (consisting of minimum number of letters), &#x2018;asandigdha&#x2019; (without doubt as regards the meaning), &#x2018;sāravat&#x2019; (must contain the essence of the subject) and yet &#x2018;viśvatomukham&#x2019; (reflect all aspects of the same). However, in their anxiety to economise the words, the composers of the sūtra-works seem to have so overdone it that bhāṣyas or explanatory commentaries by later writers became necessary.</p>
			<p>The śrauta, the gṛhya and the dharma sūtras form the earliest bunch of sūtra literature. The darśanas or the philosophical systems which are of a later period, followed this sūtra model since it served their purpose well.</p>
			<h3>Vedānta Darśana</h3>
			<p>Out of the six darśanas or systems of philosophy which accept the authority of the Vedas (the basic scriptures of Hinduism), the last two—the Mīmāṁsā and the Vedānta systems—are directly connected with them. Whereas the former tries to reconcile the various Vedic texts that seem to give different directions with regard to the same ritual system, the latter attempts to make out a coherent philosophy of Brahman (God, the Absolute) from the apparently conflicting statements in the Upaniṣads.</p>
			<h3>Prasthānatraya</h3>
			<p>The Vedānta system, as its very name implies, deals with the Upaniṣads which are the end-portions (anta = end) of the Vedas and also contain the essence (anta = core or essence) of the same. The system itself is based on three canonical works: the Upaniṣads, the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> and the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>. The Upaniṣads are called &#x2018;śrutiprasthāna&#x2019;, the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, &#x2018;nyāyaprasthāna&#x2019; and the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, &#x2018;smṛtiprasthāna&#x2019;, the three together being termed &#x2018;prasthānatraya&#x2019;. &#x2018;Prasthāna&#x2019; means a school of philosophy or religion.</p>
			<h3>The Upaniṣads</h3>
			<p>Though a very large number of works going by the name &#x2018;Upaniṣad&#x2019; are available in print today, orthodox tradition accepts only a handful of them—twelve to fourteen—as ancient and authoritative. The entire edifice of the Vedānta system of philosophy depends upon these few Upaniṣads.</p>
			<p>The teachings of the Upaniṣads may, broadly speaking, be classified as follows: Brahman as the ultimate cause of this world, nature of Brahman, evolution of this world and its character, nature of the living being as individual souls, their relationship with Brahman, their involvement in this world as well as their transmigration, the final goal of life, the disciplines that help in reaching that goal and the nature of attainment of that final goal. </p>
			<p>It is a fact that the Upaniṣads, as extant today, do not give a coherent picture of these various subjects discussed in them. Since tradition and orthodoxy deem the entire body of the Upaniṣads as one canonical scripture—the Śruti—it became necessary to reinterpret and reorganise their teachings so as to give them a more coherent look. It was exactly this that Bādarāyaṇa attempted and the result was the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>.</p>
			<h3>The Brahmasūtras</h3>
			<p>The work derives its name from the fact that it deals chiefly with Brahman (God, the Absolute) as described in the Upaniṣads, in all its aspects. It is also known by other names as follows:</p>
			<ul calss="lower-alpha">
				<li>The <em>Vedāntasūtras</em>, since the subject matter is that of Vedānta or the Upaniṣads;</li>
				<li>The <em>Śārīrakasūtras</em>, since the Ātman living in the śarīra or the body is dealt with in the work;</li>
				<li>The <em>Uttaramīmāṁsāsūtras </em> (as opposed to the <em>Pūrvamīmāṁsāsūtras</em>) since it does mīmāṁsā or enquiry into the uttara or latter part of the Vedas;</li>
				<li>The <em>Bhikṣusūtras</em> since it is specially recommended for study by the bhikṣus or the saṁnyāsins.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Bādarāyaṇa, the Author</h3>
			<p>Nothing is known about Bādarāyaṇa, the author of this celebrated work. Tradi-tionalists identify him with Vyāsa, the author of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> and the purāṇas. The work is generally assigned to the period 500 B. C.-200 B. C. by the Indian and some Western scholars. However there are other scholars who consider the two to be different and assign Bādarāyaṇa to the period A. D. 200.</p>
			<h3>About the Work</h3>
			<p>The work <em>Brahmasūtras</em> is in four adhyāyas or chapters. Each adhyāya is divided into four pādas or quarters. The pādas comprise adhikaraṇas or topics, each composed of sūtras.</p>
			<p>The total number of adhikaraṇas and sūtras, according to Śaṅkara, the earliest commentator, are 191 and 555 respectively. However, variations are seen in this number as also in the readings themselves. Splitting one sūtra into two, fusing two sūtras into one or adding the last word of a sūtra to the beginning of the next are some of the reasons for such variations in the readings. Such alterations in the structure of the sūtras have contributed to divergent interpretations also. Not only that, divergent views have also arisen due to one school considering a particular sūtra as stating the pūrvapakṣa (the <em>prima facie</em> view, the objection or doubt) and another school accepting the same sūtra as the siddhānta (the theory propounded by the author of the work).</p>
			<p>As already stated, each pāda of the various adhyāyas, comprises several adhikaraṇas or topics. An adhikaraṇa needs must have five parts connected in a graded manner. They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>viṣaya or topic;</li>
				<li>viśaya or saṁ-śaya, doubt;</li>
				<li>pūrvapakṣa or opponent&#x2019;s view;</li>
				<li>siddhānta or established conclusion and</li>
				<li>saṅgati or connection between the different sections.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The number of sūtras in any adhikaraṇa depends on the nature of the subject under discussion. Thanks to the ambiguity in the sūtras, the titles and the number of the adhikaraṇas vary from commentator to commentator. </p>
			<p>While Nimbārka (13th century A.D.) has the minimum number of adhikaraṇas (151), Madhuvā (A.D. 1238-1317) has the maximum (223).</p>
			<p>The purport of the sūtra itself is determined by the commentators as per the principle of ṣaḍvidhaliṅgas or six characteristic signs. They are: upakrama and upasaṁhāra (the beginning and the end), abhyāsa (repetition), apūrvatā (novelty), phala (objective), arthavāda (eulogy) and upapatti (logicality).</p>
			<p>True to its name, the work <em>Brahma-sūtras</em>, deals primarily with Brahman as the highest truth, by realising which, a person transcends transmigratory existence. The one and only authority for the existence of Brahman as also for its true nature is the śruti, the jñanakāṇḍa part (section dealing with the knowledge of Brahman/ Ātman) of the Vedas, comprising the Upaniṣads. This knowledge of Brahman can never be obtained by logic and reasoning which depend upon the puny human intellect. Since the intellect depends upon the knowledge gained by the senses and since Brahman, the pure consciousness that he is, is beyond the ken of the senses, the śruti as revealed to the ṛṣis is the only source for knowing him.</p>
			<p>This takes us to the next point—the various Upaniṣadic statements that form the basis for the philosophy of the <em>Brahma-sūtras</em>. Since some of these statements appeared to contradict one another, Bāda-rāyaṇa had to undertake the unenviable task of collating them to weave out a homogeneous philosophy. While doing it, he naturally chose the most ancient of the Upaniṣads. Which are those Upaniṣads the statements of which, Bādarāyaṇa has discussed in these sūtras? There is no direct indication in the sūtras themselves since they are too laconic. For this we have to depend almost entirely on the bhāṣyakāras or the commentators who, fortunately for us, are more or less unanimous in deciphering the same.</p>
			<p>In the first 31 adhikaraṇas (as per Śaṅkara) the major statements that form the viṣaya or viṣayavākya (subject matter) are from the following Upaniṣads, with the number of such sentences noted against them:</p>
			<p><em>Chāndogya</em> (14), <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> (5), <em>Kaṭha</em> (4), <em>Taittirīya</em> (2), <em>Muṇḍaka</em> (3), <em>Praśna</em> (1) and <em>Kauṣītaki</em>(2).</p>
			<p>Apart from these, sentences taken from the <em>Śvetāśvatara</em>, the <em>Aitareya</em> and the <em>Jābāla</em> have also been discussed.</p>
			<p>While analysing the purport of the various passages from the Upaniṣads, Bādarāyaṇa has quoted the opinions of other teachers also. They are: Ātreya, Āśmarathya, Auḍulomi, Kārṣṇājani, Kāśa-kṛtsna, Jaimini and Bādari. Almost all these names appear in the earlier works like the śrauta-sūtras and the gṛhyasūtras. It is likely that some preceded Bādarāyaṇa and others like Jaimini might have been his contemporaries. Though he differed from them, he has not criticised their views, probably because they were also Vedāntins of repute, who had accepted the Upaniṣads as the primary authority and Brahman as the highest Truth.</p>
			<h3>A Brief Synopsis</h3>
			<p>The contents of the work may now be summarised as follows:</p>
			<h2>First Chapter</h2>
			<p>The first chapter comprising 134 sūtras in 39 adhikaraṇas has been called <em>Samanvayādhyāya</em>, (samanvaya = harmony) since it attempts to harmonise the principles dealt with in the various Upaniṣads.</p>
			<p>The work starts with the famous sūtra <em>athāto brahmajijñāsā</em> (&#x2018;Now, therefore, the desire to know Brahman&#x2019;). Since the knowledge or experience of Brahman, leads to mokṣa or freedom from transmigration, it is very necessary to have a correct understanding of Brahman. Keeping this in view, the treatise deals with the various statements in the well-known Upaniṣads concerning Brahman. Brahman is he from whom this world came into existence, in whom it inheres and to whom it returns at the end of a cycle of creation. The only source for the knowledge of this Brahman is the śruti or the Upaniṣads.</p>
			<p>It is Brahman alone who is the ultimate cause of this world and not prakṛti or pradhāna as the Sāṅkhyas aver, since it is insentient. An insentient cause can never think or will and produce such a perfectly designed universe. </p>
			<p>This Brahman is ānandamaya, full of bliss. He is transcendent as well as immanent in this world, including the jīvātmas or the individual souls. The being of light that exists in āditya or the Sun and our eyes is also Brahman. He is also designated as ākāśa, prāṇa, bhūmā and akṣara. The being described as &#x2018;aṅguṣṭha-mātra puruṣa&#x2019; (the person of the size of the thumb) is also really Brahman and not the jīva or the individual soul. So also does the word Ātman refer to him.</p>
			<p>Bādarāyaṇa quotes the opinions of Āśmarathya, Auḍulomi and Kāśakṛtsna in the fourth pāda of this chapter. Āśmarathya thinks that the jīvātmas are both different and non-different from Brahman (or Paramātman) even as the sparks of fire are both identical with and different from fire. Auḍulomi opines that the jīvas are different from Brahman in the state of bondage but become one with him in the state of liberation. Kāśakṛtsna, however, considers the two to be identical since it is Brahman that has become the jīva also.</p>
			<p>Though the views of these teachers are stated, Bādarāyaṇa does not give his own opinion or preference.</p>
			<p>The last part of this chapter asserts that Brahman is both the upādānakāraṇa (material cause) and the nimitta kāraṇa (efficient cause) for this world.</p>
			<h2>Second Chapter</h2>
			<p>Designated as <em>Avirodhādhyāya</em>, this chapter with 157 sūtras distributed among 47 adhikaraṇas applies itself to dispel any virodha or contradiction that may confront this philosophy of Vedānta.</p>
			<p>Vedānta is not opposed to smṛti (secondary scriptures like the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and <em>Āpastamba Dharmasūtras</em>) and tarka (logic and reasoning). The opposition of schools like that of Sāṅkhya is fallible. There is no contradiction among the various statements in the Upaniṣads dealing with subjects like creation. This is the burden of the teaching of this chapter.</p>
			<p>Out of the several non-Vedāntic systems of philosophy that existed during Bādarāyaṇa&#x2019;s time, the Sāṅkhya system was the most powerful. Hence it has been given special attention while refuting other schools.</p>
			<p>One of the important factors discussed here is the relationship between the kāraṇa (the cause) and the kārya (the effect). The Sāṅkyan view known as &#x2018;Satkāryavāda&#x2019; states that the kārya or the effect pre-exists (sat = existing) in the kāraṇa or cause. In the process of creation it just gets manifested and is not newly produced, since something real can never be produced from the unreal. On the other hand the Vaiśeṣika school accepts the &#x2018;asat-kārya-vāda,&#x2019; according to which the previously non-existent (= asat) effect is newly produced. In the former case, the effect pre-exists in the upādāna-kāraṇa (the material cause) and in the latter, the nimitta-kāraṇa (the efficient cause) is constant. Bādarāyaṇa accepts these views partially and declares, on the basis of the Upaniṣads, that Brahman is &#x2018;abhinna-nimitta-upādāna-kāraṇa&#x2019;, both the material and the efficient cause, for this world. Hence this world is non-different from Brahman. The objection that this world consists of insentient objects and hence cannot be the product of the sentient Brahman does not hold good, since the Śruti, the highest authority in such matters which are beyond the powers of the ordinary human intellect, declares it to be so.</p>
			<p>Brahman has no selfish motive in creating this world, since he is self-contented. There is neither partiality nor cruelty in this creation since justice is meted out to the jīvas according to their karmas or deserts. The very purpose of creation of this world is to help the jīvas to attain ānanda or bliss by getting established in Brahman, the Bliss-Absolute.</p>
			<p>Apart from the Sāṅkhya school, the other schools like those of the Vaiśeṣikas, the Buddhists, the Jains, the Pāśupatas and the Bhāgavatas, like the Pañcarātras have also been critically examined and dismissed. </p>
			<h2>Third Chapter</h2>
			<p>The third chapter is called <em>Sādhanā-dhyāya</em> and is the longest with 186 sūtras spread over 67 adhikaraṇas. Though called thus, the topics discussed are diverse. They are: transmigration of the jīva into other bodies, dream-creations of the jīva, its experiencing the deserts of karma by the will of Īśvara or God, various vidyās or meditations mentioned in the Upaniṣads and clarifications regarding them, collating of a vidyā when described differently in different Upaniṣads, knowledge of the Ātman or Brahman as independent of karmas or rituals and duties prescribed for the various āśramas (stages of life like brahmacarya or saṁnyāsa) as also prāyaś-cittas (expiations) and so on.</p>
			<h2><em>Fourth Chapter</em> </h2>
			<p>Known as <em>Phalādhyāya</em> this chapter is the shortest with only 78 sūtras and 38 adhikaraṇas. The main topic discussed is the journey of the jīva after death to Brahmaloka by the &#x2018;arcirādimārga&#x2019; or &#x2018;devayāna&#x2019;, the path of light or of gods.</p>
			<p>One who is interested in mokṣa or liberation has to practise śravaṇa (listening to the scriptures describing the nature of Ātman [Brahman] and allied disciplines until realisation). The various upāsanās or meditations described in the Upaniṣads aid the jīva in the process of attaining mokṣa. On attaining brahmajñāna or knowledge of Brahman, sañcita-karma (karma accumulated over several lives) gets destroyed. Āgāmī-karma, karma done after realisation is rendered fruitless. The prārabdha-karma, the karma that has already started this body and yielding the results, has to be exhausted only by experiencing it.</p>
			<p>The jīvas who have practised severe spiritual disciplines like tapas (austerity), śraddhā (devoted faith) and brahmacarya (celibacy), as also vidyās like meditation on Brahman will travel, after death, by the arcirādimārga or the path of light comprising light, day, bright fortnight and so on, and reach the Brahmaloka from which there is no return. There are divine guides called &#x2018;ātivāhikās&#x2019; who take the jīva through the various stations of light to the Brahmaloka.</p>
			<p>Anomalies in the descriptions concerning the details of the arcirādimārga have been set right through proper interpretations and arguments.</p>
			<p>The work ends with the declaration, &#x2018;anāvṛttiḥ śabdāt,&#x2019; repeated twice for emphasis, (&#x2018;There is no return since the scriptures declare so.&#x2019;) meaning that the jīva reaching Brahmaloka will not return to this mundane existence. Descriptions of the nature of the muktapuruṣa, the liberated soul, are given at the appropriate places. The views of Jaimini, Auḍulomi and Bādari in this regard have also been cited.</p>
			<h3>The Philosophy of Bādarāyaṇa</h3>
			<p>Bādarāyaṇa wrote the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> to systematise the teachings of the Upa-niṣads into a coherent philosophy. However, since the sūtras are short and terse, it becomes quite a job to find out what exactly is his own philosophy as revealed through this work. Even so, with the help of the sūtras which seem to be more unambiguous than the others, an attempt may now be made to portray the same.</p>
			<p>The one and only pramāṇa (source of knowledge) that Bādarāyaṇa accepts while expounding the Vedānta system is Śruti or the Vedas, especially the jñāna-kaṇḍa part or it, <em>viz.,</em> the Upaniṣads. He considers the words of the Vedas as nitya or eternal. Logic and reasoning, which can always be unsettled by superior ones, can never be relied upon in determining the transcendental truths like the ultimate Cause of the world. Smṛtis or secondary scriptures like the <em>Manusmṛti</em> and the <em>Mahābhārata</em> including the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> can also be depended upon in so far as they do not contradict the Śruti.</p>
			<p>The Śruti declares Brahman as the origin of this universe, the primary, nay, the only truth. In fact, the very definition (<em>janmādyasya yataḥ</em>, 1.1.2) makes him the uncaused cause, the ground of sustenance and involution of the world. He is both the material and efficient cause for the world. He needs no external implements or assistance and can transform himself even as milk is transformed into its products. </p>
			<p>He evolves himself into ākāśa (ether), vāyu (air) and other products by willing the same; and, he is associated with every stage of creation up to the last.</p>
			<p>Since it is Brahman that has evolved into this world, this world is non-different from him, even as an unfolded cloth is non-different from the same which was earlier folded.</p>
			<p>The activity of creation is a līlā or effortless sport for Brahman. But, since it is done as per the karmas of the unredeemed jīvas, one should not attribute partiality or cruelty to him, seeing the good and evil that exist here.</p>
			<p>As regards the jīva or the individual soul, Bādarāyaṇa defines him as a &#x2018;jña&#x2019; or knower, a being endowed with consciousness. He has no birth or death. He is eternal and atomic in size. Whether the jīva is an aṁśa (part) of Brahman or his ābhāsa (reflection) has not been stated clearly though the views of other Vedāntins like Āśmarathya, Auḍulomi and Kāśakṛtsna have been given.</p>
			<p>The relationship between the jīva and Brahman has been likened to the snake and its coiled-up state or light and its source. Thus the question whether they are different or identical has been left unanswered.</p>
			<p>By meditation on Ātman/Brahman leading to jñāna, or experience of the same, the jīva attains liberation. The Śrutis give equal importance to the perfor-mance of karma or prescribed actions and tyāga or renunciation of the same, though the performance of duties prescribed for the respective āśramas (stages of life) has been stressed even for the spiritual aspirant. The fruits of the various upāsanās or meditations practised by a jīva accrue to him by the grace of Īśvara (Brahman as the ruler of the created world).</p>
			<p>On attaining the knowledge of Brahman all the sañcita karma (accumulated past karma) of the jīva will be destroyed. He will live as long as the prārabdha karma (karma already fructified) lasts. But, the karma does after attaining knowledge will not affect him.</p>
			<p>The jīva who has reached the acme of meditation while living, will, after death, travel by the arcirādimārga or devayāna (the path of light or of the gods) and reach Brahmaloka from which there is no return to this world. There, he will be one with Brahman, non-different from him. The various attributes predicated of Brahman get manifested in the liberated jīva. Caitanya or consciousness, being his essential nature, is of course, always there.</p>
			<p>In conclusion it can be affirmed that Bādarāyaṇa, in these sūtras, teaches a kind of advaita (Brahmādvaita?).</p>
			<p>He does not admit the existence of either the jīvas or the world, as indepen-dent of or different from Brahman. Since he has accepted the Upaniṣads as the supreme authority and since the other teachers like Bādari whom he has quoted, also did the same, he has not contradicted them. Both the views—that Brahman is nirviśeṣa-cinmātra-svarūpa (pure consciousness without any attributes) and saviśeṣa (with attributes)—seem to be acceptable to him. Obviously he has tried to reconcile the various, apparently conflicting, views expressed in the Upaniṣads and explain them rather than formulate his own philosophy.</p>
			<h3>The Commentators and their Works</h3>
			<p>The Vedas have been the foundation of Hindu religion and culture for millennia. The philosophy of Vedānta based on the Upaniṣads has held sway over the intelligentsia for centuries. Hence, it is but natural that the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> of Bāda-rāyaṇa has attracted the attention of the distinguished scholars over the years who have enriched the Vedānta literature by their brilliant expositions. All these commentators have evinced great respect for Bādrāyaṇa and his monumental work. They have tried to critically examine all the other schools that were important during their days and to prove the superiority of the Vedānta over them. Of course, they were equally keen to establish their own school of Vedānta also.</p>
			<p>Of the several bhāṣyas or commen-taries available to us today, that of Śaṅkara is the earliest. There might have been quite a few bhāṣyas composed by the earlier writers. It can however be stated with certainty that Upavarṣa, to whom Śaṅkara refers in his commentary (1.3.28; 3.3.53) must have been one such. Bodhāyana, another commentator, referred to as &#x2018;vṛttikāra&#x2019; by Rāmānuja, is sometimes identified with this Upavarṣa though there is no unanimity regarding it. </p>
			<p>The following list of commentators who have left bhāṣyas directly on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> may be useful to the students of Vedānta philosophy:</p>

			<p>A brief summary of the more important of these schools may now be given. Since the schools propounded by Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja and Madhva are more well-known and gained precedence over the others, they will be taken up first.</p>
			<h2>Śaṅkara</h2>
			<p>Śaṅkara&#x2019;s darśana or philosophy as revealed in his bhāṣyas on the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, the ten ancient Upaniṣads and the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> is now well-known as Advaita Vedānta. The oft-quoted and famous verse &#x2018;brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā jīvo brahmaiva nāparaḥ&#x2019; (&#x2018;Brahman alone is real; this world is only an illusory appearance. The jīva is verily Brahman and is not different from him.&#x2019;) gives this philosophy in a nutshell. </p>
			<p>Śaṅkara categorises Brahman into two aspects: Para-brahman and Apara-brahman. Where the Upaniṣadic statements deny all limiting adjuncts like name and form, created by avidyā or ignorance of his essential nature to Brahman, he is Para, the higher, Brahman. On the other hand, where these statements describe him as endowed with name, form and several attributes, it is the Apara or the lower, Brahman that is referred to. It is the latter that is the cause for the creation of this world, its sustenance and its dissolution.</p>
			<p>Really speaking, Brahman does not get transformed into this world. The multiplicity of names and forms is only a &#x2018;vivarta,&#x2019; an appearance, due to avidyā or ignorance, even as a snake is perceived in a rope in insufficient light. This, he calls as &#x2018;adhyāsa&#x2019; or &#x2018;adhyāropa&#x2019; (superimposition). Through vidyā or discriminative knowledge, &#x2018;apavāda&#x2019; or desuperimposition takes place giving the true knowledge of the reality. </p>
			<p>Śaṅkara considers the jīvas as caitanya or pure consciousness, but, circumscribed by the antaḥkaraṇa (the &#x2018;inner organ&#x2019; or mind). The jīva, though nitya (eternal), śuddha (pure), buddha (awakened) and mukta (free), appears as kartā (the doer) and bhoktā (the experiencer) due to the limitations imposed by the antaḥkaraṇa.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣadic sentences like <em>tat tvam asi</em> teach the essential identity between the jīva and Brahman, as pure consciousness, after eliminating their adventitious qualities.</p>
			<p>Śaṅkara does accept kramamukti or gradual liberation of the jīva after death, by travelling through the Devayāna, to Brahmaloka, as described in the Upaniṣads and the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>. However, he is emphatic about sadyomukti or instant liberation, here and now, simultaneously with the rising of jñāna or knowledge. Such a mukti is also called jīvanmukti, liberation even while living.</p>
			<h2>Rāmānuja</h2>
			<p>Rāmānuja&#x2019;s commentary on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> is known as <em>Śrībhāṣya</em>. Apart from this, he has also composed two more, smaller, works on the <em>Brahma-sūtras</em>, the <em>Vedāntadīpa</em> and the <em>Vedānta-sāra</em>. The former, being a later work, contains some additional explanations.</p>
			<p>Rāmānuja&#x2019;s <em>Śrībhāṣya</em> is stated to follow in the footsteps of the more detailed <em>Bodhāyana-vṛtti</em> as also the works of some earlier Vedāntins like Brahmanandī and Dramiḍācārya whose works are not available now.</p>
			<p>Rāmānuja accepts Brahman as the highest and independent reality. However Brahman includes in himself cit (the sentient beings, the jīvas) and acit (the insentient prakṛti or nature). These two are also real, but under the absolute control of Brahman. Brahman—also called Īśvara by him—includes them, is immanent in them and also transcends them. Hence, Rāmānuja&#x2019;s system is called &#x2018;Viśiṣṭādvaita,&#x2019; advaita or non-duality of Brahman, the Absolute, but &#x2018;viśiṣṭa&#x2019; or qualified by cit and acit. It is similar to a tree with branches, leaves and fruits. Though the tree is &#x2018;one,&#x2019; it has internal parts, each part being different from the other parts, the tree itself, however, always remaining as one.</p>
			<p>To Rāmānuja, Brahman is the Supreme Person (Sarveśvara) who is the ruler of all. He is antagonistic to all evil. He possesses infinite auspicious qualities. He is Omniscient and Omnipotent. The creation, subsistence and reabsorption of this world proceed from him.</p>
			<p>Rāmānuja considers the jīva or the individual soul as the spirit different from the body, atomic in size and endowed with jñāna or consciousness which contracts or expands.</p>
			<p>He has a free will. And, the jīvas are infinite in number. Some jīvas called &#x2018;nitya&#x2019; are ever free. Others who are now &#x2018;baddha&#x2019; or bound, can attain mukti through bhakti and prapatti (devotion and surrender) and the grace of God. All the liberated jīvas are similar in nature.</p>
			<p>Spiritual life starts with the performance of the prescribed karmas in the right spirit leading to the purification of the mind. Such a pure jīva becomes fit to practise jñāna and experience his separateness from the body-mind complex. However, it is through bhakti and prapatti that he ultimately attains Brahman through the devayāna and becomes free.</p>
			<h2>Madhva</h2>
			<p>A thorough-going dualist, Madhva has composed 37 works which collectively go by the name <em>Sarvamūla</em>. The short and terse bhāṣya on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, the <em>Aṇubhāṣya</em> a brief treatise on the same, in verses, <em>Nyāyavivaraṇa</em> and the <em>Anuvyākhyāna</em> are the four works on the sūtraprasthāna. His is a philosophy of realism and a monotheistic theology cente-ring on devotion to Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa. </p>
			<p>According to him Brahman, identified with Viṣṇu (Nārāyaṇa) is the independent reality. Prakṛti or matter and the jīvas or souls who are atomic and infinite in number, are coeval realities but entirely dependent on him. Brahman is essentially knowledge and bliss. Though his infinite personality is beyond our conception, out of grace for us, he can take forms which are neither material nor finite. </p>
			<p>Madhva proclaims the theory of pañcabhedas or five eternal differences between Brahman and the jīvas, Brahman and prakṛti, jīvas and prakṛti, jīva and jīva and various objects of prakṛti.</p>
			<p>He categorises the jīvas into three groups: muktiyogyas, nityasaṁsārins and tamoyogyas. The first group is capable of attaining mukti or liberation. The second group, being interested only in the crass pleasures of the world and not a whit in moral regeneration or spiritual elevation, eternally go through the rounds of births and deaths. The third group, the damned sinners that they are, degenerate into lower births and suffer in hell.</p>
			<p>The jīvas get liberation through bhakti and the grace of God. In the state of liberation they are not only freed from suffering but also enjoy positive bliss. Differences among the jīvas, however, persist even in the state of liberation. </p>
			<h2>Bhāskara</h2>
			<p>Bhāskara is the trail-blazer for the post-Śaṅkara schools of Vedānta which did not agree with Śaṅkara&#x2019;s brand of advaita based on māyāvāda, the theory of the unreality of the world. He is a strict Vedāntin in the sense that he takes his stand on the Upaniṣads and the <em>Brahma sūtras</em>. His commentary on the latter expounds his philosophy.</p>
			<p>Bhāskara advocates the acceptance of the direct meaning of all the passages of the Upaniṣads without distinction. He presents a Brahman who has innumerable auspicious attributes, but, without any particular form. He has a twofold power—the bhoktṛśakti (the power of the enjoyer) and the bhogyaśakti (the power of the enjoyed). Using these two powers he transforms himself into the acetana or insentient objects and the jīvas or the sentient souls. Though this transformation is real, it does not affect him in any way. The jīvas in their essential nature are one with Brahman, but get differentiated from him in the state of bondage due to the upādhis or limiting adjuncts—the bodies and the minds—which are real. These upādhis, though real, are not nitya or eternal. They are to be considered as real since they are actually experienced. But, in the state of liberation, they become one with Brahman even as the rivers flowing into the ocean become one with it.</p>
			<p>Bhāskara considers this world as the kāryārūpa or effect, of Brahman, and hence real.</p>
			<p>As regards the sādhana, Bhāskara recommends performance of scripture-ordained duties without desire for their fruits and the practice of meditation on Brahman as also the jīva&#x2019;s oneness with him. Since he does not accept a personal God, there is no place for divine grace in his system.</p>
			<h2>Nimbārka</h2>
			<p>Nimbārka&#x2019;s Dvaitādvaita is very similar to the Bhedābheda of Bhāskara. However, being a firm believer in Brahman with form and attributes and the path of devotion, his philosophy is more akin to that of Rāmānuja.</p>
			<p>Nimbārka&#x2019;s main work is <em>Vedānta-pārijāta-saurabha</em> which is his commentary on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>. It is rather brief but lucid, since he avoids the dialectical methods or a flowery style.</p>
			<p>According to him there are three equally real and co-eternal tattvas or principles: Brahman, cit and acit. While Brahman is the controller or niyantṛ, cit (the sentient being, the jīva or the souls) is the enjoyer, bhoktṛ and acit (the insentient nature, prakṛti) is the enjoyed, bhogya.</p>
			<p>Acit is of three kinds: prākṛta or what is derived from prakṛti or primal matter; aprākṛta or what is not derived from a non-material substance of which the world of Brahman is made and, kāla or time. </p>
			<p>They are different from one another in their svarūpa or nature. But the cit and the acit are paratantra-tattvas, dependent realities. </p>
			<p>Nimbārka adopts the view that the bheda (difference) and the abheda (non-difference) are both equally real. They co-exist but do not contradict each other. It is something like the relationship between the sea and its waves or the sun and its rays. Cit and acit, the souls and the universe, exist in Brahman from all eternity and never get separated from him whether in the casual state or when manifested. They retain their individuality even during salvation or dissolution of the universe.</p>
			<p>Brahman is personal, possesses a celestial body, full of exquisite beauty and grace. Nimbārka identifies him with Kṛṣṇa and posits Rādhā as his Śakti or consort even as Rāmānuja accepts Lakṣmī as the consort of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa.</p>
			<p>Brahman is omniscient, the cause of the origin, sustenance and destruction of the universe. He is all-powerful and yet all-merciful. He is gracious to his devotees and helps them have a direct vision of himself.</p>
			<p>The jīvas are atomic and infinite in number. Each of them is a distinctive agent, a jñatṛ (knower), kartṛ (doer) and bhoktṛ (enjoyer) of the karmas he does. They animate the body they live in, even as a small lamp kept in a room lights up the whole room. </p>
			<p>There are three destinies for the jīvas—naraka or the hell for the sinners, svarga or heaven for the virtuous and apavarga or release for enlightened ones. Apavarga is attaining the world of Brahman from which there is no return.</p>
			<p>Constant meditation on Brahman as the inmost Self of the jīva or the individual soul is the means of attaining Brahman in Brahmaloka. There he has brahma-svarūpa-lābha, becomes similar in nature, except for the power of creation.</p>
			<p>The other sādhanās recommended are: scripture-ordained work, knowledge, devotion and surrender to God, as also strict obedience to the spiritual teacher.</p>
			<h2>Vallabha</h2>
			<p>Vallabha&#x2019;s philosophy is known as Śuddhādvaita. He is said to have written two commentaries on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, the <em>Bṛhadbhāṣya</em> and the <em>Aṇubhāṣya</em>, of which the former is not available now. The latter is up to the 33rd sūtra of the second pāda of the third adhyāya (3.2.33). The book was completed by his son Viṭṭhalanātha. Apart from the prasthānatraya, he holds the <em>Bhāgavata</em> in very high esteem. He wrote a commentary on it also, called <em>Subodhinī</em>, which too remained incomplete.</p>
			<p>For Vallabha, God the Absolute is Kṛṣṇa whom the Upaniṣads call &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019;. He is one without a second and is sat-cit-ānanda, (being, awareness and bliss). He has three forms: Parabrahman, Puruṣottama or Kṛṣṇa; Antaryāmin, the indwelling spirit of all the living beings and Akṣara-brahman which is the object of meditation and the abode of Kṛṣṇa. It is this Akṣara that appears as prakṛti (insentient nature, the matrix of all created objects) and puruṣa (sentient soul, the jīva), but is beyond both. While Puruṣottama is the highest, Akṣara is an expression of his.</p>
			<p>This Akṣara, again, appears in three more forms: kāla (time), karma (action) and svabhāva (nature).</p>
			<p>Kāla or time is suprasensible and is inferred from its effects. It is all-pervasive and the support of all beings. Karma or action is also universal. It manifests itself as different actions of different beings. Svabhāva or nature is that which produces pariṇāma or change.</p>
			<p>God is both saguṇa and nirguṇa (with and without attributes). He cannot be known except through his own grace. Through his māyāśakti, he can become anything at any time. He is both the material and the efficient cause of this world. He creates the world through his own nature and hence the samavāyi-kāraṇa, the inherent cause. Though he exists everywhere in his tripartite nature as being, consciousness and bliss, their manifestation in the created universe differs. Matter reflects only the being aspect (&#x2018;sat&#x2019;), the souls reflect the consciousness also (&#x2018;cit&#x2019;) whereas as Brahman, he manifests all the three fully.</p>
			<p>Though unmanifest and transcendent in his own nature, by creating the world through his will, he becomes manifest and an object of comprehension. Since this world is a manifestation of Brahman, it is never destroyed but is only withdrawn into him at his will.</p>
			<p>The jīvas or individual souls come out of Akṣara Brahman like sparks from fire. They are eternal parts of Brahman and are atomic in size. They are of three classes: puṣṭi, maryāda and pravāha. The first are the chosen ones enjoying the grace of God, and ardently devoted to him. The second study the scriptures, perform the rites prescribed as ordained duties and also cultivate devotion. They attain God in course of time. The last are interested only in the worldly life and hence transmigrate constantly. Some of them, due to satsaṅga or good company, may attain God later. </p>
			<p>Vallabha considers bhakti or devotion as the only means of salvation. By that, the jīva is released from the cycle of birth and death and enjoys the bliss of God in all possible ways.</p>
			<p>Vallabha holds that the knower of Brahman is absorbed in Akṣara-Brahman and not in Puruṣottama. It is only through bhakti that the latter, the highest aspect, can be attained.</p>
			<p>He advocates two forms of bhakti: maryādā-bhakti and puṣṭi-bhakti. The former is formal devotion to be practised as described in the scriptures and has to be cultivated by self-effort. The latter is attained by the grace of God alone, without one&#x2019;s effort. &#x2018;Puṣṭi&#x2019; refers, not to the physical nourishment, but to the spiritual nourishment got by the grace of God. Hence the name &#x2018;puṣṭi-bhakti&#x2019;. Consequently, Vallabha&#x2019;s system is also called &#x2018;Puṣṭi-mārga.&#x2019; Emphasis on the worship of Bālakṛṣṇa, (child Kṛṣṇa) and sevā or service to him, find an important place in the mode of sādhanā taught by him.</p>
			<h2>Baladeva</h2>
			<p>Baladeva is an important teacher of the Bengal school of Vaiṣṇavism developed by Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya (A.D. 1485-1533). The philosophy of this school is known as Acintyabhedābheda.</p>
			<p><em>Govindabhāṣya</em> is his commentary on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, <em>Siddhāntaratna</em> being another work that expounds this philo-sophy. This school, though deeply indebted to the dvaita system of Madhva, also differs from it. </p>
			<p>According to this school of thought, Brahman the highest reality is Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu or Hari. He is the Personal God possessed of infinite auspicious qualities, which are &#x2018;acintya&#x2019; or beyond our comprehension. He is &#x2018;nirguṇa&#x2019; only in the sense that he is beyond the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas. The scriptures are the only authority to reveal him.</p>
			<p>God has three powers: parāśakti (higher power), aparāśakti (lower power) and avidyāśakti (nescience power). Through the first, he becomes the efficient cause, and, through the other two, the material cause. When the latter two powers are manifested in gross forms, the universe of souls and matter arises. </p>
			<p>Creation of the world is a spontan-eous act of the Lord. However, he does it as per the karmas of the individual souls.</p>
			<p>The individual soul is eternal. It is both knowledge and knower, an enjoyer and an active agent, though not independent. It is atomic in size.</p>
			<p>Bhakti is the sole and direct cause of salvation. Though dhyāna or upāsanā (meditation) is one form of bhakti, it is through premābhakti (intense devotion) that God can be realised. Performance of duties purifies the mind. Study of the scriptures is an aid in the path of sādhanā. However, it is ultimately by the grace of God alone that he can be realised and salvation attained. The freed soul resides in the same world as the Lord and in his proximity, attains his nature and attributes. However, it retains its separate identity.</p>
			<p>Baladeva does not admit of jīvanmukti or liberation while living in the body here.</p>
			<h3>The Brahmasūtra Literature</h3>
			<p>Being the basic text of Vedānta, both in its metaphysical and and in its dialectical aspect, the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> has attracted the attention of a host of elite scholars over the centuries. Apart from the direct bhāṣyas by the great ācāryas, several subcommentaries and glosses over them have enriched the Brahmasūtra literature. In such literature now available to us, the maximum number of works belong to the Advaita school. </p>
			<p>On the Śāṅkarabhāṣya, three ṭīkās or subcommentaries are available in full: <em>Bhāmati</em> of Vācaspatimiśra (A. D. 840), <em>Nyāyanirṇaya</em> of Ānandagiri (A. D. 1260) and <em>Ratnaprabhā</em> of Rāmānanda (17th century).</p>
			<p>The one by Padmapāda (A. D. 820), a direct disciple of Śaṅkara, called <em>Pañca-pādikā</em> deals with the first four sūtras (1.1.1-4) only. This was commentated upon by Prakāśātman (A. D. 1200) in his <em>Pañcapādikā-vivaraṇam</em>. There is a gloss on this called <em>Tattvadīpanam</em> by Akhaṇḍā-nanda Muni (A. D. 1350). All these commen-taries collectively, have created the <em>Viva-raṇa-prasthāna</em>, a special school of Advaita Vedānta, in the post-Śaṅkara period.</p>
			<p>As opposed to this, the <em>Bhāmatī-prasthāna</em> was developed by Amalānanda (13th century A. D.) in his <em>Kalpataru</em> on the <em>Bhāmatī</em> and Appayya-dīkṣita (16th century A. D.) in his <em>Parimalā</em>, on this <em>Kalpataru</em>.</p>
			<p>Mention may also be made of a few other works on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, con-sidered to be more important than others: <em>Saṅkṣepaśārīrakam</em> of Sarvajñatma Muni (A. D. 900), <em>Vivaraṇaprameya-saṅgraha</em> of Vidyāraṇya (A. D. 1350), <em>Brahmasūtra-dīpikā</em> of Śaṅkarānanda (14th century A. D.) and <em>Brahmatattvaprakāśikā</em> of Sadāśiva-brahmendra (18th century A. D.).</p>
			<p>Comparatively speaking, the Brahma-sūtra literature of the other schools of Vedānta, is not so voluminous though it is in no way inferior in its quality and its erudition.</p>
			<p>After creating his <em>magnum opus</em>, the <em>Śrībhāṣya</em>, Rāmānuja wrote two more treatises on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> entitled <em>Vedāntadīpa</em> and <em>Vedāntasāra</em>. The <em>Śrībhāṣya</em> has only one ancient commentary the <em>Śrutaprakāśikā</em> of Sudarśanasūri (13th cent. A. D.) On this, Vedāntadeśika (A. D. 1268-1369) wrote a gloss called <em>Tattvaṭīkā</em>.</p>
			<p>Apart from his bhāṣya (generally called the Madhvabhāṣya) on the <em>Brahma-sūtras</em>, Madhva wrote the <em>Aṇubhāṣya</em> in verses, giving the gist of the various adhikaraṇas of the work. Rāghavendra-tīrtha (A. D. 1598-1671) has written an extensive commentary on this and has named it <em>Tattvamañjarī</em>.</p>
			<p>Trivikrama Paṇḍita, a disciple of Madhva, has commented upon the bhāṣya of Madhva. It is called the <em>Tattvadīpikā</em>. <em>Tattvaprakāśika</em> of Jayatīrtha (A. D. 1365-1388) and <em>Tātparyacandrikā</em> of Vyāsarāya (A. D. 1481) are the other commentaries on the same.</p>
			<p>However, the most celebrated work of the Dvaita school of Madhva is the <em>Nyāyasudhā</em> of Jayatīrtha which is a highly dialectical and yet lucid commentary on Madhva&#x2019;s <em>Anuvyākhyāna</em>, a work elucidating his own commentary on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>.</p>
			<p>Nimbārka&#x2019;s commentary on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>, known as the <em>Vedānta-pārijāta-saurabha</em>, has been expounded further by Srīnivāsa (13th cent. A. D.) in his <em>Vedānta-kaustubha</em> which again has been explained further by Keśava Kāśmīrin (15th cent. A. D.) in his <em>Vedānta-kaustubha-prabhā</em>.</p>
			<p>The other commentaries which have drawn the attention of the Vedāntic scholars are the <em>Vijñānāmṛta-bhāṣya</em> of Vijñāna-bhikṣu (A. D. 1550) and the commentary <em>Sūkṣma</em> on Baladeva&#x2019;s <em>Govinda-bhāṣya</em>.</p>
			<p>Apart from these works mentioned here, there are several other treatises and tracts on the various aspects of Vedānta as interpreted by the numerous schools.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>There is no gainsaying the fact that the Vedānta system based chiefly on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>—which itself is a systematic exposition of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads—has influenced all the important aspects of Hindu religion and culture, including the modern Hindu movements.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Bhāgavata</em> occupies a pre-eminent place not only among the purāṇas but also among the general scriptures of Hinduism on its own. It is a gospel of divine life and is not a textbook of systematic philosophy.</p>
			<p>Its teaching has a theoretical as well as a practical aspect. The former is known as Brahmavāda and the latter as Bhāgavata-dharma.</p>
			<p>The essence of Brahmavāda is that Brahman or Ātman is the only Absolute Reality. The whole universe, including our body, mind and ego, is only an expression in name and form of that Brahman. However, this view differs from pantheism in that Brahman does not exhaust himself in the manifestation of this universe. He is neither limited nor affected in any way by the phenomenal universe. And yet, he is both immanent and transcendent.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the woman who speaks about Brahman&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>In the ancient days, women were divided into two classes: the brahma-vādinīs and the sadyovadhūs.</p>
			<p>The brahmavādinīs underwent the sacrament of upanayana, kept the Vedic fires, studied the Vedas under their own father and lived by begging the food, also under the parental roof. They had samā-vartana (valedictory rite at the end of the period of Vedic studies) also. They could then marry and settle down in life.</p>
			<p>The name &#x2018;brahmavādinī&#x2019; seems to have been given due to the fact that the girl could recite (vad = to speak or recite) the Vedas (Brahma = Veda). It might also have been applied to those women who were interested in discussing about Brahman, the Absolute, and perform spiritual practices to realize the same. May be due to this reason that the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> (4.5.1) calls Maitreyī, wife of the sage Yājñavalkya, as a &#x2018;brahmavādinī&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Sadyovadhūs&#x2019; were those who became vadhūs or brides straight-away, (sadyas = at once) on the attainment of puberty, without undergoing the training in the Vedic studies. In their case, the upanayana ceremony was performed just before marriage, as a formality.</p>
			<p>The practice of performing upanayana for women as also teaching them the Vedas, seems to have disappeared even by the time of the <em>Manusmṛti</em> (composed much earlier than A. D. 200).</p>
			<p>The word brahmavādinī is sometimes applied to the famous Gayatrīmantra also.</p>

			<word>Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Modern Hinduism, though rooted in the Vedas and the Vedānta, is deeply influenced by the purāṇas, at least on the practical side. The <em>Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa</em> is one such that is often quoted by the writers of the dharmaśāstras while dealing with topics like castes, gifts, vratas (religious vows during festival days), descriptions of narakas or hells for transgression of dharma and so on. The original part of the purāṇa may be ancient. However, the extant edition, as available in print, seems to have evolved over the period A. D. 800-1600.</p>
			<p>It is probable that this purāṇa may have acquired this title because it treats this created world as only a vivarta of or an appearance in Brahman, the Absolute.</p>
			<p>It is a fairly voluminous work comprising 18,000 verses spread over four khaṇḍas or books, the total number of chapters being 276.</p>
			<p>The first book called <em>Brahmakhaṇḍa</em> lauds this purāṇa and also gives a gist of the contents of the entire work. It declares that it is Śrī Kṛṣṇa who is the creator of the entire universe and that his world, the Goloka, is the highest of all the divine abodes, even Vaikuṇṭha and Kailāsa being inferior to it. A detailed account of creation which includes the emanation of other deities like Nārāyaṇa, Śaṅkara or Śiva, Brahmā and Dharma-puruṣa, as also the goddesses like Mūrti, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī, Durgā and Sāvitrī is also given. Other topics dealt with in this book include Āyurveda, (science of health) worship of Śālagrāma (the stone symbol of Viṣṇu), austerities to be practised by the saṁnyāsins and widows, philosophical teachings concerning the ultimate identity of the jīva (individual soul) with Brahman and a description of the Goloka.</p>
			<p><em>Prakṛtikhaṇḍa</em>, the second book, deals with the mūlaprakṛti or the Mother Nature, who is pictured as the consort of God, forming the left part of his body as it were. She evolves into five goddesses: Rādha and Durgā, Lakṣmī and Sarasvatī as also Sāvitrī. God or Puruṣa splits himself into Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Nārāyaṇa. Later, Brahmā and Śiva also emanate from him.</p>
			<p>Mūlaprakṛti gives birth to a golden egg from which emerges Mahāvirāṭ, the Cosmic Being. He creates the worlds.</p>
			<p>As in the previous khaṇḍa, here also a number of miscellaneous subjects have been dealt with: stories of various female deities including the river-goddesses, worship and meditation concerning Bhūmi or Mother Earth, merits of a bath in the Gaṅgā River, importance of the tuḷasī leaves and rules concerning its use, details of the various śālagrāma stones, the well-known story of Sāvitrī and Satyavān, karma and its effects, descriptions of narakas or hells, detailed information about the growth of the human foetus in the womb, story of Durgā in brief as also some details about her worship.</p>
			<p>Next comes <em>Gaṇapatikhaṇḍa</em>. This book deals mainly with the birth and exploits of Gaṇapati and Ṣaṇmukha, the two sons of Śiva and Pārvatī. The story of Paraśurāma (the Rāma of the battle-axe) is also an important part of this section. There are quite a few beautiful hymns in praise of Gaṇapati.</p>
			<p><em>Śrī-Kṛṣṇa-janma-khaṇḍa</em>, the last book, is also the biggest. Though the story of Kṛṣṇa follows the one given in the <em>Bhāgavata</em>, the amorous deeds of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are portrayed prominently. Stories of Ambarīṣa and Durvāsa, Aṣṭāvakra and Śrī Rāma also find a place. A variety of topics like the evil omens indicated by bad dreams, duties of the people belonging to the four varṇas, special code of conduct for the widows, foods fit and unfit for consuming, description of Kaliyuga or the Iron Age, greatness of the country of Bhārata and the science of architecture are also included at appropriate places. </p>
			<p>The last chapter of this book gives a list of eighteen major purāṇas along with the total number of verses in each of them.</p>
			<p>A special feature of this purāṇa is that it gives several important mantras (esoteric formulae) as also their usage.</p>

			<word>brahmavidyā </word>
			<note>(&#x2018;knowledge of Brahman&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The words Brahman and Ātman are extensively used in the Hindu scriptures.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019; has several senses: God the Absolute, the Vedas, a brāhmaṇa, the Brahmā-priest in a Vedic sacrifice as also tapas or austerity. However, it is in the first sense that it is more widely used.</p>
			<p>Vidyā means knowledge, wisdom, an art or a science. Hence brahmavidyā refers to that art or science or discipline by practising which, one is able to attain Brahman or God the Absolute.</p>
			<p>This brahmavidyā is very ancient and has a hoary tradition. According to the Upaniṣads, Brahmā, the Creator, was himself the first teacher. It has been handed down to us by a galaxy of successive teachers.</p>
			<p>One who aspires for brahmavidyā should first cultivate the sādhana-catuṣṭaya or the fourfold spiritual discipline, like viveka (discrimination) and vairāgya (renunciation). (See also <ref>SĀDHANACATUṢṬAYA</ref> for details.) Tapas (austerity) and devotion to the spiritual preceptor are other aspects of this discipline.</p>
			<p>The teacher of brahmavidyā should be a śrotriya (well-versed in the scriptures) and a brahmaniṣṭha (established in Brahman). It is obligatory on his part to impart that knowledge to one qualified for it, if he requests for the same.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;brahmavidyā&#x2019; is sometimes applied to the knowledge of the Vedas and their subsidiary sciences, since Vedas are also known as Brahman.</p>

			<word>Brahmavidyā Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is one of the minor Upaniṣads belonging to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>. It is a fairly large work of 110 ślokas or verses in the anuṣṭubh meter. The Praṇava or Oṅkāra as also the Haṁsamantra (<em>so&#x2019;haṁ</em> <em>haṁsaḥ</em>) are the main topics dealt with. However, the several details that are given, concerning the various aspects of meditation on these two mantras, make the work quite recondite.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad starts with an exposition of Praṇava, its four parts and contem-plations connected with them. Just as the sound of a gong or a bell, made of bell-metal, gradually gets attenuated, finally merging into the infinite sound or infinite silence, the mind of a yogi who utters the Praṇava (Oṁ), lengthening it over sixteen mātrās or instants of time, simultaneously concentrating his mind on that sound, also gets dissolved in Brahman, the final goal of praṇava-japa.</p>
			<p><em>Haṁsavidyā</em> is the next topic taken up. The words &#x2018;haṁ&#x2019; and &#x2018;saḥ&#x2019; represent the jīvātman (the individual self) and Parmātman or Brahman (the Supreme Self) respectively. The natural breathing process of inhalation and exhalation should be mentally connected with the two words &#x2018;haṁ&#x2019; and &#x2018;saḥ&#x2019;. Then the process of breathing itself gets converted into japa (repetition of divine name) ultimately resulting in the experience of the unity of the two. This is <em>Haṁsavidyā</em>.</p>
			<p>After stressing that the ātman can be known only through the śruti (the scripture or the Vedas) and the ācārya (spiritual preceptor), the Upaniṣad goes on to describe three types of ācāryas—the codaka, the bodhaka and the mokṣada. Codaka is actually the Vedas which impel a person to take to the spiritual path. The bodhaka is the teacher who teaches the disciple, &#x2018;Thou art That.&#x2019; Mokṣada (giver of liberation) is the Lord himself, since it is only he that can give mokṣa or liberation.</p>
			<p>Here, the Upaniṣad declares that it is in the heart alone that one realises this &#x2018;Haṁsa&#x2019; or the Lord who is the indwelling spirit.</p>
			<p>The work concludes with a long, highly poetical, soliloquy by the knower of the Self, the gist of which is that he exists in all and is all.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Out of the ṣodaśa-saṁskāras or sixteen sacraments recommended in the dharmaśāstras for the dvijas (the &#x2018;twice-born&#x2019;) vivāha or marriage is considered not only very important but also basic, since all the other sacraments depend on it.</p>
			<p>Out of the eight forms of marriage listed in the works, the brāhma is the best. It is called &#x2018;brāhma&#x2019; since it is sanctioned by the Vedas (Brahma = the Veda) or, is in accordance with dharma (Brahma = dharma), the moral law sanctioned by the holy books and sacred traditions.</p>
			<p>In this form of marriage, the father of the girl bedecks her with the best of clothes and ornaments and gifts her to a worthy young man, learned in the Vedas and of good character. Before doing so, the bridegroom is invited and honored properly.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;sacrifice unto Brahman&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Every gṛhastha or householder was expected to perform five yajñas or sacrifices everyday. They were called &#x2018;pañcamahāyajñas&#x2019;. They had nothing to do with the śrauta or the Vedic sacrifices wherein oblations had to be poured into the duly consecrated Vedic fires, but were of the nature of performing certain obligatory duties.</p>
			<p>Brahmayajña is one of them. Here, Brahma means the Vedas and brahmayajña means recitation of the Vedic texts as prescribed by the dharmaśāstras.</p>
			<p>In the <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> (11.5.6. 3-8) there is an interesting comparison of the various limbs and functions of the body involved in reciting the Vedas, with the implements used in a sacrifice. For instance, the various spoons and ladles like juhū, upabhṛt and dhruvā are symboli-cally represented by the speech, the mind and the eyes. The conclusion of the Vedic chanting in the brahmayajña is avabhṛtha-snāna or the ceremonial bath at the end of a sacrifice.</p>
			<p>Brahmayajña may be performed either in a quiet place outside the village or in one&#x2019;s own house. The usual practice is to do it during the sandhyā or at noon. After sitting on the seat and performing ācamana (ceremonial sipping of water) certain prescribed Vedic texts are to be chanted. Generally, it is one&#x2019;s own branch of the Veda studied in the gurukula. Other works mentioned for svādhyāya (self-study) during brahmayajña are: the four Vedas, the Brāhmaṇas, the Kalpas, the itihāsas and purāṇas.</p>
			<p>The contents of the brahmayajña varies from one śākhā (branch of the Vedas) to another. However, the Gāyatrī-mantra, the <em>Puruṣasūkta</em> and the śānti-mantra &#x2018;Oṁ namo brahmaṇe....&#x2019; seem to find a place in almost all these traditions.</p>
			<p>Now-a-days, brahmayajña is rarely performed. However, during the lunar month of Śrāvaṇa (July-August) it is performed once by most brāhmaṇas, especially in South India. A set formula has been adopted which includes the Gāyatrī-mantra, the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (1.1.1-9), the first sentences of <em>Aitareya Āraṇyaka</em>, the <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> and <em>Śukla Yajurvedas</em>, the <em>Sāmaveda</em>, the <em>Atharvaveda</em> as also the first sentences of the six Vedāṅgas. This is followed by the śāntimantra &#x2018;Oṁ namo brahmaṇe&#x2019; and a tarpaṇa (water libation).</p>

			<p>The āgamas and the tantras—a special class of religious literature dealing with the different aspects of Śaivism and Śāktāism—have the unique distinction of integrating the non-Vedic local religious cults into the general framework of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
			<p>The Yāmalas, belonging to the Śaivā-gama group, have, in all probability, derived their name from the fact of their dealing with both Śiva and Śakti (Yamala = twin, couple) in their works. Out of the eight Yāmalas known to exist, the <em> Brahmayāmala</em>, occupies a very important place. According to one version it is said to consist of 22,100 ślokas or verses.</p>
			<p>Īśvara propitiated Lord Śrīkaṇṭha, got this knowledge from him and then communicated the same to his spouse, Pārvatī or Devī.</p>
			<p>The work describes the process of creation from Sadāśiva through his Parāśakti (supreme energy).</p>
			<p>It also traces the origin of the three srotas or currents of tāntric traditions. They are Dakṣiṇa, Vāma and Madhyama. The Dakṣiṇa-srota is characterised by sattva and hence is called &#x2018;śuddha&#x2019;. The Vāma-srota has predominance of rajas and hence is &#x2018;miśra&#x2019;. The last, the Madhyama-srota, is dominated by tamas and so, is described as &#x2018;aśeṣa-mala-rañjita&#x2019; (fully coloured by impurity).</p>
			<p>Some of the gods and sages who promulgated this knowledge of Śiva are: Īśvara, Mahādevī, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Uśanas, Bṛhaspati, Sanatkumāra and Lakulīśa.</p>
			<p>The earliest manuscript of the <em>Brahmayāmala</em> available now is preserved in Nepal and has been assigned the date A. D. 1052. According to it, the eight Yāmalas were communicated by eight Bhairavas such as Svacchanda, Krodha and others. These Yāmalas indicate great developments in the tāntric sādhanās.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Brāhmī is the śakti or power of Brahmā, the creator, considered as his consort. See <ref>BRAHMĀṆĪ</ref> for details.</p>
			<p>Brāhmī is also the name of a script, one of the earliest in recorded history, and, considered as the mother of the devanāgarī script as also the allied scripts, like those of Tibet, Burma, Sri Lanka and Thailand.</p>
			<p>The earliest records available in the Brāhmī script are the edicts of Aśoka. Most of them, except the ones found in the North-West part of India, are in the Brāhmī script. The North-Western edicts are in the Kharoṣṭhī script.</p>
			<p>The Brāhmī is normally read from left to right.</p>
			<p>Regarding its origin there are two theories. Most Indian scholars maintain that it was derived from the Harappan script. Many European scholars believe that it was derived from a Semitic script like the Greek, Aramaic or the Phoenician.</p>
			<p>The Hindu tradition holds that it has come from Brahmā, the Creator, himself; and hence the name Brāhmī. The similarities with the script of Indus valley civilization seem to support the theory of its Indian origin.</p>
			<p>But, one thing is certain: By the time of emperor Aśoka (272-232 B.C.) the script was not only in existence but had also been considerably developed and refined.</p>
			<p>Knowledge of the script had long been forgotten. It goes to the credit of James Prinsep (A. D. 1799-1840) and Kamalākānta Vidyālaṅkāra for the complete decipherment of the script in A.D. 1838.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Brahman is the Absolute from which this universe has evolved, in which it lives and to which it returns at the end of a cycle of creation. It is described as &#x2018;sat-cit-ānanda,&#x2019; existence-knowledge-bliss absolute.</p>
			<p>When a person, through appropriate sādhanās or spiritual practices, realises this Brahman in the inmost depths of his being, his life undergoes a dramatic change, reflecting this inner experience in every action. Such a person called &#x2018;sthitaprajña&#x2019; or &#x2018;a man of steady wisdom&#x2019;, always maintains an equanimous attitude towards all situations of life.</p>
			<p>This inner state of mystical experience resulting from realising Brahman and expressing itself outwardly as equanimity has been called &#x2018;brāhmī-sthiti&#x2019; by the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (2.72). Once attained, this state will continue till the last moment of one&#x2019;s life.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;that which stimulates [a knowledge of] Brahman&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>During the ancient days performance of the Vedic sacrifices was widely prevalent. Though the sacrifices took a lot of time to do them meticulously, intervals and free time would also be there. These had to be utilised in a way useful to the people involved, especially the priests. One such programme that served this purpose well was the &#x2018;brahmodya,&#x2019; a theological dialogue, where questions and riddles were propounded and answered. This helped the priests and others to enrich their knowledge in the company of persons endowed with better knowledge and greater experience. A sample of the same, which occurs in the Aśvamedha sacrifice may be given here: pṛcchāmi paramantaḥ pṛthivyāḥ, .....iyaṁ vediḥ paro antaḥ, &#x2018;I ask you the furthest limit of the earth.....&#x2019; &#x2018;This vedi is the furthest limit.&#x2019; (<em>Ṛgveda</em> 1.164.34,35)</p>

			<word>Brahmopaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Brahmopaniṣad</em> is a minor Upaniṣad and is assigned to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>. There seems to be two recensions—the South Indian and the North Indian. The latter is the longer version.</p>
			<p>Śaunaka approaches the sage Pippa-lāda of the Aṅgiras-gotra and puts him a question regarding the location and functioning of the deities of the indriyas or sense-organs in the divine Brahmapura (the human body). In reply, Pippalāda imparts the excellent Brahmavidyā or spiritual wisdom concerning ātman/ Brahman.</p>
			<p>It is prāṇa or ātman that exercises its power over all the devas or the indriyas (sense-organs). Situated in this Brahma-pura (the human body) it is the pure, resplendent, partless Brahman that controls these sense-organs.</p>
			<p>When the jīva (prāṇa or ātman) goes out of the body during suṣupti or deep sleep, all the sense-organs also follow him even as the bees follow the queen bee. He moves about in sleep like an eagle flying freely in the sky. In this state of suṣupti the jīva is not tainted or affected by good and bad. He comes back to the waking state through the dream state.</p>
			<p>This puruṣa (the jīva or the ātman bound in this body) has four seats where his presence is felt: nābhi (navel), hṛdaya (heart), kaṇṭha (throat) and mūrdhā (head). Associated with the four states of consciousness, viz., jāgrat (waking state), svapna (dream state), suṣupti (deep sleep state) and turīya (the fourth or the super-conscious state), he is known respectively as Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra and Akṣara. But in himself he is pure Light, beyond the limitations of all the sense-organs.</p>
			<p>At the cosmic level, since he is everything and all things are merged in him without distinction, the worlds, the gods, the sacrificial systems, all human relationships and varieties of human beings do not exist separately as distinguished from him.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad then goes on to describe the real meaning of śikhā (tuft of hair) and yajñopavīta (sacred thread) as related to Brahman (the Absolute). The externals should be discarded and jñāna or knowledge (of the ātman) should take their place.</p>
			<p>This is then followed by some verses which appear in other Upaniṣads like the <em>Śvetāśvatara</em> also. They describe the Supreme Lord as the all-pervading reality and also as residing in the hearts of all beings in a subtle form. He is the supreme witness, energiser, master-controller and supervisor. Those who realize him in their own hearts attain eternal happiness, and not the others.</p>
			<p>Just as the fire which is inherent in the araṇis (attritional pieces of wood used in Vedic sacrifices to produce fire) is brought out by their attrition, or oil from the oil-seeds or butter from curds or water from the earth by proper means, the ātman inside us can be brought out, i.e., experienced, through meditation. Once this is done, the jīva or the individual soul is liberated from all types of bondage.</p>

			<word>brahmotsava</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;the big festival&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hindu temples and worship of the images permanently fixed in their garbhagṛha (sanctum sanctorum) are quite ancient. Out of the several public festivals observed by these temples, the &#x2018;brahmot-sava&#x2019; is the biggest. (&#x2018;Brahma&#x2019; means &#x2018;big&#x2019;.) However, the orthodox belief is that the fourfaced Brahmā (the creator-god) himself conducts this festival in honour of the chief deity of the temple. Hence the name &#x2018;brahmotsava&#x2019;. Generally it is the grandest and the most spectacular of all the temple-festivals. The celebrity of a temple is often measured by the extent of the grandeur of its brahmotsava.</p>
			<p>Āgāmic works speak of five varieties of brahmotsavas. They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>brāhma : It is celebrated just for a day and is supposed to increase the spiritual power of the temple.</li>
				<li>śaiva : It is conducted for three days and is aimed at removing all the obstacles of the people.</li>
				<li>aindra : Spread over five days, this is believed to prevent famine and drought.</li>
				<li>ārṣa : Conducted for seven days, this is meant to secure prosperity for the kingdom.</li>
				<li>daivika or vaiṣṇava : This is a nine-day affair purported to bring about all-round protection and happiness.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This last one is considered as sāttvika (pure) as against the others which are either rājasika (middling) or tāmasika (inferior).</p>
			<p>Some of the more important aspects of a brahmotsava are: bherītāḍana (beating the drum), dhvajārohaṇa (hoisting the temple flag), āvāhana (inviting the deity to the yāgaśālā or place of sacrificial rites), establishing of kalaśas (holy pots filled with water) and performance of homas.</p>
			<p>The rathotsava (festival of taking the utsavamūrti or the procession-image in the ratha or temple car) is conducted two days before the close of the festival.</p>
			<p>In some temples where there is the facility of a tank or a river nearby, teppotsava or boat-festival too is celebrated.</p>

			<word>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Out of the three basic scriptures of Hinduism known as the prasthānatraya, the Upaniṣads rank first. In the group of the ten Upaniṣads the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> and the <em>Chāndogya</em> occupy a unique place since they not only delineate the fundamental principles of Vedānta but also describe a number of upāsanās or meditations, technically called <em>Vidyās</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em>, as its very name suggests, is quite a large work (bṛhad = large, big) and forms an integral part of the well-known <em>Śatapatha Brāh-maṇa</em> which itself belongs to the <em>Śukla Yajurveda</em>. The <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> has two recensions—the <em>Kāṇva</em> and the <em>Mādhyandina</em>. The former has 17 kāṇḍas or sections whereas the latter has only 14. The six adhyāyas or chapters of the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> actually form chapters 3 to 8 of the 17th kāṇḍa in the <em>Kāṇva</em> recension and chapters 4 to 9 of the 14th kāṇḍa of the <em>Mādhyandina</em> recension.</p>
			<p>The adhyāyas are divided into khaṇḍas or brāhmaṇas, which again are subdivided into kaṇḍikās (similar to mantras). There are 435 kaṇḍikās distri-buted among the 47 brāhmaṇas of the 6 adhyāyas of this Upaniṣad.</p>
			<p>There is another way of dividing this Upaniṣad. The first two adhyāyas form the <em>Madhukāṇḍa</em>, the middle two, the <em>Munikāṇḍa</em> or the <em>Yājñavalkyakāṇḍa</em> and the last two, <em>Khilakāṇḍa</em>. These kāṇḍas respectively deal with upadeśa (the teaching), upapatti (the argument) and upāsanā (the meditations and rites).</p>
			<p>By far, the <em>Munikāṇḍa</em>, which accounts for almost half the number of the kaṇḍikās, is the most important part of this Upaniṣad. The sage Yājñavalkya, who is the principal person that appears here, has expounded brilliantly the philo-sophy of Ātman/Brahman as also several subtle aspects of related teachings. He can easily be classified among the greatest thinkers of the world of any age.</p>
			<p>A chapterwise summary of the work may now be attempted.</p>
			<h3>First Chapter</h3>
			<p>The first brāhmaṇa known as the <em>Aśva-brāhmaṇa</em>, describes a special process of meditation wherein the various aspects of Prajāpati, the Creator, like kāla (time), loka (the various worlds) and devatā (the various deities) are advised to be superimposed on the different limbs of the horse chosen for the Aśvamedha (horse-sacrifice). This can transform—in a spiritual sense—the horse into Prajāpati himself. The ritual of the Aśvamedha itself can lead the performer to Brahmaloka or the world of Brahmā, also known as Hiraṇyagarbha. Though only kings are competent to perform this sacrifice, even others can attain to the same result by imagining themselves to be the horse and superposing the various items on themselves as described.</p>
			<p><em>Agni-brāhmaṇa</em> is the second section of this chapter. It deals with the manifestation of agni or fire from Prajāpati and the method of contemplation on it as Prajāpati himself. This leads to the fruit of mṛtyujaya or conquest of death.</p>
			<p>The third is the <em>Udgītha-brāhmaṇa</em>. The udgītha is the second and the most important part of a sāman sung by the priest ugdātṛ in a Soma sacrifice. In this brāhmaṇa, the importance of prāṇa, the vital force, has been brought out by an allegorical story. The devas or gods wanted to conquer the asuras or demons by performing the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice. They employed sense-organs like the speech, the eye, the nose, and also the mind to sing the udgītha for them. The asuras, however, succeeded in contaminating them through selfishness, thereby defeating the purpose of the devas. However, when these asuras rushed towards the prāṇa, the chief vital force, they were destroyed. By meditating on one&#x2019;s prāṇa, which is not only the real power behind the sense-organs but also the essence of the Vedas and a replica of the cosmic Prāṇa (also known as Prajāpati or Hiraṇyagarbha) one can attain to the world of Prajāpati. The speciality of this upāsanā or meditation is that it does not involve any rites or rituals.</p>
			<p>The fourth khaṇḍa is known as the <em>Puruṣavidha-brāhmaṇa</em>. Before creation, the entire universe was within the body of Puruṣa or Prajāpati or Virāj, undifferenti-ated from him. He desired for a mate. As a result of his will, he projected out of himself another entity which split into two, the male part being Manu and the female Śatarūpā. By their union, not only in the human form, but also in various other forms, all the living beings, up to an ant, were created. He, however, remained as he was, unaffected. He then realized that the created universe of beings was also himself. Later, he created the gods like Agni.</p>
			<p>Since the Puruṣa, the Supreme Self, has entered into the whole creation and exists in it like a sword in its sheath or fire in the wood, it is he who is being manifested through all the activities of the body-mind complex. However, the activities like speaking and the names like speech, are only nomenclatures born out of the various types of functioning. He is the inmost self in us and is unaffected by the sense of doership or actions or their fruits, which have been superimposed on him by avidyā or ignorance of his real nature. The sage Vāmadeva and many others like him, realized that they were in the ultimate analysis, the Supreme Self.</p>
			<p>Then comes a classification of the gods. Agni is brāhmaṇa. Indra, Varuṇa, Soma, Yama and Īśāna are kṣattriyas. Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas are vaiśyas. Pūṣan is a śūdra. The human beings were born out of these four classes of gods. The Puruṣa or the Supreme Being also created dharma or righteousness (the Cosmic Law) to regulate them all. However, it is declared that an ajñāni or an ignorant person becomes an object of enjoyment for all. These ignorant ones are advised to discharge their debts to the gods and the others through the pañcayajñas or the five daily sacrifices. The Upaniṣad also says that it is desire that binds a person and it is meditation on the Ātman or the Self alone that can deliver him. One who fails in this has to suffer much.</p>
			<p>The next khaṇḍa is known as the <em>Saptānna-brāhmaṇa</em>, the brāhmaṇa of seven foods. The first anna or food is the usual physical food upon which all living beings sustain themselves. Human beings have to consume food so that they can perform the prescribed religious rites which can give them the unseen results later on. If they do not perform these rites, they will be eating only sin. The second and the third annas are the huta and the prahuta sacrificial oblations and gifts given during the sacrifices. They are sometimes, identified with the two sacrifices Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa, meant for the gods. Milk is the fourth anna, specially meant for the animals.</p>
			<p>The last three annas or foods, were kept by Prajāpati for himself. They are: vāk (speech), manas (mind) and prāṇa (vital force). Since they help him to create the worlds and sustain them, they are called &#x2018;anna&#x2019;. These three are then identi-fied with the three worlds, the three Vedas, the three beings (gods, manes and human beings) and so on. In fact they comprise the whole world. One who meditates upon them as limited, attains the finite world. If he meditates upon them as unlimited, he obtains the infinite world.</p>
			<p>This Prajāpati or the Hiraṇyagarbha is himself the time. The Upaniṣad des-cribes how the various organs like vāk or speech, competed against one another but were overcome by fatigue. However, prāṇa or the vital force was not affected by it. Hence, the organs identified themselves with it and became immortal. Among the gods like Agni (fire), Āditya (Sun) and Candra (Moon), only Vāyu (air), the cosmic counterpart of prāṇa, could sustain itself in its work. If a person can meditate on the organs like speech which exist in all living beings and the elements like fire, which exist in this world, as identified with his own Self, he attains identity with Hiraṇyagarbha and live in his world.</p>
			<p>The sixth and the last khaṇḍa, which is sometimes called the <em>Uktha-brāhmaṇa</em>, declares that the whole universe is nothing but nāma (name), rūpa (form) and karma (action). Like the three mutually supporting sticks, these three support one another and also help in manifesting one another. Since this universe is only an upādhi or limiting adjunct to Paramātman (the Supreme Self), anyone who is interested in it, will not be inclined to meditate on him.</p>
			<h3>Second Chapter</h3>
			<p>This chapter, comprising six brāhma-ṇas, is more directly concerned with ātma-tattva or the knowledge of the Ātman. The well-known discourse by the great sage Yājñavalkya to his wife Maitreyī—which, incidentally, appears in the fourth chapter also, though shorter—forms the core of this chapter.</p>
			<p>The first brāhmaṇa known as the <em>Ajātaśatru-brāhmaṇa</em> starts with the legend of Bālāki the proud one, a descendant of Garga and Ajātaśatru, the king of Kāśī. Bālāki proposed to Ajātaśatru to teach Brahman. However, what he taught was elementary and concerned only with the conditioned Brahman, like the Being resid-ing in the sun, the moon, the lightning, the ether, the air and so on. But Ajātaśatru knew better. He had realized the uncondi-tioned Brahman. So, he taught this to Bālāki. In deep sleep, all the sense organs like speech, are absorbed in their sources, the individual Self is merged in the Supreme Self, the unconditioned Brahman. It then resembles a child or a great king or a worthy brāhmaṇa, having reached the acme of bliss. The teaching ends with a statement that all the beings, all the worlds and all the gods emerge out of the Ātman, the Supreme Being, even as sparks spring from fire.</p>
			<p>The next the <em>Śiśu-brāhmaṇa</em> and it speaks of the prāṇa or the vital force as a calf. Its body is its abode, the head is its special place, the vigour generated by food and drink is its post and the food itself is its tether. Seven deities like Rudra and Āditya are praising this prāṇa. One who knows thus, will never be without food.</p>
			<p>The third is the <em>Mūrtāmūrta-brāh-maṇa</em> and it is devoted to the description of the two forms of Brahman. One form is gross, mortal, limited and perceptible. The other is subtle, immortal, unlimited and imperceptible. By superimposing these two forms, the Supreme Brahman is made conceivable. The words &#x2018;neti, neti&#x2019; (&#x2018;not this, not this&#x2019;) deny all limitations to Brahman and reveal its essential nature.</p>
			<p>Next comes the <em>Maitreyī-brāhmaṇa</em> which starts with the story of Yājñavalkya and his two wives, Maitreyī and Kātyā-yanī. It stresses the need for saṁnyāsa or monastic life, to attain the Self. The sage Yājñavalkya, intending to embrace the monastic life, wants to divide his wealth between the two wives. However, Maitreyī, after learning that the wealth, and the Vedic rites performed with the help of wealth, cannot give her immortality, rejects the offer of wealth and opts for ātmajñāna or the knowledge of the Self. Yājñavalkya responds by teaching her that all the beings here like the husband or the wife or the children, as also wealth or the various worlds or the gods are dear to us only because of the Ātman or the Self in them and not by themselves. This Ātman has to be heard of (from a qualified teacher), reflected upon and meditated upon—these three being called śravaṇa, manana and nidi-dhyāsana—in order to be realized. As it is not possible to grasp the special sources of a drum or a conch or a lute without the grasping of sound in general, it is not possible to perceive anything in this world as different from Brahman, its basic reality. Yājñavalkya further asserts that even the Vedas have emerged out of it and that it exists in everything as homogeneous consciousness, even as salt exists everywhere in the water in which it has been dissolved. Perception of duality in this world is only apparent and has been caused by avidyā or ignorance of the Reality.</p>
			<p><em>Madhu-brāhmaṇa</em>, the fifth section, sums up the import of the first two chapters. There is an elaborate account of the Ātman or the Self which is the ruler and the king of all beings. Even as spokes are fixed in the nave and the rim of a chariot wheel, so are all beings, all gods and all worlds are fixed in the Supreme Self. The Sage Dadhyaṅ Ātharvaṇa taught this knowledge of the Self to the two Aśvins—the twin gods—through a temporary equine head. The brāhmaṇa ends with the essential teaching of all the Vedānta texts, viz., that the Self, though one, is perceived as manifold through māyā his inscrutable power.</p>
			<p><em>Vaṁśa-brāhmaṇa</em>, the last section of this chapter, gives the line of teachers beginning with Hiraṇyagarbha.</p>
			<h3>Third Chapter</h3>
			<p>Whereas the <em>Madhukāṇḍa</em>, comprising the first two chapters dealt with upadeśa or āgama (the teachings), the <em>Munikāṇḍa</em> (also called <em>Yājñavalkīya-kāṇḍa</em>) consisting of the third and the fourth chapters, strengthens it through upapatti or yukti, or reasoning. There are nine brāhmaṇas in the third chapter.</p>
			<p>The first is the <em>Aśvala-brāhmaṇa</em>. It starts with an interesting story. Janaka Vaideha, the great king, had just completed a big sacrifice—the Bahudakṣiṇa—to participate in which, a large number of brāhmaṇas from the countries of Kuru and Pañcāla had come. The King proposed to give away as a gift, a thousand cows on the horns of each of which had been tied ten gold coins, to the Brahmiṣṭha (the most learned in Brahman or the Vedas) among them. Though none of the assembled dared to accept the challenge, Yājñavalkya did. He even ordered his disciple Sāmaśrava to drive the cattle home! Naturally the assembly fell into a rage and all started questioning him. Aśvala who was the first to pose eight questions to him, was easily vanquished by the satisfactory replies of Yājñavalkya.</p>
			<p>The <em>Ārtabhāga-brāhmaṇa</em>, the next section, starts with another Vedic scholar, Ārtabhāga, shooting six questions at Yājñavalkya who answers them all to the satisfaction of the questioner. The last of these questions deals with the problem of the destination of the soul of a dead person. Yājñavalkya takes Ārtabhāga to a secluded place and the two finally conclude that it is karma that decides the future life of the soul of a dead person. Good karma leads to noble births and bad karma to ignoble ones.</p>
			<p><em>Bhujyu-brāhmaṇa</em>, the third, states that even the best of karmas or rites results in transmigration and that even karmas accompanied by upāsanā or meditation cannot give mokṣa or freedom.</p>
			<p>The fourth is the <em>Uṣasta-brāhmaṇa</em>. Uṣasta questions Yājñavalkya to tell him about Brahman which is sākṣāt (immediate) and aparokṣāt (direct). Yājñavalkya replies that it is the Ātman that works in the body through the five prāṇas or vital-airs. It is the seer and the knower and hence it cannot be seen or known like an external object.</p>
			<p>The <em>Kahola-brāhmaṇa</em> follows next. A further description of the Ātman is given here, as beyond hunger, thirst, sorrow, delusion, old-age and death. The wise ones realize this Ātman and give up their desire for progeny, wealth and meritorious worlds. A realized soul is a realized soul irrespective of his conduct. His brahma-jñāna or knowledge of Brahman never ceases.</p>
			<p>The sixth section, named <em>Gārgī-brāhmaṇa</em>, deals with the questions posed by Gārgī, the daughter of Vacaknu, and the ready answers given by Yājñavalkya. The questions concerned with the relative subtlety of the pañcabhūtas or the five elements as also the worlds right up to the Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahman. When she asks, &#x2018;By what is the Brahma-loka pervaded?&#x2019; Yājñavalkya warns her not to proceed further since the nature of Brahman can be known only through the scriptures and the preceptor and never through logic or inference.</p>
			<p>The <em>Antaryāmi-brāhmaṇa</em> is the seventh in the series. It is now the turn of Uddālaka Āruṇi to question Yājña-valkya. It concerns the &#x2018;antaratama-sūtra&#x2019; or the inmost thread that passes through all the worlds and all the beings, holding them together. Uddālaka also asks about the Antaryāmin, the Being that dwells in all and controls them all. Yājñavalkya replies that Vāyu is that sūtra or thread. It is the Ātman that indwells all the worlds and all the beings. He resides in them and controls them whereas they know him not. He is the sākṣin or the eternal witness, the śrotṛ or the listener, the mantṛ or the thinker and the jñātṛ or the knower. However, he is not the object of cognition for any of the senses. He is the immortal Ātman. All else is perishable.</p>
			<p>This is followed by the <em>Akṣara-brāhmaṇa,</em> the eighth section, wherein Gārgī puts two questions to Yājñavalkya. The first question is: &#x2018;What pervades that (the sūtra) which is above heaven and below the earth as well as between them, and which was, is and will be?&#x2019; Yājña-valkya replies that it is ākāśa, the unmanifested ether. In reply to her next question as to what pervades this ākāśa also, he answers that it is Akṣara, the indestructible. He describes it through several words revealing its unique qualities: It is asthūla (not gross), anaṇu (not fine), ahrasva (not short), adīrgha (not long), atamaḥ (not darkness), anākāśam (not ether), acakṣuṣkam (without eyes), aprāṇam (without the vital force), amanaḥ (without mind) and so on.</p>
			<p>It can be described only by such negative attributes since it can never be apprehended either by the senses or by the mind.</p>
			<p>Yājñavalkya further avers that, verily under the command of this Akṣara (the Absolute) only the sun, the moon and all the heavenly bodies are held in their positions and perform their allotted duties. Rivers and mountains, quarters and directions and even time itself, keep to their duties. It is by the rule of this very Absolute that the lives of the human beings and the gods in heaven are being regulated.</p>
			<p>He concludes by saying that the performance of any rite or ritual without knowing this Akṣara is a waste and that the condition of one who leaves this world without realizing this Akṣara will be miserable. But the one who leaves this world after knowing this Akṣara will be a knower of Brahman.</p>
			<p><em>Śākalya-brāhmaṇa</em> is the last section of this chapter . It conveys the immediacy and directness of Brahman by a reference to the different enumerations of the gods who are ruled by it. In reply to Śākalya&#x2019;s question about the number of gods Yājñavalkya says that though there are tens or hundreds or thousands of gods they are the manifestations of but one God, Hiraṇyagarbha, who is the cosmic aspect of prāṇa or the vital force. This God is one and at the same time, the many. Hence, when the upāsaka (the worshipper) gets identified with Hiraṇyagarbha, he becomes all, the Self of all.</p>
			<p>Finally Yājñavalkya asks the assembled brāhmaṇas whether they know the root from which a dead person is reborn, even as a tree that is cut off, springs up again from the original root. They were ignorant of it. The Upaniṣad itself declares that this root is Brahman, the consciousness and the bliss, the ultimate resort of all the human beings, be they the performers of rituals or the knower of Brahman.</p>
			<h3>Fourth Chapter</h3>
			<p>This chapter comprises six brāhmaṇas. In the first, known as the <em>Ṣaḍācārya-brāhmaṇa</em>, Yājñavalkya poses some questions to the king Janaka Vaideha. The king in his reply states the characteristics of Brahman as he had learnt from six of his teachers. He posits Agni, Vāyu, Āditya, Digdevatā, Candra and Prajāpati, the presiding deities of speech, vital air, eyes, ears, mind and intellect, as Brahman. Yājñavalkya rules them out as only partial manifestations of Brahman.</p>
			<p>In the <em>Kūrca-brāhmaṇa</em>, the second, Yājñavalkya describes the avasthātraya or the three states of consciousness which the embodied ātman experiences. Jāgrat (waking state), svapna (dream state) and suṣupti (deep-sleep state) are the three states and the soul while associated with these three states is designated as Viśva (or Vaiśvānara), Taijasa and Prājña. Though the terms used in this section are different, the interpretation given by the commentators leads us to this conclusion.</p>
			<p>The third section is the <em>Jyotir-brāhmaṇa</em>, a fairly voluminous one, comprising 38 kaṇḍikas. The avasthātraya or the three states of consciousness, mentioned in the previous brāhmaṇa, is discussed in detail through yukti or logic and reasoning. For an ordinary human being endowed with the body and the senses, what is it that acts as a jyoti or light?—This is the question that Janaka repeatedly asks Yājñavalkya. Yājñavalkya lists them one by one as: the sun, the moon, fire, speech and ātman or the Self. When questioned about this ātman, associ-ated with the body and the senses, Yājñavalkya says that as a large fish swims alternately to both banks of a river, so this ātman, simulating the intellect, moves between the dream world and the waking world. Since the intellect is transparent and next to the ātman, it easily reflects the consciousness of the latter. Like a crystal glowing in the light of a lamp, the intellect also, though bereft of consciousness, appears to shine by the light or consciousness of the ātman, which alone is self-luminous. in fact the luminaries like the sun and the moon are able to shine only by the light of the ātman.</p>
			<p>Then follows the conception of dream according to the Vedānta. In the dream state, the Self puts aside the gross body of the waking state and creates a dream-body comprising the impressions of the waking state. Dreams are not new experi-ences of the waking state. Sometimes they may reflect the experiences of past lives also. The objects of the dream state are then and there created by the mind. Though the Self is dreaming, he has no direct connection with the physical body. Hence it is not advisable to suddenly wake up a sleeping person as that may endanger his life or senses. In dream, the Self merely witnesses the results of good and bad actions but does not actually experience them or do anything.</p>
			<p>The ātman or the Self then enters the samprasāda or the suṣupti state, the state of deep-sleep. He enjoys supreme peace and bliss in this state, since he has merged himself in the Supreme Self. This is the nearest approximation to the state of Brahman. However, avidyā or ignorance does persist even in that state, though in an unmanifested form.</p>
			<p>Then follows a description of the sufferings of an aged or diseased body in order to rouse the spirit of renunciation in us. When the Self leaves the present body it takes up another, made ready by its own past work. This passing of the Self is analogous to the return of man from the dream to the waking state.</p>
			<p>The <em>Śārīraka-brāhmaṇa</em>, the fourth section, gives a detailed description of the transmigration of the jīva or the Self. At the time of death it withdraws its sense-organs and comes to the heart. It then exits through one of the parts of the body. The potential results of upāsanā (meditation), karma (good and bad deeds) and vāsanās (past impressions) follow the jīva in its onward journey. It creates for itself a new body, even as the goldsmith prepares ornaments out of gold. Once the results of past deeds are exhausted, it returns to this world for new work. It should be noted that only a person with desires and cravings transmigrates and not the one who has no cravings. The latter is merged in Brahman, after casting off his body even as a snake casts off its slough. The knowers of Brahman alone become immortal. The others are miserable.</p>
			<p>There is no duality or multiplicity in Brahman. One who sees it otherwise transmigrates from death to death. The seeker of Brahman should not reflect on many words which only cause exhaustion to the vocal cords. He should abjure all vain talk.</p>
			<p>Other teachings given in this section are: The ātman in reality, is unaffected by good or bad deeds. Knowledge of this ātman alone can make a being a &#x2018;muni&#x2019; or a sage. Seekers of liberation desire only the ātman and not the worlds of men, of the manes or of the gods. Hence they renounce their hearth and home and become monks. The ātman cannot be defined in positive terms. At best it can be described negatively as &#x2018;neti&#x2019; (&#x2018;not this&#x2019;). The knower of the ātman is never beset with the thoughts of rewards or punishments for his past actions. He is ever controlled, serene and free from desires. He sees the ātman in himself and all else also as his own Self. He is free from all doubts and evils, ever blessed and absolutely fearless.</p>
			<p>The fifth brāhmaṇa—the <em>Maitreyi-brāhmaṇa</em>—is, for all practical purposes, a repetition of 2.4. The last section—the <em>Vaṁśa-brāhmaṇa</em>—traces the genealogy of the ācāryas or the teachers. As in the <em>Madhukāṇḍa</em>, here also, Hiraṇyagarbha is the primeval teacher.</p>
			<h3>Fifth Chapter</h3>
			<p>With this, begins the <em>Khilakāṇḍa</em>, the &#x2018;supplementary book&#x2019;. The fifth chapter introduces some auxiliary meditations which do not conflict with the rites but lead to worldly well-being and also kramamukti or gradual liberation.</p>
			<p>The first brāhmaṇa starts with the well-known śāntimantra (peace-chant) &#x2018;pūrṇamadaḥ.&#x2019; The infinite universe has come out of the infinite Brahman. Even after realizing its identity with Brahman, Brahman alone is left, because the universe as sopādhika or conditioned Brahman has no real existence. The latter half deals with praṇavopāsana or meditation on Brahman with the Praṇava or Oṅkāra.</p>
			<p><em>Prājāpatya-brāhmaṇa</em>, the second, prescribes the cultivation of the three qualities of dama (self-control), dāna (giving gifts) and dayā (showing compassion) as a part of upāsanā or meditation by means of an interesting parable.</p>
			<p>The third is the <em>Hṛdaya-brāhmaṇa</em> which eulogises the heart, the seat of the intellect. The fourth and the fifth brāh-maṇas enjoin meditations on the hṛdaya-brahman as Satya (the Truth) and its eulogy. Meditations on the different parts of its body are also described. The akṣipuruṣa (the ocular being) or the jīva and the ādityapuruṣa or the solar being are aspects of Satya-brahman. At the time of death, the solar being withdraws his rays and hence the dying man sees the sun as an orb without its rays.</p>
			<p>The sixth called <em>Mano-brāhmaṇa</em>, enjoins a meditations on vidyut (lightning) and vāk (speech or the Vedas) as Brahman. The ninth recommends meditation on agni or fire as Vaiśvānara or Virāj. The tenth section known as the <em>Gati-brāhmaṇa</em> des-cribes the goals of the above meditations, which is, residence in Brahmaloka throughout the life-time of Hiraṇyagarbha. <em>Tapo-brāhmaṇa</em>, the eleventh, advises us to look upon illness or being carried for the funeral after death, as a tapas or penance, since it can destroy our sins. The twelfth section enjoins that anna (food) and prāṇa (vital force) should be meditated upon as Brahman. The thirteenth brāhmaṇa recommends meditations on the prāṇa as uktha (a recitation connected with Soma-yāga), yajus, sāman and kṣattra (the healer).</p>
			<p>The <em>Gāyatrī-brāhmaṇa</em>, the fourteenth, describes a meditation on Brahman as possessing the Gāyatrī as the upādhi or limiting adjunct. The four pādas or quarters of the Gāyatrī are to be identified respectively with the three worlds, the three Vedas, the three prāṇas or vital-airs and āditya or the sun. This will result in various divine fruits.</p>
			<p>The last section contains a prayer to Āditya or the Sun and Agni or the fire by a dying man, who has combined meditation with rites (jñāna-karma-samuccaya), for the removal of the obstacles to his journey on the uttarāyaṇa or the northern path, after death.</p>
			<h3>Sixth Chapter</h3>
			<p>There are six brāhmaṇas in this chapter. <em>Prāṇasaṁvāda-brāhmaṇa</em>, the first one, demonstrates through an allegory that the prāṇa or the vital force, is the eldest and the best of all organs. Once, a dispute arose among the sense-organs like the eye and the speech, as to which of them was the greatest. Prajāpati when approached by them for the adjudication, ruled that the greatest among them was that organ by whose departure the body would be rendered more impure. The departure of vāk (speech), cakṣus (the eyes), śrotra (the ears), retas (organ of generation) and manas (the mind), one by one, did not make the body more impure. It continued to live. But, when prāṇa (also called mukhyaprāṇa) tried to depart, all the other organs also were pulled out of their places of residence. Hence it was decided that the prāṇa or the vital force was the best.</p>
			<p>The second is the <em>Karmavipāka-brāhmaṇa</em> which teaches the <em>Pañcāgni-vidyā</em> or the Doctrine of the Five Fires. Śvetaketu, the proud son of the sage Gautama Āruṇi, goes to the court of the king Pravāhaṇa Jaivali to exhibit his learning. However, when the king puts him five questions, he is unable to answer any of them. Crest-fallen, he returns to his father and objects to his not having taught this subject. Since Gautama too did not know this science, he chooses to go to the king to learn it from him. The king teaches him <em>Pañcāgnividyā</em> or the Doctrine of the Five Fires. The five fires are: dyuloka (heaven), parjanya (rain), this loka or world, puruṣa (man) and yoṣā (woman). Householders who know this meditation on the Five Fires as also the hermits who meditate with faith on the Hiraṇyagarbha go to Brahmaloka by the Uttarāyaṇa, the northern path (also called Devayāna and Arcirādimārga) and will not return to this world again. But those who practise sacrifices and penances, and give gifts, will travel along the path of smoke (called Dhūmādimārga or the Dakṣiṇāyana or Pitṛyāna) to the Pitṛloka, the world of manes. After exhausting the results of their good deeds there, they return to this world. They rotate like a Persian Wheel in the circle of transmigration, till they attain the Devayāna or immediate liberation. The rest, the ignorant ones, are born as moths, insects and so on.</p>
			<p>The third section called <em>Śrīmantha-brāhmaṇa</em> describes the rite of Śrīmantha (the paste for prosperity) as a means to attaining greatness and thereby, wealth, which is needed to perform the Vedic rituals. There is also the eulogy of this rite and the line of teachers.</p>
			<p>The fourth section describes the Putramantha rite, by which a house-holder can get a worthy son or a worthy daughter. Only the performer of the Śrīmantha rite is eligible to conduct this rite.</p>
			<p>The fifth, the last, section called <em>Vaṁśa-brāhmaṇa</em> describes the long line of teachers from Hiraṇyagarbha up to Pautimāṣīputra.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>The <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> occupies a pre-eminent place among the Upaniṣads not only for its size but also for its teachings. Almost all aspects of the teachings of Vedānta—Brahman/Ātman, creation, nature of the individual soul and its destiny, theory of karma, analysis of the three states of consciousness, various modes of Upaniṣadic meditations, characteristics of a liberated being—find a place in it.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad also throws some inte-resting light on the contemporary society. Not only were there, great sages and men of learning, devoted to their respective fields of knowledge, they would also meet occasionally, either for disputation or for exchange of ideas. Noble kings like Janaka, Pravāhaṇa Jaivali and Ajātaśatru, who were themselves eminent men of learning, provided opportunities for such sages to gather in their courts and also rewarded them generously. Women, earnestly interested in Vedic learning, austerity or even self-knowledge had easy access to it, as shown by the instances of Maitreyī (a housewife) and Gārgī (a brahmavādinī, student of Vedic learning). The fact that Gārgī was also one among the sages that had assembled in the court of the king Janaka, and had dared to question Yājñavalkya, speaks volumes about the high status of women during the Vedic period. The myth that the ancient Hindus always craved for sons and looked down upon daughters has been exploded in the mantra 6.4.17 wherein the desire of the parents for a learned daughter (paṇḍitā duhitā) has been clearly stated.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad also places frankly before us, examples of men of conceit, born out of their scholarship or high birth (eg., Dṛpta Bālāki and Śvetaketu) on the one hand and persons of great humility and culture who were never averse to learning from the others even though they may be inferior in the social hierarchy of those days (eg., Gautama) on the other.</p>
			<p>References to the powerful horses of Sindhu country, to the chariots, kings and their big retinue, cows and gold coins as also to the various kinds of spiritual sciences and rituals bespeak of a high degree of civilization and culture.</p>
			<p>One can safely say that the <em>Bṛhadā-raṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> represents a landmark in the development of early philosophical literature of India.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;[a] big work dealing with the] Vedic deities&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The sage Śaunaka (500 B.C.) has done yeomen service to the preservation of the Vedic literature by composing ten works, generally classed as &#x2018;anukramaṇīs&#x2019; (See <ref>ANUKRAMAṆĪ</ref> for details.) in which is included this celebrated work, <em>Bṛhad-devatā</em>. It is an index of the Vedic gods, more extensive than other similar works.</p>
			<p>This treatise on the Vedic deities is in the form of verses in the anuṣṭubh meter spread over eight adhyāyas or chapters, corresponding to the eight aṣṭakas (the more ancient method of dividing the <em>Ṛgveda</em>) of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. The first two chapters contain 125 verses of an introduc-tory nature which discuss several aspects of Vedic grammar useful in the analysis or interpretation of the Vedic words. Then the book takes up the difficult task of determining and describing the devatās or deities of the various sūktas of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, often narrating interesting anecdotes also, related to those deities.</p>
			<p>Some of the more ancient sages mentioned in this work are: Śākaṭāyana, Yāska, Śākapūṇi and Gālava.</p>
			<p>Since an &#x2018;Ācārya Śaunaka&#x2019; has been mentioned in this <em>Bṛhad-devatā</em> itself, some Western scholars opine that this work must have been composed by another person, probably his contemporary. But other scholars do not subscribe to this view.</p>

			<p>The purāṇas (Hindu mythological lore) served two purposes. As the primary means of mass education they spread not only knowledge—both secular and sacred—but also wisdom and culture. In addition they also helped the society to preserve its history and hoary traditions.</p>
			<p>The purāṇas are generally classified into two groups: the mahāpurāṇas and the upapurāṇas. Each group comprises 18 works.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bṛhad-dharma-purāṇa</em> is an upapurāṇa, probably compiled in the 13th century. It is more like a smṛti or a dharmaśāstra than a purāṇa. Rites and practices of the various varṇas and āśramas, gifts, duties of women and others—these are some of the topics dealt with. The birth and sports of Kṛṣṇa are also portrayed.</p>

			<word>Bṛhadīśvara Temple</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;Temple of the Great Lord&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Belief in God is a basic human trait. Though this God may be the infinite cosmic spirit, the human being, encased as he is, in a limited frame and a limited mind, can think of him only in a place of worship or in a temple.</p>
			<p>Hindu temples are a very ancient institution. Their development has been spread over several centuries. Though the earliest permanent structures built out of stone and bricks that have withstood the vagaries of time have been assigned to the 4th century A.D., icons of gods and goddesses have been discovered even in the Harappa-Mohenjodaro excavations (2500 B.C.) suggesting the possibility of existence of places of worship.</p>
			<p>In the history of the development of the Hindu temples, the Coḷā period (A.D. 900-1200) is one of the golden periods. The Bṛhadīśvara temple of Tañjāvūr (also spelt as Tanjore) in Tamil Nadu is a remarkable structure, perhaps the biggest and the best, belonging to this period. It was built by Rājarāja the First (reign A.D. 985-1013).</p>
			<p>The story goes that Rājarāja was a victim of black leprosy due to the sins committed in an earlier life as a hunter. To expiate the sins and to get rid of the disease, he was commanded by his guru Haradatta to build a temple for Śiva after getting a liṅga (emblem of Śiva) from the river Narmadā. When the king went to the river and got the liṅga out of water, it started growing bigger and bigger. Hence the name Bṛhadīśvara (bṛhat = big or large). The temple took twelve years to build and was consecrated during A.D. 1011. The official name given to the liṅga or the deity is Rājarājeśvara.</p>
			<p>The temple complex is situated in the southern half of a small fort and is surrounded by a moat on the east and the west. Apart from the main temple, the complex contains temples of Devī called Bṛhannāyakī, Subrahmaṇya, Gaṇeśa, Navagrahas and a number of liṅgas estimated around 252.</p>
			<p>The length and width of the actual temple structure is 45.5 metres (150 ft.) and 27 metres (90 ft.).</p>
			<p>The most striking feature of this temple is its vimāna or towered sanctuary which rises perpendicularly from a 15 metre (50 ft.) high square base and then tapers off to a total height of 65 metres (216 ft.). There are fourteen storeys, with small pillars, pretty balcony windows and beautiful images carved thereon. The kalaśa or finial is 3.8 metres (12.5 ft.) high and weighs 80 tonnes.</p>
			<p>The liṅga itself is quite massive, both in diameter and in height.</p>
			<p>Nandi, the mount of Śiva, placed in front is also of generous proportions, measuring nearly 6 metres (20 ft.) in length and 3.6 metres (12 ft.) in height. It is said to be the second biggest in India, the one at Lepākṣi (in Andhra Pradesh) being the biggest.</p>
			<p>The corridor of circumambulation just outside the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em> has fresco paintings depicting stories and incidents from Hindu mythology.</p>
			<p>Another temple in the campus, dedicated to Subrahmaṇya or Kārttikeya (son of Śiva) deserves our attention due to its being an exquisite piece of architecture. The stone carvings of elaborate patterns are perfect. Its vimāna (tower over the shrine) rises to a height of 16.5 metres (55 ft.). It was probably built around A.D. 1600 by the Naik dynasty.</p>
			<p>The religious rituals of the temple are according to the <em>Mukuṭāgama</em> and the brahmotsava, the chief festival, is conducted for 18 days during April-May.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The <em>Bṛhad-yogi-yājñavalkya</em> is a large work in Sanskrit comprising 930 verses spread over 12 chapters. The subject matter is a combination of some topics of dharmaśāstras and of others dealt with in works on yoga and mantras.</p>
			<p>The work begins with the questions posed by some sages to Yogīśvara of Mithilā.</p>
			<p>The following is a brief summary of the twelve chapters:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Essence of the Vedas, the smṛtis and the fourteen vidyas; ātma-jñāna; mantrajapa.</li>
				<li>Praṇava or Oṅkāra.</li>
				<li>The Vyāhṛtis (bhūḥ etc.).</li>
				<li>The Gāyatrī.</li>
				<li>Some nyāsas (purification of limbs).</li>
				<li>Sandhyā ritual.</li>
				<li>Snāna (bath), tarpaṇa (offering of water to the manes) and japa (muttering of mantras). </li>
				<li>Prāṇāyāma (breath control) and pratyāhāra (withdrawal of mind from sense-objects).</li>
				<li>Dhyāna or meditation.</li>
				<li>Sūryopasthāna (worship of the Sun with the mantras and Gāyatrī).</li>
				<li>Yogadharma or the practice of yoga.</li>
				<li>Origination of the śāstras from the Vedas and allied topics.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The work quotes a large number of verses from the <em>Manusmṛti</em> and contains many verses of the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> also. Several passages from the Upaniṣads too are found in it.</p>
			<p>One interesting statement that this book makes is that Gārgī was the wife of Yājñavalkya. This however is not correct as we find from the more authoritative scripture, viz., the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em>.</p>

			<word>Bṛhajjābālopaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Upaniṣads are the foundation of the Vedānta philosophy. Apart from the ten Upaniṣads, considered as very ancient and canonical, there are a large number of other works, also designated as Upaniṣads. Most of these belong to a much later period and are obviously the creations of the master-minds of the various sects to further their own views. The <em>Bṛhajjābālopaniṣad</em> is one such, of the Śaivite group. Assigned to the <em>Atharvaṇa-veda</em>, it comprises 8 brāhmaṇas or chapters. The total number of mantras—in verses, interspersed with long passages in prose also—is 178.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad is concerned mainly with bhasma or the holy ash, dear to Śiva.</p>
			<p>The sage Bhusuṇḍa was a great yogi but with a corvine body. Once Prajāpati entered into him in a subtle form and made him approach Kālāgni Rudra (one of the several aspects of God Śiva) with the question, &#x2018;O Lord! Kindly tell me about the greatness of vibhūti or the holy ash and rudrākṣa (the berry of the tree <em>Elaeocarpus ganitrus</em>).&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The reply of the Lord as given in the first brāhmaṇa may be briefly stated as follows: Śiva has five faces: Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa and Īśāna. From these emanated five divine cows named Nandā, Bhadrā, Surabhi, Suśīlā and Citravarṇā, all of different colours. The holy ashes prepared out of the dungs of these cows are known as—vibhūti, bhasita, bhasma, kṣāra and rakṣā.</p>
			<p>The second brāhmaṇa starts with the question of Bhusuṇḍi about the rules concerning bhasmasnāna or a bath with the holy ash. The Lord replies by stating that this world itself is bhasma and it assumes several forms by being their antarātman or the inner Self. Here bhasma is identified with the Lord himself since he alone is left when the super-imposed world is negated, even as bhasma or ash is left when everything is consumed in the fire.</p>
			<p>The world is called &#x2018;agnīṣomātmaka&#x2019; since agni (the fire element) and soma (the moon element responsible for rasa or essence or juices) are its components in the cosmic sense. Agni and soma are also identified with the Śiva and Śakti. Hence the whole world is a product of the combination of Śiva and Śakti. One who realises that Śiva and Śakti are identical and also his own oneness with them, attains amṛtatva or immortality.</p>
			<p>The third brāhmaṇa describes the process of preparing the vibhūti or the holy ash. The dung of which types of cows is to be selected and which to be avoided is stated first. After preparing small balls of the dung and drying them in the sun, they have to be offered into the fire with the appropriate mantras. The bhasma or ash collected should then be scented with certain dry powders, uttering the mantras as stated in the work.</p>
			<p>The bhasma should then be applied all over the body, from head to feet, chanting the <em>Pañcabrahma-mantras</em> (<em>Mahānārāyaṇopaniṣad</em> 17 to 21) while doing so.</p>
			<p>The fourth brāhmaṇa states the times of the day—like dawn, dusk and night—when bhasma can be applied. This bhasma should be applied as three lines on the forehead, with the three middle fingers after mixing it with the water from a conch. While applying it, one should think of the three aspects of God, Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. The bhasma can be applied on other parts of the body also, like the chest, throat and nose.</p>
			<p>The fifth brāhmaṇa gives some more details concerning the wearing of bhasma on the forehead and other parts of the body. The three lines have to be mentally identified with the three Vedas—the <em>Sāmaveda</em>, the <em>Yajurveda</em> and the <em>Ṛgveda</em>—in that order from the top to the bottom. The members of the three varṇas (brāhmaṇas, kṣattriyas and vaiśyas) should use the bhasma of the gārhapatya fire used for the Agnihotra sacrifice. The avadhūtas—the saints who have transcended the varṇa and āśrama system—should wear the ashes gathered from the cremation ground. The ashes obtained from a Śiva temple are sacred for all, without any distinction.</p>
			<p>This is then followed by an eulogy of wearing the tripuṇḍra—the three lines drawn with the bhasma—by narrating the fruits that will accrue to the wearer. Then comes a castigation in strong terms, of those who have abandoned wearing the bhasma or who deride and harass the votaries that wear it.</p>
			<p>The greatness and the miraculous powers of bhasma are recounted by the next, the sixth, brāhmaṇa. It can revive even dead persons if sprinkled upon the bodies with the <em>Mṛtyuñjaya-mantra</em>. It can destroy the sins of even the vilest ones and can grant knowledge even to Hari or Viṣṇu! The section ends with further eulogies of the knowledge taught here, called Bṛhajjābālavidyā.</p>
			<p>The seventh brāhmaṇa is almost a revision of the earlier section. It also describes the birth of the rudrākṣa beads (the berries of the tree <em>Elaeocarpus ganitrus</em>) and the mode of wearing them. These beads were born out of the eyes (akṣa or akṣi) of Rudra, and hence the name rudrākṣa. One who wears them on his body attains infinite merit.</p>
			<p>The last chapter—the eighth brāh-maṇa—states the results of reciting this Upaniṣad such as attaining purity, the capacity to assert the power of the elemental forces like fire and wind, conquest of death and all the worlds, as also getting the knowledge of all sciences. After death, the reciter attains the Supreme.</p>

			<p>Hindu astronomy and its allied branch, astrology, are as old as the Vedas. Called &#x2018;Vedāṅga-jyautiṣa&#x2019; or simply &#x2018;Jyautiṣa&#x2019; it deals with the appropriate periods and timings for conducting the Vedic sacrifices.</p>
			<p>Astrology deals more specifically with the influence of the stars and planets on human life, both at the individual and at the collective level.</p>
			<p>Of the several ancient works (in Sanskrit) on astrology, the <em>Bṛhajjātaka</em> of Varāhamihira (A.D. 600) is generally consi-dered as the best and the most authoritative. It has 28 adhyāyas or chapters and 409 ślokas or verses in different metres. As the very name suggests, it deals mainly with jātakas or horoscopes of human beings. Of the four commentaries available now, that of Bhaṭṭa Utpala is considered the best.</p>
			<p>The topics dealt with in the work are: the twelve rāśis or the zodiacal signs, the nine planets, effects of the planets at the time of conception on the person to be born, indications of early death, longe-vity of a child, lunar combinations, avocations as indicated by the planets, miscellaneous planetary combinations, on evils, on female horoscopes, on death and on lost horoscopes.</p>
			<p>In the last chapter the author apo-logises for any mistakes that may have crept in and also gives some information about himself. He was the son of a brāhmaṇa, Ādityadāsa by name, hailing from the village Kapittha. He got his education and knowledge from Savitṛ (the Sun-god). He lived in the court of Ujjayinī in the province of Avantī.</p>

			<p>Arjuna had once been cursed to become a eunuch, by the nymph Ūrvaśī since he had spurned, though respectfully, her amorous advances.

		<description>
			<p>Purāṇas or the mythological works of Hinduism serve several purposes. They amplify and expound the truths contained in the Vedas. They give us a glimpse of the contemporary history and culture. They also prescribe a code of conduct to be followed by all, for the welfare of the society. More often they give detailed accounts of several sciences like town-planning, architecture, sculpture, medical sciences or religious rites motivated by the desire for worldly well-being, since that was their way of educating the public.</p>
			<p>These purāṇas are usually classified into two groups: the Mahāpurāṇas and the Upapurāṇas. Each group is said to contain 18 works and all are ascribed by tradition to the sage Vedavyāsa.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bṛhan-nāradīya-purāṇa</em> is classed among the minor purāṇas and is assigned to the period A.D. 900. It is a sectarian work of the Vaiṣnava schools. One of the printed versions comprises 3600 verses in 38 chapters.</p>
			<p>Sometimes this purāṇa has been considered as the first part of the <em>Nāradīya-purāṇa</em> itself.</p>
			<p>Praise of Viṣṇu and of bhakti, geo-graphy of India, story of Sagara, Gaṅgā-māhātmya, a few vratas (religious vows and rites), varṇāśrama-dharmas and śrāddha (obsequial ceremonies)—these are the general contents of this purāṇa.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;Lord of prayer&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Bṛhaspati is a name that is often mentioned in the Hindu scriptures, right from the <em>Ṛgveda</em> up to the purāṇas and the dharmaśāstras. Obviously there are several Bṛhaspatis, divine and human. </p>
			<p>In the <em>Ṛgveda</em> he is described as the Lord of prayers and is identified with Brahmaṇaspati (2.23.1). He is considered as a devatā or a god. Gaṇapati, the later paurāṇic deity, seems to have had his origin in this Bṛhaspati-Brahmaṇaspati.</p>
			<p>During the period of the epics and the purāṇas he is described as a sage, the son of Aṅgīrasa. Being a person of great learningand wisdom and an expert in the performance of rituals, the gods in heaven under the leadership of Devendra, chose him as their guru or preceptor. Śukrācārya, the preceptor of the asuras or demons was his rival.</p>
			<p>Tārā was his wife and the mother of Budha from Candra, the moon. Budha is one of the planets.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>He has many exploits attributed to him such as saving the worlds by assuming the form of Agni or fire, saving the honour of Śacīdevī, the consort of Devendra from being forced by the king Nahuṣa, surreptitiously acquiring the knowledge of the rejuvenation of the dead through his son Kaca, misleading the asuras when Śukrā-cārya was away and so on.</p>
			<p>Bṛhaspati is the presiding deity of the planet called Guru or Jupiter and effects beneficial results. In the works on iconography he is described as a minor deity of splendid appearance, with rosary or with four arms, carrying a daṇḍa (staff) and a kamaṇḍalu (water-pot) in addition. He is seated on a chariot drawn by eight horses.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, Bṛhaspati is mentioned as the originator of atheism. This may have been based on the myth that he once disguised himself as Śukrācārya and taught atheism and materialism to the asuras to mislead them!</p>
			<p>There is one more Bṛhaspati, the writer of a dharmaśāstra, or arthaśāstra. Kauṭilya (300 B.C.) has quoted several verses from his work. The <em>Mahābhārata</em> alludes to Bṛhaspati who is said to have compressed into 3000 chapters the work on dharma, artha and kāma composed originally by Brahmā. The <em>Vanaparva</em> of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> speaks of a work called <em>Bṛhaspatinīti</em>.</p>
			<p>This Bṛhaspati is said to have advised the kings, the acquisition of only two vidyās—vartā (agriculture, trade and commerce) and daṇḍanīti (statecraft including the laws governing crime and punishment as also the science of war).</p>

			<p>The Bṛhatī is a well-known chandas or meter of Vedic Saṁhitās. Out of 14 such Vedic meters, it occupies the 4th place. It has 4 pādas or quarters, with 9 letters in each pāda. According to the sage Śaunaka, as mentioned in his <em>Chando&#x2019;nu-kramaṇī</em>, there are 181 mantras in the <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> composed in the Bṛhati metre.</p>
			<p><em>Bṛhatī</em> is also the name of a well-known commentary by Prabhākara (8th century) on the <em>Śābara-bhāṣya</em>, which itself is a commentary by Śabara (57 B.C.) on the famous <em>Mīmāṁsāsūtras</em> of Jaimini (200 B. C.).</p>

			<p>Jyautiṣa or astronomy is Vedāṅga, a subsidiary science that helps in determining suitable times for the performance of Vedic sacrifices.</p>
			<p>Over the centuries, Jyautiṣa evolved into a much larger and much more complicated science, embodying in itself, not onlyastronomy, but also astrology, the science that predicts the influence of the planets and other heavenly bodies on human affairs.</p>
			<p>One of the basic works on Hindu Astrology is the <em>Bṛhatsaṁhitā</em> of Varāha-mihira (6th century A.D.). Though it deals mainly with astrology, it is quite encyclopaedic in its scope and includes several other branches of knowledge as geography, architecture, iconography, gem-therapy and so on. Each of these subjects has been treated, keeping in view its significance as an augury or its astrological effects. For instance, the section on rubies describes how one can know the quality of a gem, but it also gives the effects of wearing a good ruby. </p>
			<p>Another interesting feature of this work is its 104th chapter. The various stanzas that deal with the astrological effects of the planets are composed in different meters, the name of the meter itself being ingeniously included in the verse itself.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Buddha (also known as Gautama Buddha and Śākya Muni) is one of the very few religious leaders of the world who have revolutionised the life of a very large mass of people for generations, influencing their religion, philosophy and culture including many aspects of arts and sciences.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Born on a Vaiśākha pūrṇimā day, as the only son of Śuddhodana (the king of Kapilavāstu) and Māyādevī (at Lumbiṇī, now in Nepal), he was named Siddhārtha. He lived an easy and protected life as the beloved prince and heir to the throne up to the age of 29 years. He was married to the princess Yaśodharā and had a son (Rāhula) by her. One day (for the first time in his life), he went out to see the city. The sight of an old man, a sick man, a corpse and a monk made a deep impression on his mind. He then realized that life was full of suffering and decided to become a monk to discover the path to blessedness, totally free of all suffering. He renounced the world on a Vaiśākha pūrṇimā day, retired to a forest and practised very severe austerities but to no avail. He then sat under a tree on the bank of the river Nairāñjanā in Gayā vowing that he would not get up from his seat until he realized the truth. Soon, he was enlightened and it was again on a Vaiśākha pūrṇimā day. The tree came to be known as &#x2018;Bodhivṛkṣa&#x2019; and he became the Buddha, the enlightened one. He then went to Vārāṇasī (Kāśī) and gave his first sermon there. This sermon came to be known as <em>dharmacakrapravartana</em> or the discourse of setting in motion, the wheel of dharma. He was 35 at that time. He lived up to 80. For a long period of 45 years he roamed about the country teaching his doctrines of spiritual wisdom to one and all. He established a Saṅgha or a religious order of his monastic disciples to propagate his teachings. He passed away, again, on a Vaiśākha pūrṇimā day. Hence this day is called the thrice-blessed day.</p>
			<p>As regards the period of Buddha&#x2019;s life the dates vary from 624 B.C.-544 B.C. up to 557 B.C.-477 B.C. It may be safely assumed that he lived during the sixth century B.C.</p>
			<p>Buddha&#x2019;s teachings may be summarized as follows:</p>
			<p>Buddha teaches &#x2018;catvāri āryasatyāni,&#x2019; the four noble truths. They are:</p>
			<ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>duḥkha or the existence of suffering in this world;</li>
				<li>duḥkha-samudāya or that there is a cause for this suffering;</li>
				<li>duḥkhanirodha or that it is possible to stop this suffering;</li>
				<li>duḥkha-nirodha-mārga or that there is a way out of this suffering.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>He calls the last as the ārya-aṣṭāṅgika-mārga, or the eightfold noble path. These eight steps are: samyag-dṛṣṭi (right views), samyak-saṅkalpa (right resolve), samyag-vāk (right speech), samyak-karmānta (right conduct), samyag-ājīva (right livelihood), samyag-vyāyāma (right effort), samyak-smṛti (right mindfulness) and samyak-samādhi (right concentration).</p>
			<p>Buddha calls the state of enlightenment as nirvāṇa which, literally, means extinction (of all sorrow and suffering).</p>
			<p>Compilation, preservation and elaboration of Buddha&#x2019;s teachings (leading to several schools of Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy) took place over centuries through several Buddhist Councils. The <em>Vinaya Piṭaka</em> and the <em>Sutta Piṭaka</em> containing the rules for guiding the monks and the direct teachings of Buddha were compiled during the first Buddhist Council held immediately after Buddha&#x2019;s demise. The <em>Abhidhamma Piṭaka</em> was compiled during the third Council conducted by the emperor Aśoka (3rd century B.C.). The work is abstruse and philosophical and contains the teachings of Buddha&#x2019;s disciples and scholars of the tradition.</p>
			<p>The three works together are known as the <em>Tripiṭaka</em> or the <em>Tipiṭaka</em> and are the canonical works of Buddhism.</p>

		<description>
			<p>&#x2018;Buddhism&#x2019; is the general name given by post-Buddha historians to the religious principles and practices, doctrines and dogmas, of the followers of Gautama Buddha. Though what Buddha taught might be regarded as a cleansing or reformation of the Hinduism of his times, his teachings, over the centuries, have attained a distinctive character of their own, thus deserving the appellation &#x2018;Buddhism&#x2019; or &#x2018;Buddha-mata&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bauddha-dharma&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The four noble truths (catvāri āryasatyāni) and the eightfold noble path (ārya-aṣṭāṅgika-mārga) form the core of Buddhism. Ahiṁsā or non-injury or non-violence is a cardinal ethical principle. Monastic life, as means to nirvāṇa (libe-ration) and Buddha-hood is emphasized greatly.</p>
			<p>During the second Buddhist Council held at Vaiśāli (the present Basarh of Bihar) about a 100 years after the demise of Buddha, there was a split in the ranks of the Buddhists. The conservatives came to be known as the Sthaviravādis or Theravādis. The rest came to be called the Mahāsāṅghikas. These two groups gradually evolved the Hīnayāna and the Mahāyāna schools. The former stressed individual nirvāṇa as the goal of life. The latter stressed compassion, in addition, so that all can be helped in their attempts at obtaining nirvāṇa. Whereas Mahāyāna flourished in China, Japan and Tibet, Hīnayāna spread in Śrī Laṅkā, Myanmar (Burma) and some South East Asian countries.</p>
			<p>Buddhism also developed in course of time, four schools of philosophy: the Mādhyamika or Śūnyavāda, the Yogācāra or Vijñānavāda, the Sautrāntika and the Vaibhāṣika.</p>
			<p>Philosophical works on these schools were written both in Pāḷī and Sanskrit languages.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This is a unique word used only in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> and that too, only three times (2.49; 10.10 and 18.57).</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Buddhi&#x2019; means the intellect and &#x2018;yoga&#x2019; means perfect concentration as well as union. So, the path of spiritual discipline wherein the buddhi plays an important role and ultimately leads to the union of the jīva (the individual soul) with Paramātman (God) is buddhiyoga.</p>
			<p>Karma or action normally binds a person due to the selfish desires behind it. If karma is performed with the full understanding that its motivation by selfish desires leads to saṁsāra or the bondage of transmigration, and that, if motivated by the spirit of unselfish service and devotion to God, the same will lead to liberation, it becomes buddhiyoga since this leads to the ultimate union with God.</p>
			<p>The commentators of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> have interpreted it variously, depending upon the context. However, all the interpretations boil down to the same meaning as given above.</p>
			<p>These are some of them: karma per-formed with equanimity; niṣkāma-karma-yoga that leads to ātmajñāna or self-know-ledge; yoga endowed with the vision of the ātman; uniting the mind with God and so on.</p>

			<p>For thousands of years, people all over the world have believed in the influence of the planets on human life and history. Logically speaking, the creation of the grahas or planets precedes that of the living beings. Hence, some sort of cause and effect relation must subsist between these two. This seems to be the basis for this belief.</p>
			<p>The Navagrahas or the nine planets are regarded by the Hindus as of the greatest astrological significance and are believed to influence the life of the individual as also the course of history.</p>
			<p>As per the traditional list, the nine planets are: Ravi or Sūrya (Sun), Soma or Candra (moon), Maṅgala or Kuja or Aṅgāraka (Mars), Budha (Mercury), Bṛhaspati or Guru (Jupiter), Śukra (Venus), Śani (Saturn), Rāhu and Ketu.</p>
			<p>The seven days of the week have derived their names from the first seven planets. Rāhu and Ketu are not planets but ascending and descending nodes of the moon.</p>
			<p>Budha or Mercury is the fourth in this group of nine planets. According to Hindu mythology, he is the son of Candra and Tārā. He had once been transformed into a woman when he entered the forbidden forest area, the Kumāra-vana. Hence he is also considered as a strīgraha, a feminine planet. He is saumya (pacific in nature) and śubha (auspicious). In images he is shown either as dark or yellow in complexion, wearing a garland of yellow flowers, with four arms, carrying in his hands sword, shield and mace, the last one being in the varadamudrā (gesture of bestowal of boons). His consort is Iḷā.</p>

			<p>Birth and death have ever proved to be a mystery to the human mind. If birth, generally, has brought joy and satisfaction to a family, death, on the other hand, especially of a near and dear one, has invariably caused grief and consternation.</p>
			<p>Again, disposal of the dead body was often looked upon as a religious duty and custom. There seem to have been many ways of disposing off the corpses: leaving them in a forest or an open field or on the top of trees, immersing in rivers or the sea, burial and cremation.</p>
			<p>Existence of the burial system might have been due to the belief that the dead person&#x2019;s soul still resided in the body and might be resurrected to a better birth in course of time.</p>
			<p>Even by the time of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, cremation seems to have gained precedence over all the other methods though burial was not unknown (vide <em>Ṛgveda Saṁhitā</em> 10.18.10-13). However, burial was the rule as far as dead infants and yatis or saṁnyāsins (monks) were concerned.</p>
			<p>The body of the dead yati had to be bathed, adorned with new cloth and buried in a pit as deep as the daṇḍa (staff) which he used to carry. Special Vedic mantras like the <em>Puruṣasūkta</em> had to be chanted during the burial process. The śikya (loop of strings), the pavitra (cloth used for filtering water) and the kamaṇḍalu (water-pot) had to be placed on the various parts of the body as recommended by the dharmaśāstra works and the pit filled with salt, sand and earth. A mound may be raised later on the spot.</p>
			<p>Burial seems to have been resorted to in the case of the yatis or saṁnyāsins since they had ceremonially given up the Vedic fires at the time of taking saṁnyāsa.</p>
			<p>In the modern times, except certain classes of the lower castes, all the others prefer cremation to burial.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In the Indian philosophical systems, the word has been used widely to denote consciousness. Some systems like the Vedānta, identify it with the ātman/ Brahman.</p>
			<p>The Cārvākas (materialists) who admit of only four bhūtas or fundamental elements consider consciousness as the property of the body and a product of these elements, like the intoxicating power of a drink being produced by the chemical combination of certain things. The Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika schools consider it as a quality of the soul produced in it by its conjunction with the mind and other conditions of knowledge. The Mīmāṁsakas and Jainas also hold the same view. The Buddhist schools consider it as a series of momentary cognitions, each revealing itself. But Sāṅkhya, Yoga and Advaita Vedānta systems consider it as the very nature of the soul, knowledge being only a manifestation or reflection of consciousness on the vṛttis or modifications of the mind.</p>
			<p>These schools usually recognize three states of consciousness: jāgrat or waking state, svapna or dream state and suṣupti or deep-sleep state. In the waking state knowledge is produced by the contact of the sense-organs with the sense-objects. In the dream state it is produced through saṁskāras or past impressions, eventhough there is no contact between the senses and the objects. In the deep-sleep state, some schools like the Nyāya aver that there is no knowledge whereas the Sāṅkhya, Yoga and Vedānta schools accept the existence of a subtle kind of knowledge, a knowledge about the tamas or nescience which prevails at that time.</p>
			<p>In some of the monastic orders of the Daśanāmī group, this word &#x2018;caitanya&#x2019; is used as an appellation to indicate the state of a brahmacārin, a novice under training for monkhood.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Caitra is the first month of the Hindu lunar calendar, and roughly corresponds to March-April. It got its name from the fact that on the full-moon day of that month, the moon would be in the asterism Citrā. Nirṛti is the supervising deity of this month. Though Citrā is no longer connected with this month now, the name still continues as such.</p>
			<p>The first day of this month is &#x2018;Yugādi&#x2019; (the beginning of the yuga or Age), the New Year&#x2019;s day, celebrated with religious vows and worship. The eighth day of the bright half is Aśokāṣṭamī, a day on which goddess Durgā is worshipped with the flowers of the Aśoka tree. Śrī Rāma-navamī, the birthday of the epic hero Śrī Rāma, is celebrated on the next day. In the dark fortnight, Matsya Jayantī (on the fifth day) and Varāha Jayantī (on the fourteenth day) are the important festivals.</p>

			<p>&#x2018;Citā&#x2019; is the funeral pyre. &#x2018;Caitya&#x2019; is anything that is connected with it. However in practice, a funeral mound, a tree with a rivetment round its stem probably interring the remains of a hero, or even a building serving the same purpose, have all been designated as caityas. The term has also been used as a general nomenclature for any temple.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Over the years the word has acquired a peculiarly Buddhistic flavour. Places—with or without a monument—such as Lumbiṇī, Gayā, Vaiśālī or Rājagṛha associated with Buddha&#x2019;s life, have come to be known as caityas. Stūpas also have been called caityas.</p>
			<p>In the rock-cut cave temples of Buddhistic origin, Caitya Halls are seen. They are apsidal, barrel-vaulted halls used to enshrine a stūpa.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The wheel of a chariot is frequently mentioned in the Ṛgveda as a symbol of the sun. In some of the hymns (vide 1.155.6) the sun is compared to a wheel denoting the principle of time. The Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (20.1) calls the year as a revolving wheel of the gods, on which they move through all the worlds.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>In the Hindu mythological lore, the cakra—translated as &#x2018;discus&#x2019;—is almost exclusively described as a weapon of war, especially of Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa. It is called &#x2018;Sudarśana&#x2019; (&#x2018;that with a pleasing appea-rance&#x2019;) and is shown with six spokes. This confirms the contention of the scholars that it was originally a symbol of the sun and the six spokes represented the six ṛtus or seasons. Sometimes the Sudarśana-cakra is shown personified as a minor deity with a hexagon in his background. Brilliant as fire, he has four or eight or sixteen arms holding bow, arrow, trident, noose, goad and other implements as also weapons apart from the usual Vaiṣṇavite symbols. Symbolically, he represents the cosmic mind, the will of the Lord to multiply as well as his infinite power to create and destroy the universe. The Sudarśana-mantra—a special formula pertaining to it—is said to possess the power to neutralize poisons and exorcise malignant spirits.</p>
			<p>In the mantraśāstras—sciences dealing with mystic formulae—six &#x2018;cakras&#x2019; or arrangements of letters of the alphabet are described which help in determining the suitability of a particular mantra for a particular individual, depending upon his rāśi (zodiacal sign) or nakṣatra (asterism).</p>
			<p>In Buddhism, the cakra symbolizes Dharmacakra, the Wheel of Law, its eight spokes representing the eightfold path prescribed by Buddha for attaining nirvāṇa or emancipation.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Cakradhara, who is credited with the forming of the Mahānubhāva Sect of Maharashtra is said to have lived in the 11th cent. A.D. Some aver that the founder was Govinda Prabhu, a great mystic and Cakradhara was only the first apostle. Cakradhara composed a number of sūtras or aphorisms on this cult. This work is known as Sūtrapāṭha among its followers. The sect itself is of the Bhāgavata Cult and bases its teachings mainly on the Gītā, the Bhāgavata and the Sūtrapāṭha.</p>
			<p>The followers of this sect used to wear dark blue dress, probably in imitation of the colour of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p>
			<p>Though the movement started in Maharashtra, somehow it did not become very popular. Rather it fell into disrepute due to its neglect of the Vedas and disregard for the caste and the āśrama systems. This disrepute made the writers of this sect use esoteric and symbolic language.</p>
			<p>Nāgadeva, Bhāskara, Keśavarāja Sūri and a few others were its distinguished followers. Nāgadeva is said to have organized the cult on a systematic basis. There were women followers too, some of whom were advanced mystics and poetesses of repute.</p>
			<p>In the paurāṇic and hymnal literature the word represents Viṣṇu/Nārāyaṇa/ Kṛṣṇa since he is the wielder of the discus-weapon (Sudarśanacakra).</p>

			<p>This is one of the defects of logic while trying to prove a point. For instance, the arguments for and against the existence of God as the intelligent Creator could run something like this:—</p>

				<dt>Statement:</dt><dd>&#x2018;This world was created by an intelli-gent agent.&#x2019;</dd>
				<dt>Objection:</dt><dd>&#x2018;Since no intelligent creator in this world is seen without a body, then God also must have a body.&#x2019;</dd>
				<dt>Reply:</dt><dd>&#x2018;No. You should consider the general sense of intelligent agentship only.&#x2019;</dd>
				<dt>Objection:</dt><dd>&#x2018;But this is impossible! Give us an example of an effect that is produced by an intelligent agent who does not have a body.&#x2019;</dd>
				<dt>Reply:</dt><dd>&#x2018;For instance, the shoots of corn growing in the field. They have no intelligent human agent behind them.&#x2019;</dd>
				<dt>Objection:</dt><dd>&#x2018;Then, how did they grow?&#x2019;</dd>
				<dt>Reply:</dt><dd>&#x2018;By God&#x2019;s agency.&#x2019;</dd>

			<p>Āyurveda or the science of life has long been accorded a very important status among the various branches of knowledge in Hinduism. It is the first of the four Upavedas or subsidiary Vedas.</p>
			<p>Among the extant works on this science, the two that are considered ancient and highly authoritative are Caraka Saṁhitā and Suśruta Saṁhitā. The renowned commentaries on these two works—Āyurvedadīpikā or Caraka-tātparyadīpikā on the former, and Bhānumatī on the latter—were by one Cakrapāṇidatta. He lived in the 11th cent. A. D. and was the son of Nārāyaṇa, an official at the court of the king Nayapāla of Gauḍadeśa. Naradatta was the teacher under whom he was trained.</p>
			<p>Among his original works, Cikitsā-sārasaṅgraha ranks first.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The cult of the Devī or the Divine Mother, though originating from the Ṛgveda itself (vide 10.125) gradually developed into two main channels: the dakṣiṇamārga or the right-handed path and the vāmamārga or the left-handed path. The latter was perhaps a grotesque metamorphosis brought about by non-Vedic aboriginal and primitive cults. As a result many sex-rites made their way into this left-handed path. The tāntric literature is replete with such rites.</p>
			<p>One such abominable rite is the cakrapūjā or &#x2018;worship in a circle&#x2019;. According to the Kaulāvalīnirṇaya, an equal number of men and women, without distinction of caste or even blood relationship, secretly meet at night and sit in a circle. The goddess is represented by a yantra or diagram. The women cast their bodices in a receptacle and each of the assembled men finds a female companion for that night by picking up a bodice from the same.</p>
			<p>Scholars are of the view that what might have been simple fertility rites of the ancient days, aimed at increasing agricultural production, might have degenerated into such sex-orgies in the name of religion, especially because of the perverted sexual desires of the wealthy and the powerful persons in the society.</p>

			<p>Once Viṣṇu dug a pit with his cakra or discus and sat in it performing severe penance. The whole pit was filled with his perspiration. In admiration of this penance Śiva shook his head and as a result, his jewelled ear-ornament fell into this pit. Hence it came to be known as &#x2018;Cakrapuṣkariṇī&#x2019; or &#x2018;Maṇikarṇikā&#x2019;. It is the same as the Maṇikarṇikā Ghāṭ of the river Gaṅgā in Vārāṇasī or Kāśī.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Śākta Āgamas, more commonly known as the tantras, declare that the human body is a little universe in itself and that the various tattvas or cosmic principles in creation are there embedded in it. However, each of these tattvas has its own centre of activity, the place where it is most preponderant and from where its energies radiate into the system. They have been called &#x2018;cakras&#x2019; (circles or centres) and have often been likened to lotuses. They are not anatomical centres like the nerve-plexuses but subtle seats of consciousness, of Śakti or divine Power.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Works on Yoga depict fourteen principal nāḍīs or subtle conduits for the flow of prāṇic energy, of which the suṣumnā, the iḍā and the piṅgalā are the most important ones. The suṣumnā is situated inside the spinal column and iḍā and piṅgalā entwine it from left and right. All the three start from the root of the spinal column and end near the centre of the head.</p>
			<p>Six cakras are described as being situated in this Suṣumnā. They are mūlā-dhāra, svādhiṣṭhāna, maṇipūra, anāhata, viśuddha and ājñā. The seventh, the sahasrāra, is the final destination of the Kuṇḍalinīśakti, the basic power of the human organism which is likened to a coiled serpent lying dormant at the mūlādhāra, until it is roused by appropriate yogic exercises.</p>
			<p>The mūlādhāracakra is situated in the space between the anus and the generative organ, at the root of the suṣumnānāḍī. It resembles a crimson lotus of four petals. It is the centre of the principle of earth—pṛthvītattva—and controls the sense-organ of smell as also feet, one of the organs of action. Brahmā, along with his Śakti Sāvitrī, is the presiding deity of this cakra.</p>
			<p>The svādhiṣṭhānacakra, next in the series, is situated at the root of the genitals and is placed inside the suṣumnā. It resembles a lotus of vermillion colour with six petals. It is the centre of the principle of water—the aptattva—and controls the sense organ of taste and also the hands from among the organs of action. Viṣṇu along with his Śakti Rākiṇī, is the presiding deity of this centre.</p>
			<p>Then comes maṇipūra, at the navel region. It resembles a lotus of dark hue (like the rain clouds) with ten petals. It is the centre of the principle of fire—tejastattva—and controls the sense-organ of sight and the organ of action, the anus. Rudra with his Śakti Lākinī is the presiding deity.</p>
			<p>The anāhata, situated in the region of the heart, resembles a lotus of twelve petals of blood-red colour. It is the centre of the principle of air—vāyutattva—and controls the sense of touch and the genitals. Īśa with his Śakti Kākinī, is the presiding deity.</p>
			<p>Next comes the viśuddhacakra, in the region of the base of the throat. It resembles a lotus of sixteen petals of smoky purple colour. It is the locus of the principle of ether—ākāśatattva—and controls the organ of hearing as also of speech. Sadāśiva with his Śākinī Śakti is the presiding deity.</p>
			<p>Last of this series of cakras, often designated as &#x2018;ṣaṭcakras&#x2019;, is the ājñācakra situated in the region corresponding to the middle of the eyebrows. It resembles a lotus of two petals of white colour. It is the centre of the principle of mind. Śambhu with his Śakti Hākinī is the presiding deity.</p>
			<p>Beyond this there is the sahasrāra-cakra, resembling a white lotus of a thousand petals, presided over by Parama-śiva himself. It hangs from the brahmarandhra (opening at the top of the skull) and above the suṣumnā, head downwards.</p>
			<p>In fact all these cakras hang head downwards only, until they are pierced by the Kuṇḍalinī, after it is roused from its slumber by appropriate yogic practices. This piercing of the cakras by the Kuṇḍalinī is called &#x2018;ṣaṭcakrabheda&#x2019;. When the Kuṇḍalinī reaches the sahasrāra and gets united with Paramaśiva, the yogi will go into samādhi, the superconscious state, experiencing ineffable bliss.</p>
			<p>The tantras also describe the various results that accrue to a person who contemplates on these cakras in the prescribed manner.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Any holy place, place of pilgrimage, associated with the cakra or discus of Lord Viṣṇu, becomes a &#x2018;Cakratīrtha&#x2019;. The mythological works mention several Cakratīrthas. However, a few of them only, which are more well-known in the modern times, may be mentioned here.</p>
			<p>One of the 24 ponds near Rāmeśvaram (in Tamil Nadu) where the pilgrims have their bath, is called &#x2018;Cakra-tīrtha&#x2019;. The local legend states that the Sudarśana-cakra of Lord Viṣṇu, which was pursuing the sage Durvāsas who had offended Ambarīṣa, a great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, entered into the pond here and disappeared.</p>
			<p>There is one Cakratīrtha near Prabhāsa (the modern Somnath, in Gujarat). Lord Viṣṇu is supposed to have washed his cakra or discus here after killing all the demons in a battle.</p>
			<p>Another Cakratīrtha is situated about six miles from Tryambaka near Nāsik in Maharashtra.</p>
			<p>Chakdhar in Kashmir considered to be a place of great sanctity, associated with Lord Viṣṇu, is also known as &#x2018;Cakradhara&#x2019; or &#x2018;Cakratīrtha&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The river Tuṅgabhadrā near the ruins of Hampi (in Bellary district of Karnataka) flows round the Ṛṣyamūka hill and is called Cakratīrtha there.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The concept of an emperor, a sovereign monarch ruling over vast areas and having vassal kings, is not unknown to the ancient Hindu scriptures. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (ch. 39) mentions the names of several emperors such as Janamejaya, Śatānīka and Bharata. In the later recor-ded history, several kings have tried to attain the status of emperors. Aśoka, Harṣavardhana and Samudra Gupta are instances to the point.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;cakravartin&#x2019; along with the word &#x2018;samrāṭ&#x2019; has commonly been used to denote an emperor. Literally, the word may mean &#x2018;one whose cakra or wheel of the chariot rotates (vartanam = rotation) unimpeded,&#x2019; thereby signifying his absolute conquest over the land. According to the science of Hindu physiognomy, anyone who has the sign of a &#x2018;cakra&#x2019; (wheel, discus or lotus) on his hand is a &#x2018;cakravartin,&#x2019; and is destined to become an emperor.</p>
			<p>Sometimes the word &#x2018;cakra&#x2019; is interpreted as &#x2018;maṇḍala&#x2019; or circle of kings, cakravartin being their overlord.</p>
			<p>A cakravartin is said to possess &#x2018;seven jewels&#x2019; (saptaratna). They are: cakra, chariot, jewel, queen, wealth, horse and elephant. Here &#x2018;cakra&#x2019; may mean the auspicious sign of the Sudarśanacakra of Lord Viṣṇu on his hand.</p>
			<p>In Jainism, the word is used as an epithet for a group of twelve great souls like Bharata and Brahmadatta. They were emperors in the spiritual field.</p>

			<p>&#x2018;Cakṣurvrata,&#x2019; also called &#x2018;netravrata,&#x2019; is performed on the second day of the bright half of the month Caitra (March-April). The performer has to worship the Aśvins (twin deities, said to be the physicians of gods identified with the sun and the moon) and has to subsist only on curds and ghee. It can be done only once or repeated for twelve years. The performer is assured of a good eyesight. If the vow is kept up for twelve years, he will become a king.</p>

			<p>Eye is the most important of all the sense organs. The sun is described by the Vedas as the eye of all that exists.</p>
			<p>According to the Upaniṣads the power to see that exists in the eye, and the power of light capable of revealing objects, that exists in the sun, are both essentially the same; and, Āditya is the deity that presides over both. When a human being dies, his &#x2018;eye&#x2019; (the power to see) gets merged in the Āditya.</p>
			<p>Belief in the evil influence of the eyes of some people (dṛṣṭidoṣa) is common to India as to many other countries. It is said to cause death, illness, injury, poverty and other evil effects. Children and animals are said to be more vulnerable to it. Hence the use of amulets, countercharms and protective gestures has been resorted to over the years. According to the Atharvaveda, an amulet of the &#x2018;jiṅgiḍa&#x2019; plant gives such protection. The same Veda (2.7.5) contains a hymn called &#x2018;Cakṣurmantra&#x2019; directed against curses and those who curse, the invoker requesting for the possessor of the &#x2018;evil eye&#x2019; to be harmed (so that he will not harm others).</p>
			<p>Cakṣu is the name of one of the seven branches of the river Gaṅgā after it descended on earth and got divided. It is generally identified with the river Oxus or Amu Darya in central Asia.</p>

			<p>The desire to acquire and to use supernatural powers is a natural trait of human beings. It has given rise to a whole range of occult sciences.</p>
			<p>One of the powers that is most fascinating and sought after is the clairvoyant power, the power to see at will anything that is taking place anywhere in the world. This is called &#x2018;cākṣuṣī&#x2019; in the ancient Sanskrit works. The Mahābhārata (1.186) refers to it in the episode of Arjuna and a Gandharva hero Citraratha. Arjuna taught him about the fire missile (āgneyāstra) and learnt the cākṣuṣīvidyā from him.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Śivaliṅgas or emblems of Śiva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity, are of two types: acalaliṅgas and calaliṅgas. The former are immovable or fixed, whereas the latter are movable or portable. Stone liṅgas fixed in temples belong to the former category.</p>
			<p>The calaliṅgas are of various types: mṛṇmaya (made of earth or clay), lohaja (prepared out of metal), ratnaja (shaped out of precious stones), dāruja (carved out of wood), śailaja (made of stone) and kṣaṇika-liṅgas (those prepared temporarily for the occasion and disposed off, like the ones made out of riverside clay or cooked rice).</p>
			<p>White clay gathered from pure places such as hilltops or river-beds is recommended for mṛṇmayaliṅgas. The lohaja liṅgas are generally cast from metals like gold, silver or copper. The ratnaja variety is shaped out of precious stones like pearls, coral, topaz or emerald. The timber of trees like śamī (Prosposis spicegera), madhuka (Bassis latifolia), arjuna (Termi-nalia arjuna) pippala (Ficus religiosa) or udumbara (Ficus glomerata) is recommended for dāruliṅgas. The śailaja or stone liṅgas are generally worn on the body by the followers of Śaiva cults like the liṅgāyats. The kṣaṇika liṅgas are shaped out of riverside sand or clay, uncooked or cooked rice, cowdung, butter, sandal paste, flour or jaggery. They are made for the occasion and then disposed off, soon after the worship is over.</p>
			<p>Worship of different kinds of liṅgas confers different results. For instance, that of gold liṅga gives wealth; that of cooked rice, plenty of food; that of cowdung, freedom from diseases.</p>
			<p>Baked clay liṅgas are used for ābhicārika purposes, i.e., for harming others through black magic.</p>

		<description>
			<p>&#x2018;Camarī-mṛga&#x2019; is the animal yak normally found in Tibet. A long chowrie prepared from the hairs on the bushy tail of the yak was commonly used by the attendants of a king as a sort of a fan, to ward off flies and insects. However, in course of time, it became a part of the royal insignia, along with the chatra or umbrella. It is used in the ceremonial worship of a deity also, at the time of ārati or vespers.</p>

			<p>Cāmara, according to the Devī-māhātmya section of the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, was one of the generals of the demon king Mahiṣāsura, who was slain by Durgā.</p>

			<p>Out of the several implements used in a Vedic sacrifice, &#x2018;camasa&#x2019; is an important one. It is a kind of cup, with or without a handle, usually square in shape and made of the nyagrodha wood (Ficus indica). The handle could be round, square or even triangular.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>It is generally used for containing the Soma juice for libation, for drinking the same by priests, and for bringing the &#x2018;praṇītā&#x2019; waters for making dough for the caru in a sacrifice. (See <ref>PRAṆĪTĀ</ref>.)</p>
			<p>Out of the sixteen priests involved in a sacrifice, only ten are entitled to have camasa and they are called &#x2018;camasins&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (2.2.3) compares the human head to a camasa, kept inverted.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Campā, variously known as Campā-purī, Campakāvatī, Campānagara and so on, was the capital of the once well-known Aṅgadeśa. Romapāda, father of Śāntā and father-in-law of the famous sage Ṛṣya-śṛṅga, was the king here in very ancient times. Rāmāyaṇa mentions it. During the times of the Mahābhārata Karṇa was ruling from here.</p>
			<p>It has been identified with Nathnagar near Bhagalpur in Bihar.</p>
			<p>Some scholars opine that the famous Buddhist work, the Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra was composed here probably in the 4th century A.D.</p>
			<p>Campā is said to be the birthplace of Vāsupūjya, the twelfth Tīrthaṅkara and also associated with the last, Mahāvīra.</p>
			<p>Hindu religion, culture and way of life had spread beyond the borders of India even from the ancient days. There are archaeological, epigraphical and other evidences to prove its existence in the South East Asian countries from the 1st century A.D. The kingdom of Campā—the South Annam region of Vietnam—is a country of this group.</p>
			<p>One Śrīmāra established a Hindu dynasty there in A. D. 192. The kingdom itself—though the rulers changed now and then—continued till A. D. 1471 when it was annexed by the kings of Annam.</p>
			<p>Among the several distinguished rulers of Campā, the names of Bhadravarma, Rudravarma, Harivarma, Mahendra-varma, Jayasiṁhavarma and Jaya Indra-varma may be mentioned. They were all Hindu rulers and had adopted Hindu ways of administration. Most of them were well-versed in Sanskrit and Hindu sciences, both religious and secular. Hence they had adopted Sanskrit as the State language.</p>
			<p>In the social fabric, the varṇa-āśrama system had been deeply rooted. The various saṁskāras (religio-social sacraments) like marriage, were being done by the priests according to the Hindu dharma-śāstras.</p>
			<p>Though Śaivism had been patronized by the State, Vaiṣṇavism and Buddhism also flourished. Several Hindu temples including innumerable images of Śiva as also liṅgas, have been discovered. However, these temples are smaller in size and are built mostly in brick. In architectural style they resemble the &#x2018;rathas&#x2019; of Mahābalipuram or the temples of Bādāmi in Karnataka.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Mother worship and Mother cult are not alien to Vedic religion as some suggest. The concept of Aditi (mother of gods and a personification of nature) as also the Ambhṛṇīsūkta and the Rātrisūkta of the Ṛgveda clearly contain the origins of the worship of God as Śakti or the Divine Mother.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>One of the early basic texts of the Śakti cult is the Devīmāhātmya also called Durgāsaptaśatī or Caṇḍī. According to this, Kālī, one of the aspects of Durgā that emanated from her forehead, killed the two demons Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, gene-rals of the demon king Śumbha, and got this name. She is described as a fierce goddess, black in colour, emaciated and wearing the cheetah skin as also severed human heads. Her mouth and tongue were of immense proportions. She could kill troups of demons at one stroke and could swallow several elephants in a gulp.</p>
			<p>Cāmuṇḍā is sometimes included in the list of &#x2018;Saptamātṛkās&#x2019; or &#x2018;Seven Mothers&#x2019;, in the place of Nārasiṁhī.</p>
			<p>She actually symbolizes the power of time in its all-destroying aspect.</p>
			<p>The word is also spelt as Cāmuṇḍī.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>From the Vedic days certain groups of people used to be kept outside the pale of civilized society. &#x2018;Aspṛśyas&#x2019; or &#x2018;untouchables&#x2019; was the general name given to most of them since any kind of contact or proximity with them was considered polluting. This was mostly due to their horrendous ways of living and avocations fraught with potential dangers to the general health of the society.</p>
			<p>The cāṇḍālas—also spelt as &#x2018;caṇḍālas&#x2019;—are an important group of aspṛśyas. Manu defines the cāṇḍāla as one born from a brāhmaṇa woman by a śūdra father (vide Manusmṛti 10.12). Other smṛtis define the word in other ways.</p>
			<p>The cāṇḍālas were expected to live in their own colonies outside the village or town. But they were given to roaming. Their wealth was dogs and donkeys. They lived by cleaning the dirt of the village or town. They ate the carcasses of dead animals and carried corpses of persons who had no relatives, as also looked after the cremation or burial grounds. They acted as executioners of people sentenced to death by the king. They wore ornaments of lead, iron or leather.</p>
			<p>The cāṇḍālas were perhaps the conquered aboriginal tribes, dropouts from the society who never cared to follow its norms, abominable sinners and those following dreadful occupations.</p>

			<p>Candana is sandalwood (Santalum album) well-known for its fragrance and medicinal properties. Indians knew its use even from very ancient days.</p>
			<p>It grows mostly in the Malayagiri (Western Ghats). Three varieties—white, yellow and red—are known to exist. Because of its fragrance and cooling properties it is used as an item of luxury and also for its curative effects. Its paste is one of the most important items offered to a deity in ritualistic worship and is called &#x2018;gandha&#x2019;. In some temples, on certain special days, the image of the deity is decorated entirely with sandal paste.</p>

		<description>
			<p>He is one of the attendant deities of Śiva. According to the mythological lore he was a brāhmaṇa boy, Vicāraśarman by name, who rose to that status by his intense devotion to Śiva.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Iconographically, he is shown as a fierce deity, holding weapons of war and destruction like the bow, arrow, trident, chisel, noose and so on. Though independent shrines dedicated to him are not uncommon, he is generally installed in every Śiva temple in the north eastern corner, facing south. Devotees believe that he can act as a mediator interceding with the Lord on their behalf. Hence supplication before him is a duty of every devotee visiting a Śiva temple.</p>
			<p>He is also known as Caṇḍi and Caṇḍeśa.</p>
			<p>Caṇḍeśvara (14th cent. A.D.) of Mithilā is a very important compiler of digests on dharmaśāstras. He was a minister as well as the chief justice at the court of the king Harisiṁhadeva of Tirhut (now in Bihar). He belonged to the Karṇāta family. Smṛtiratnākara or Ratnā-kara is the extensive digest compiled by him. Divided into seven sections—each containing the word &#x2018;ratnākara&#x2019; as part of the title—it deals with kṛtya (what ought to be done), dāna (gifts), vyavahāra (judicial procedure), śuddhi (purificatory rites), pūjā (ritualistic worship), vivāda (disputes—civil and criminal laws) and gṛhastha (duties of householders). Kṛtyacintā-maṇi and Rājanītiratnākara are his other works considered important.</p>
			<p>Later writers on dharmaśāstras from Mithilā and Vaṅga (Bengal) have been greatly influenced by him.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Throughout the history of India, religious lyrics have proved to be immen-sely popular with the masses. They have often shaped their philosophy of life too.</p>
			<p>During the middle ages, when the cult of Kṛṣṇa-bhakti was gradually gaining ground, the compositions of Caṇḍīdāsa (in the Middle Bengali language) became very popular. &#x2018;Baḍu&#x2019; Caṇḍīdāsa, as he was best known, preceded Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya (A. D. 1486-1534) and is assigned to the 15th cent. A. D. He belonged to Chātna and was a member of the Vaiṣṇava Sahajīya cult. His Śrīkṛṣṇakīrtana is a remarkable poem on the Kṛṣṇa legend in that language. It consists of a chain of lyric songs depicting the principal amorous episodes of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā. Though the tone of the poem is entirely secular often bordering on crude-ness, the style and diction are considered as agreeable.</p>
			<p>There are reasons to believe that there were more Caṇḍīdāsas than one, with epithets such as Dīna, Dvija and Anantabaḍu. But it is difficult to come to any definite conclusions.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;recitation of the Caṇḍī&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Recitation of stotras or hymns has long been accepted as a part of the Hindu religious discipline. Its immense popularity can be gauged from the fact that the Hindu hymnal literature extant today is as vast as the sky and as deep as the ocean.</p>
			<p>Some of these hymns like the Viṣṇu-sahasranāma, the Durgāsaptaśatī (also known as Devīmāhātmya and Caṇḍī) and the Lalitāsahasranāma have acquired an esoteric significance, so much so, that they are considered as &#x2018;mantras&#x2019; or mystic formulae. Consequently, ceremonial recitals of these texts have also been prescribed, often for the fulfilment of specific desires.</p>
			<p>The Caṇḍī or Durgāsaptaśatī is a basic text of the Śākta cult or the cult of the Divine Mother. Its ceremonial recital is called Caṇḍīpāṭha. The recital can be done on any day or days, but the 8th, 9th and the 14th days of the dark lunar fortnight have been specially recommended.</p>
			<p>Since the ceremonial recital is equi-valent to worship, many preliminary disciplines that apply to the latter, apply to the former also. For instance: ācamana (ceremonial sipping of water), prāṇāyāma (regulation of breath), saṅkalpa (religious resolve), dīpasthāpana (establishing a lighted lamp as a witness) and so on. A regular worship has to be offered to the book that is used for the recital. The recital itself should be done audibly and clearly since that is believed to create a wonderful atmosphere, in which the deity presents herself. The main text is preceded by certain hymns like the Kavaca and followed by others like the Rahasyatraya. A regular homa or havan is to be done after the chanting is completed.</p>
			<p>Normally one is expected to chant all the thirteen chapters—which are divided into three books called Caritras—together at one sitting. If this is not possible, alternative modes have also been recommended. Details can be learnt from standard works on the subject or from the adepts in the field.</p>
			<p>Recitation by others—competent brāhmaṇas—may also be arranged, the benefit accruing to the person who arranges it. Recital of the Caṇḍī a hundred times (Śatacaṇḍī) or a thousand times (Sahasracaṇḍī) are done this way and are invariably for the good of the entire community or society or country.</p>
			<p>The recital of the Caṇḍī is said to confer innumerable fruits, from the lowest secular ones to the highest spiritual enlightenment.</p>

			<word>Candra</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;one who delights or shines&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The deity who presides over the moon is called &#x2018;Soma,&#x2019; &#x2018;Indu&#x2019; or &#x2018;Candra&#x2019;. The entire ninth maṇḍala of the Ṛgveda is devoted to his praise. He is the presiding deity of the soma creeper, the juice of which is often used in sacrifices as oblation and also partaken by the participants. Sometimes identified with the Supreme God, he is said to cure the mortals of their diseases and lead them to immortal blissful worlds. He rules over the mind and activates our speech. Hence he is sometimes called &#x2018;Vācaspati&#x2019; or the &#x2018;Lord of speech&#x2019;.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>The Puruṣasūkta of the Ṛgveda declares that Candra was born out of the mind of the Supreme Being.</p>
			<p>In the mythological literature, his birth is described variously as the embodiment of the brilliant light that emerged from the eyes of the sage Atri, as the son of Dharma-prajāpati or as rising out of the ocean of milk when it was being churned. Śiva wore him as his diadem. The 27 constellations of stars like Rohiṇī are described as his wives. His waxing and waning are due to a curse he got from his father-in-law, Dakṣa. His eclipse is due to his being swallowed by the demon Rāhu. He has special power over the vegetation on this earth. He is full of amṛta or nectar. That is why the gods drink him. He is replenished by the offerings in the sacrifices. He is the originator of the Candravaṁśa or the Lunar dynasty of which Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the last member.</p>
			<p>Works on Hindu Astrology consider him as one of the Navagrahas or nine planets, with a beneficial influence.</p>
			<p>Iconographically, he is represented with a face and two hands holding lotuses, sitting in a chariot of two or three wheels and drawn by ten horses.</p>
			<p>In the works on Yoga and tantras, Candra is described as the &#x2018;moon of mystery,&#x2019; full of nectar, existing just below the middle of the sahasrāra. By contemplating on him the yogi becomes fit to be adored by the world.</p>
			<p>Connection between the phases of the moon and the condition of mental patients has long been recognized by the Hindu works on health and sickness.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Once there was a dispute about Candra (moon) between Śiva who had worn him as his diadem and the nakṣatras (constellations) who were his wives. Brahmā mediated, divided Candra into two halves and distributed them to the disputants. The place in the Himālayas where this was done came to be known as &#x2018;Candrabhāgā.&#x2019; A river arose at that spot and it was also christened &#x2018;Candra-bhāgā.&#x2019; This is the story given in the Mahābhārata.</p>
			<p>Actually the river rises in the Himālayas in two streams, one being called Candrā and the other, Bhāgā. The two join at Taṇḍi and the united stream is known as Candrabhāgā. It is identified with the river Chenab now in Pakistan. It is called &#x2018;Asiknī&#x2019; in the Ṛgveda.</p>
			<p>Sāmba, the son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is said to have built a temple for Sūrya (sun) at the spot where it joins the river Sindhū (Indus).</p>
			<p>There is another small river of the same name in Orissa. At the place where it joins the bay of Bengal, the famous Sūrya temple of Koṇārka (Konarak) has been built.</p>
			<p>The river Bhīmā, a tributary of the Kṛṣṇā, in Maharashtra is also known as Candrabhāgā. The celebrated Viṭhoba temple is situated very near this river.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu itihāsas and purāṇas contain lots of historical material. Two dynasties, the Sūryavaṁśa and the Candravaṁśa (Solar and Lunar dynasties) have often been mentioned in these works.</p>
			<p>Candravaṁśa starts with Candra-Soma. His son was Budha from Iḷā, and was better known as Purūrava Aila. He became so famous and important that the Lunar dynasty is often stated to have commenced from him. He ruled from Pratiṣṭhāna (now a village Pihan by name, near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh). Nahuṣa, Yayāti and Pūru are the other celebrated rulers in this dynasty. The dynasty branched off with Yadu, the eldest son of Yayāti, into the Yādava dynasty, of which Balarāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa were the most famous descendants.</p>
			<p>Pūru&#x2019;s descendants came to be known as Pauravas. The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas belonged to this line.</p>
			<p>Ānavas and Haihayas were the other branches of the lunar race.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;[following] the phases of the moon&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras have described several kinds of prāyaścittas or expiations for sins of omission and commission. Cāndrāyaṇa is a universal expiation prescribed for almost any sin, especially where no other specific remedy has been suggested.</p>
			<p>The name is derived from the fact that in this expiation, the eating pattern follows the phases of the moon. Starting with 15 morsels of food (per day) on the full-moon, the same is gradually reduced by one morsel every day, ending in total fasting on the new-moon day. It is again increased, now from 1 to 15 morsels, till the full-moon day. This is one cycle. It can be repeated as many times as desired or needed. Since the quantity of food is full in the beginning and end, becoming nil at the middle, it is called &#x2018;pipīlikāmadhya&#x2019; or &#x2018;middle of an ant.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>If on the other hand, it is started with one morsel on the first day after the new-moon, increasing to 15 morsels on the full-moon and again reducing to nil on the new-moon, it is called &#x2018;yavamadhya&#x2019; or &#x2018;middle of the wheat grain.&#x2019; The similes are self-explanatory. Size of the morsel is that of a big myrobalan fruit.</p>
			<p>Prescribing 8 morsels of food per day and keeping the month as a unit period, other varieties of cāndrāyaṇa as yati-cāndrāyaṇa have been derived by permutations of the morsels.</p>
			<p>Tonsure of hair, initial fasting, offering libations of water and clarified butter, consecrating the sacrificial food and worship of moon—these are common disciplines for all the candrāyaṇas.</p>

			<p>The word &#x2018;candrikā&#x2019; which literally means moonlight, has often been used in a figurative sense to any literary work that throws a &#x2018;cool light&#x2019; on any subject. Two such works that are comparatively more well-known are the Candrikā of Jñānottama and the Candrikā of Vyāsatīrtha.</p>
			<p>The former is a commentary on the Naiṣkarmya Siddhi of Sureśvara (8th cent. A.D.), a disciple of Śaṅkara, by one Jñānottama, who was probably a pontiff of the Advaita-maṭha at Kāñcīpuram, and lived around A.D. 1300.</p>
			<p>The latter is actually an abbreviation for Tātparyacandrikā, a commentary by Vyāsatīrtha (A.D. 1447-1539) on the Tattva-prakāśikā of Jayatīrtha (14th cent. A.D.), this again being a commentary on Madhvācārya&#x2019;s (A. D. 1238-1317) Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Cāṅgadeva was a saint from Maha-rashtra who was a contemporary of the famous Sant Jñāneśvar (13th cent. A.D.). He was a haṭhayogi with several miraculous powers and a host of disciples. Having heard of the great fame of Sant Jñāneśvar he wanted to humiliate him by making a show of his power. He once flew through the air riding on a fierce tiger. Jñāneśvar who was then sitting on a mud wall, along with his brother Sopāna and sister Muktā-bāī, commanded the wall to fly and it did, carrying them all, much to the chagrin of the haṭhayogi! Cāṅgadeva surrendered. At the instance of Jñāneśvar, his younger sister Muktābāī initiated Cāṅgadeva into the mysteries of Jñānayoga. He became one of their most devoted disciples and has composed quite a few abhaṅgas in which he has described some of his mystic experiences got by their grace.</p>
			<p>There is another Cāṅgadeva who was a grandson of the great mathematician Bhāskarācārya (A. D. 1114-1160). He was the chief astrologer under Siṅghana (a Yādava king) and founded a college for the study of Siddhānta-śiromaṇi, Bhāskara&#x2019;s magnum opus.</p>

			<p>Caraka and Suśruta are the two brightest stars in the firmament of Āyurveda or the Science of Life. Due to several reasons including the destruction or plundering of valuable manuscripts by the various hordes, invading this country, it is very difficult to know about their period or original works.</p>
			<p>The Hindu traditions which ascribe the origin of Āyurveda to the creator Brahmā himself mention about the sage Ātreya Punarvasu and his brilliant disciple Agniveśa. Caraka is said to be the disciple of Agniveśa. Since his name has been mentioned in the epic Mahābhārata, some scholars assign him to the period 1400 B.C. Others however opine that Caraka was the court physician of Kāniṣka (3rd cent. A.D.), the Kuśāna king.</p>
			<p>His work Carakasaṁhitā, as it has come down to us today, is undoubtedly a much revised edition. Dṛḍhabala, a prominent writer (of Āyurveda), is said to have edited the earlier work and added several sections since the original was incomplete. It consists of eight prakaraṇas or sections divided into thirty chapters. It is exclusively a book of medicine and not of surgery.</p>
			<p>The contents of the eight prakaraṇas, very briefly, are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sūtrasthāna: origin of medicines; duties of the physician; use of medicines; cure of diseases; materia medica; diet.</li>
				<li>Nidānasthāna: curing of diseases like fever, tumours, diabetes, leprosy, tuberculosis, manias and epilepsy.</li>
				<li>Vimānasthāna: epidemics; nature of food; symptoms and diagnosis of diseases; use of medicines; peculiarities of the fluids of the body.</li>
				<li>Śarīrasthāna: nature of the soul; conception; varieties of species; qualities of elements; description of the body; connection of body and the soul.</li>
				<li>Indriyasthāna: organs of senses and their diseases; loss of strength and death.</li>
				<li>Cikitsāsthāna: diseases like dropsy, swelling, piles, jaundice, asthma, dysentery and effects of poisons; means of improving health and enjoying long life.</li>
				<li>Kalpasthāna: emetics, purgatives, antidotes and medical charms.</li>
				<li>Siddhisthāna: evacuating medi-cines, injections, abscesses and other topics.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is a remarkable work written in the campū (mixture of prose and poetry) style. Even mental illnesses and epidemic diseases have been dealt with in detail. It has been translated into Persian and Arabic languages in the 8th cent. A. D. There are 17 commentaries on it in Sanskrit.</p>

			<p>The cult of Vīraśaivism, with its philosophy of Śakti-viśiṣṭādvaita, took a definite shape during the middle ages in the province of Karnataka. But it is rooted in the ancient schools of Śaivism.</p>
			<p>According to it, &#x2018;Sthala&#x2019; or the Absolute (equivalent of Brahman) with its &#x2018;Śakti&#x2019; or inherent power divides itself into &#x2018;aṅga&#x2019; (the jīva) and &#x2018;liṅga&#x2019; (Para or Paramātman). &#x2018;Caraliṅga&#x2019;, also called &#x2018;jaṅgamaliṅga&#x2019;, is one of the aspects of this liṅga. Since the human body is animated by Paramātman and is capable of movement (cara or jaṅgama = that which moves), it is called &#x2018;caraliṅga&#x2019; or &#x2018;jaṅgamaliṅga&#x2019;.</p>

			<p>Rāmānuja&#x2019;s (A. D. 1017-1137) teachings are twofold. The philosophical aspect is known as Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta. The practical, religious, aspect is called Śrīvaiṣṇavism.</p>
			<p>Śrīvaiṣṇavism lays great emphasis on bhakti (devotion to God) and prapatti (self-surrender) as the two parallel means of attaining mokṣa or liberation.</p>
			<p>Prapatti depends upon receiving the rahasyatraya (&#x2018;the three secrets&#x2019;) from a qualified preceptor and practising the same.</p>
			<p>They are: aṣṭākṣarīmantra, dvaya-mantra and caramaśloka. (See <ref>AṢṬĀKṢARĪ</ref> and <ref>DVAYAMANTRA</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>The caramaśloka is the 66th verse in the last chapter of the Bhagavadgītā (18.66). Though it is not the last in the section, since it contains the ultimate or final (= carama) message of Śrīkṛṣṇa, it has been designated as such.</p>
			<p>The verse is:</p>
			<p type="poem">sarvadharmān parityajya<br />māmekaṁ śaraṇam vraja |<br />ahaṁ tvā sarvapāpebhyo<br />mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ ||</p>

			<p>The word &#x2018;caraṇa&#x2019; has been used in several senses like: foot, a quarter of verse, pillar of a temple and part of a musical composition (in Carnatic music).</p>
			<p>In the Vedic terminology, it refers to a branch of the Veda (in a much larger sense) and the group of people who study it. It includes not only the particular śākhā (the branch or recension of Veda traditionally allotted to them for specialization) but also its allied literature like the law-books.</p>
			<p>In Buddhism it refers to the eight aspects of character like fearlessness and self-control, fit to be cultivated.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Vedic seers have accepted the princi-ple that revelation is a continuing process. Hence the volume of revealed mantras that constitute the Vedas went on growing, gradually reaching such levels that were beyond the normal ranges of human memory. It thus became necessary to compile index-works and appendices that would help the memorization process or locate the needed information. Anukrama-ṇikās and pariśiṣṭas are such works. The caraṇavyūhas belong to the latter group.</p>
			<p>Among the two caraṇavyūhas extant, the first belongs to Śukla Yajurveda and is said to be the work of Kātyāyana. This lists the various śākhās or branches of that Veda. The work as it obtains today seems to be of later origin and its list is incomplete.</p>
			<p>The second one is the 49th pariśiṣṭa of the Atharvaveda. It mentions the chief characteristics of the Atharvaveda and gives the number of the mantras as 12,380 included in 2000 sūktas. The ṛṣis (sages) and devatās (deities) of the mantras are also mentioned.</p>
			<p>For each śākhā of the Vedas, the caraṇavyūhas mention the names of the related Brāhmaṇas, Āraṇyakas, Sūtras, Upaveda etc.</p>
			<p>There is a work called Caraṇavyūha-sūtra attributed to Śaunaka giving the details of the four Vedas, their śākhas and allied literature in five chapters.</p>

			<p>Caru is one of the several materials normally used in Vedic sacrifices for oblation. It is a kind of porridge prepared from unpounded rice or barley grains by cooking it in water and mixing it with butter or milk. It is used for oblation and also consumed by four of the priests specified in the sacrificial works. It is sometimes substituted for puroḍāśa (a kind of rice-cake used for offering) in the subsidiary or modified rites called &#x2018;vikṛtis&#x2019;. The vessel used for keeping or serving it is also called caru and sometimes as carusthālī.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;philosophy of those who speak sweetly&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Schools of Indian materialism, of various hues and shades, are generally called Cārvākadarśana or Lokāyatamata. Whether there was a real founder of this school by name Cārvāka is difficult to prove; probably not. The name of Bṛhaspati, son of Loka, is sometimes mentioned as the founder of this system.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Cārvāka&#x2019; itself has been interpreted as &#x2018;one who speaks sweetly&#x2019; (from cāru = sweet, vāk = speech) or as one who lives &#x2018;to eat&#x2019; (from carv = to eat or enjoy). The term &#x2018;Lokāyata&#x2019; means &#x2018;restricted to the world of common experience&#x2019;. Both these names refer to the nature of this system.</p>
			<p>There are no extant basic texts of this school. Information has to be gleaned from various other works which state these views sometimes even quoting from their works, with the sole purpose of contradicting and criticizing them.</p>
			<p>The Cārvāka system accepts pratyakṣa or direct perception as the only pramāṇa or valid source of knowledge, rejecting even anumāna or inference. Consequently it admits of only four elements—pṛthvī (earth), ap (water), tejas (fire) and vāyu (air)—as the fundamental substances constituting the world. It denies the existence of God and soul. Consciousness, according to it, is a chemical product of the combination of the elements that make up the body. Kāma or pleasure here and now, is the only goal of life. Artha or wealth is a means to it. One is advised to get the maximum pleasure out of life, before it is too late. In this process no attention need be paid to dharma, any moral or ethical scruples. Mokṣa or emancipation is a myth. Since death is the end of life and there is no rebirth, life need not be &#x2018;all labour&#x2019; except for what is necessary to get pleasure.</p>
			<p>The Cārvākas are sometimes classified into two groups: dhūrtas or the crass ones and suśikṣitas or the cultured ones. The former are base materialists interested only in the crude satisfaction of beastly instincts. The latter as represented by Vātsyāyana and others, accept dharma or righteousness also along with artha and kāma, and stress the need for self-control and discipline in life.</p>
			<p>Whatever be their defect, the Cārvākas have certainly forced the later philosophers to give up dogmatism and spurred their free thinking.</p>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Though human beings come all alone into this world and return to the Abode of their Father in Heaven, also alone, they cannot live alone here! It is in their very nature to create a family or a group, to live with. However, when their gregarious instinct makes their herds grow into crowds, divisions into smaller groups become inevitable. Various factors may contribute to this division: professions, racial features, beliefs and customs carried over from the ancient generations, status consciousness brought about by economic well-being or higher levels of education and culture, and so on.</p>
			<p>People all over the world have been subjected to this phenomenon.</p>
			<p>Nor have such groups, clans and tribes remained static and unaffected by the vicissitudes of time and life. Terrific changes brought about by variegated experiences, the impact of the different ways and values of life of other groups, growth or deterioration of civilization and culture or even unexpected upheavals from inside their own groups have often wrought permanent transformations in them. Such groups as were incapable of withstanding the shocks of changes, have either been decimated or have been devoured and digested by the more aggressive ones.</p>
			<p>The one social system that has successfully withstood all the onslaughts from without and within, over several millennia, is the caste system of the Hindus. If similar systems that existed in Greece, Rome, Persia or Japan have quietly disappeared into oblivion and only the Hindu system has survived, it speaks volumes for not only its resilience and tenacity, but also for its having fulfilled a great need and purpose of the Hindu peoples. This point will be dealt with later.</p>
			<p>It may not be irrelevant to mention here a notion that we normally have—that the Semitic religions are monolithic and do not have any social system that is comparable to the Hindu caste system. It is true that—unlike the Hindu religion—they have only one founder and one Book. But one will be surprised to know that there are numerous varieties or schools of Christianity and that, in India at least, there are several castes even among the Muslims!<aside>M. N. Srinivas, <em>Caste in Modern India</em>, Bombay, Media Promoters &amp; Publishers Pvt. Ltd., 1994, pp. 88 and 108.</aside></p>
			<h3>Varṇa, the Basis of the Caste System</h3>
			<p>The division of the Hindu society into four broad groups, known as varṇas is now a well-recognized fact.</p>
			<p>Though the word &#x2018;varṇa&#x2019; has been used in the sense of &#x2018;colour&#x2019; of the skin, in the earlier sections of the Ṛgveda wherein the Āryans (fair in colour) and the Dasyus (of dark skin) have been divided into two eternally warring groups, it soon lost this sense.</p>
			<p>The fourfold varṇa system goes back to the Ṛgveda Saṁhitā itself (vide 8.35.16.7; 1.10.8.7). To make a living by choosing a profession as per one&#x2019;s desire and aptitude is a common phenomenon seen in all civilized societies. It is the duty of the society to provide suitable opportunities for its members to choose and pursue those vocations that agree with their nature. This is the philosophy behind the varṇa system. The Vedas, including the Puruṣasūkta (wherein this fourfold division of the society has been enunciated very clearly) have only recognized its existence and not created it.</p>
			<p>As a society grows in size and civilization, there has got to be a division of labour since all persons cannot do all things. In the early Vedic period, this division of labour might have taken place on a voluntary basis even as the members of a family do so on any important occasion affecting the whole family. Some chose the occupation of accumulating knowledge, wisdom and culture, and training the younger generation in them. They became the brāhmaṇas. Those who were physically sturdy and strong, took to arms to protect the society from external aggression as also maintain internal law and order. They were the kṣattriyas. A great majority of the rest devoted themselves to the production and distribution of wealth and goods through agriculture, dairy-farming, trade and commerce. They were called the vaiśyas. The others who could not fit into any of these vocations made a living by supplying manual labour and serving others. They became the śūdras. In course of time, each of these varṇas—from the brāhmaṇas to the śūdras—acquired hierarchical superiority over the succeeding ones.</p>
			<p>Though this was a natural process based on guṇa (aptitude) and karma (vocation chosen as per that aptitude), it was more a general rule and an ideal one at that. It was almost impossible to estimate the guṇa of every individual and assign an appropriate karma to him. (What about a baby that is just born?) Hence birth in a varṇa became an easier and a more practicable principle to fix up the varṇa of that individual. This was the beginning of the jāti system—now called the &#x2018;caste system&#x2019;—wherein the varṇa got automatically fixed by birth (jāti = birth).</p>
			<p>Though the varṇa of a person had been assigned to him by virtue of his birth into it, there is enough evidence to surmise that one had enough freedom to choose one&#x2019;s calling. Viśvāmitra and Vītahavya who were kṣattriya kings chose to become brāhmaṇa sages by their Vedic learning and austerity. Paraśurāma and Droṇā-cārya, on the other hand, took to arms and fighting as their profession and became—for all practical purposes—kṣattriyas, retaining their brāhmaṇahood only in name. However, these conversions seem to be rather an exception.</p>
			<h3>Growth of the Caste System</h3>
			<p>Human nature being prone to sense attraction and sex desire, the general rule of endogamy among the varṇas was often violated. Hence anuloma marriages—marriages of the men of the higher varṇas with the women of the lower ones—became common and had to be accorded legal sanction. On the other hand, pratiloma marriages—the reverse of the anuloma ones—could not be prevented, though frowned upon. This led to what is technically known as &#x2018;varṇasaṅkara&#x2019; (mixing up of the varṇas or the castes) ultimately giving rise to a plethora of mixed castes.</p>
			<p>Even by the time of the great epic, the Mahābhārata (circa 3000 B. C.), the problem of varṇasaṅkara had become stupendous. Incessant invasions from outside, by people of other races and cultures like the Greeks, the Hūṇas, the Śakas, the Scythians, the Persians and others who often settled down in India and got integrated into the Hindu society, also contributed to the multiplication of the castes.</p>
			<p>While the law-givers, the authors of the smṛtis and dharmaśāstras (secondary scriptural works) were struggling to invent new names for those innumerable castes, and even subcastes, the natural flow of time and human history came to their rescue, at least in one way. Increase of population and development of civilization necessitated the manufacture of many new implements, instruments and devices for greater comforts and smoother living. This led to a multiplication of new professions, automatically absorbing more and more number of persons into them. They became the new castes. That the nomenclatures of many castes and subcastes contain a direct or indirect reference to their professions is proof enough, of this development. Over the decades or even centuries, a very high degree of specialization took place in these skills and professions.</p>
			<h3>Positive Aspects of the Caste System</h3>
			<p>It has become a fashionable pastime for anyone who considers himself as modern, to rail against the caste system. People are not wanting who &#x2018;discover&#x2019; in it, the &#x2018;sinister machinations&#x2019; of the &#x2018;clever and crooked&#x2019; brāhmaṇas to keep a whole nation under slavish subjugation. How a handful of people, who had neither military might nor the power of wealth to back them up, could keep millions under their thumb for millennia, except by the sheer power of their noble character and a life dedicated to the welfare of all, does not seem to penetrate their prejudiced brains. Impartial savants, whether from the West or from the East, have showered encomiums on this system which has survived many a brutal onslaught over the centuries. Sidney Low in his Vision of India (2nd edn., 1907, pp. 262-263) eloquently praises it thus:</p>
			<p>&#x2018;There is no doubt that it is the main cause of the fundamental stability and contentment by which Indian society has been braced up for centuries against the shocks of politics and the cataclysms of Nature. It provides every man with his place, his career, his occupation, his circle of friends. It makes him at the outset a member of a corporate body, it protects him through life from the canker of social jealousy and unfulfilled aspirations; it ensures him companionship and a sense of community with others in like case with himself. The caste organization is to the Hindu his club, his trade union, his benefit society, his philanthropic society. There are no workhouses in India and none are as yet needed.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>This is what Abbe Dubois (A. D. 1770-1848), a Christian missionary from France, who lived in close touch with the Indians of all castes for over fifteen years, has to say on the same subject:</p>
			<p><aside>Quoted from: P. V. Kane, <em>History of Dharmaśāstra</em>, Vol. II, pt. 1, Edn. 1941, Poona, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, p. 20.</aside>&#x2018;I consider the institution of castes among the Hindu nations as the happiest effort of their legislation; and I am well convinced that, if the people of India never sunk into a state of barbarism, and if, when almost all Europe was plunged in that dreary gulf, India kept up her head, preserved and extended the sciences, the arts and civilization, it is wholly to the distinction of castes that she is indebted for that high celebrity.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Here is another quotation from Swami Vivekananda, the great prophet of Modern India:</p>
			<p>&#x2018;We believe in Indian caste as one of the greatest social institutions that the Lord gave to man. We also believe that though the unavoidable defects, foreign persecutions, and above all, the monumental ignorance and pride of many brāh-maṇas who do not deserve the name, have thwarted in many ways, the legitimate fructification of this most glorious Indian institution, it has already worked wonders for the land of Bharata and is destined to lead Indian humanity to its goal.&#x2019;<aside><em>India and Her problems</em>, Edn. 1992, Mayavati, Advaita Ashrama, p. 63.</aside></p>
			<p>An unbiased study of the reasons for the survival of the caste system can easily reveal its positive and constructive aspects thus:</p>
			<ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>It has given social security to every member of the caste by instilling a sense of belonging even from his early childhood days.</li>
				<li>It has, in an easy and natural way, given excellent training in the parti-cular trade or profession, since the whole family is engaged in it. Most often, since people of the same caste, practising a particular profession, lived in colonies of their own, the very atmosphere was congenial to this training. This has automatically eliminated the problem of unemployment which has assumed alarming proportions now.</li>
				<li>It has abolished unhealthy and cut-throat competition in the trade due to the cooperative efforts of the entire community.</li>
				<li>Endogamous marriages within the community have further strengthened the social bonds among the various members, thus safeguarding the interest of the individual even in emergencies.</li>
				<li>A clear demarcation of the duties and obligations of each caste group towards the society in general and a recognition of the rights and privileges of each group by the others in particular, conduced to peaceful coexistence over several centuries.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Gradual Decadence of the Caste System</h3>
			<p>There is no gainsaying the fact that during the last 150 years, there has been a gradual decline of the true spirit behind the caste system. It has been much more pronounced during the 50 years after our political independence. These may be listed as follows:</p>
			<ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>Men decay where wealth accumulates. Concentration of power leads to corruption. The brāhmaṇas and the kṣattriyas, developed vested interests in their position, status and power, which had helped them to better their worldly prospects. Instead of striving to serve the society through these, they tried to subju-gate it for selfish ends. It naturally produced reactions and caste conflicts. In fact, these conflicts have spread even to the so-called lower castes, each of which trying to establish its &#x2018;superiority&#x2019; over the others.</li>
				<li>Forgetting their duties and obligations to the society as a whole, people have started asserting their rights and privileges and fighting for them. This has led to the disturbance of the equilibrium and peace of the social structure.</li>
				<li>The import of science and techno-logy from the West, with its concomitants of less work, more leisure and greater material comforts, has had a devastating effect on the Indian society. The need-based pattern of life has yielded its place to a greed-based one, thus sowing unrest in all fields of life.</li>
				<li>As a result, all sections of the society including the brāhmaṇas—the original custodians of religion, ethical and spiritual values—have forsaken their great and time-tested ideals and have fallen a prey to the sensate culture of the machine-made civilization, of the West.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before taking up a study of the remedial measures, it is better to turn our attention to the original Brāhmaṇa Ideal, to which everybody in the society was expected to be raised, in course of time.</p>
			<h3>The Brāhmaṇa Ideal</h3>
			<p>The strength and stamina of any society depends not so much on its physical vigour and vitality or its economic power as on the general personal character of the individuals it comprises. People who are endowed with a will that inspires them, &#x2018;to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield,&#x2019; are the real wealth of a nation. Such a high degree of evolution cannot be achieved in a day. It may take decades, nay, even centuries to do so. And, this needs highly evolved, ideal, persons who become the models for others to emulate. Not only that, they should actively train and guide the rest of the society by their work, example and precept.</p>
			<p>It is exactly this that the ancient sages of India, the founding fathers of Vedic religion and philosophy, did, when they gave us the varṇa system with the brāhmaṇa ideal as its pinnacle of glory.</p>
			<p>A brāhmaṇa was, first of all, to be a &#x2018;brahmavid,&#x2019; a knower of Brahman, a knower of God. Since &#x2018;Brahman&#x2019; or the Vedas (which taught the science of the Spirit), was the means to it, a brāhmaṇa was commanded to master it and then spread its wisdom to the worthy disciples that may approach him for the same.</p>
			<p>A life of the spirit leads to the life in the Spirit, called Brahman. This means, maximizing the intellectual, moral and spiritual (or soul) powers through tapas or austerity, enabling one to ultimately reach that goal. Since the physical body, the sense-organs and an unripe mind as also a wild ego are capable of knocking down even highly evolved spiritual aspirants, the brāhmaṇa is urged to spare no efforts in chastising and subjugating them. Thus a brāhmaṇa has to wage a relentless war on two fronts simultaneously—to control the physical instincts and to raise the mind to higher levels.</p>
			<p>In every country, a soldier who is prepared to lay down his life in defending it, is given certain prerogatives and privileges; and, rightly so. Then, why not accord the same to these noble souls who have willingly forsaken their personal comforts and luxuries for the sake of an ideal that ultimately helps the entire society? Recog-nizing this, the smṛtis and the dharma-śāstras (scriptures considered as next in importance to the Vedas and guiding the lives of people in all its aspects) have given some rights and privileges to the brāhmaṇa.</p>
			<p>A brāhmaṇa is primarily expected to study the Vedas, teach it to others competent to acquire its knowledge and lead a contemplative life. He may be an expert in several branches of sciences and arts and train others in them without expecting any fee for the same. He may, if he chooses, act as a priest in sacrifices conducted by others or perform them himself. On such occasions he is free to accept gifts and also bestow them on others.</p>
			<p>He is not normally expected to practise remunerative professions except in times of great distress. Hence it is the duty of the society—especially the kṣattriya kings and the well-to-do vaiśyas—to maintain him, as also his family and disciples, if he is running a gurukula (forest academy). The king should not collect taxes from him and should exempt him from the general laws of the land. Punishment for transgressions, if any, must be very mild. On all occasions in general and during religious festivals in particular, the brāhmaṇa should get precedence over others and a place of honour and veneration.</p>
			<h3>The Brāhmaṇa in Actual Life</h3>
			<p>From the foregoing description it should not be surmised that the brāhmaṇa was above the laws of the land and hence a law unto himself! His own pure conscience being the best judge, the brāhmaṇa often applied the rules to himself even more ruthlessly than he wished for the others. The story of Śaṅkha and Likhita (vide Mahābhārata, Śāntiparva, ch. 23), is a case to the point.</p>
			<p>Human nature being rather fragile, easily subject to the weaknesses of the flesh and lucre, not all the brāhmaṇas could keep to the superhuman ideals expected of them. As they gradually slided down from the lofty ideals, they took to other means of living as were prescribed for the kṣattriyas and vaiśyas, like fighting, agriculture, trade and commerce. As long as they sincerely struggled to keep up the Vedic studies and also lead a simple and austere life, the smṛtis and dharma-śāstras (of later periods) permitted them to do so.</p>
			<p>During further periods of decline of their brāhmaṇahood, they advocated the theory of the superiority of a brāhmaṇa just by birth and started claiming the privileges as of old, as a matter of right.<aside>&#x2018;While finding fault with the brāhmaṇa writers of over two thousand years ago, for the eulogies they bestowed upon themselves, one should not forget that even in the 20th century when the pursuit of scientific studies is professed to have reached its zenith, we hear ecstatic and arrogant achievements of the Nordic race and the greater and more glorious future it is destined to attain (<em>vide</em> the very first sentence in Spengler&#x2019;s <em>The Decline of the West</em>, English translation by S. F. Atkinson). The brāhmaṇas never arrogated to themselves the authority to depose kings and to hand over vast territories forever to whomsoever they liked, as Pope Alexander VI by his Bull of 1493 made over the New World to Isabella of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon (<em>vide</em> Dean Inge, <em>Christian Ethics</em>, Edn. 1930, p. 160, where this astounding Bull is set out).&#x2019;</aside></p>
			<p>This had a twofold deleterious effect: They contributed to their own spiritual damnation. They also generated unhealthy reactions from the other members of the society. Gradually they lost their privileges. They were forced to obey the general laws of the land as others.</p>
			<p>Since the brāhmaṇas were the trend-setters for the society—it being universally conceded that they represented the Ideal Man—their forsaking the spiritual ideals of human excellence, had a catastrophic effect on the whole society. If today the Hindu society in general is sunk in the quagmire of corruption, nepotism and immorality, much of the blame should be apportioned to the brāhmaṇas themselves.</p>
			<h3>The Śūdra Problem</h3>
			<p>If in the original varṇa system, the brāhmaṇa stood at the top of the ladder of social hierarchy, the śūdra occupied the bottom rung.</p>
			<p>Who exactly the śūdras were, has been a point of discussion and debate among scholars, especially the sociologists and the anthropologists. As per the original varṇa system, the śūdras were very much a part and parcel of the Āryan society. Though they earned their livelihood by physical labour and service to the other three varṇas they did enjoy social status and honour. In the early Vedic society rules about inter-dining and inter-marriage do not seem to have been very stringent. The brāhmaṇas could employ the śūdras as cooks (vide Āpastamba Dharmasūtras, 2.2.3.4) and could accept their invitation for dinner if they were their own servants or tillers of their land or even their family friends (vide Gautama Dharmasūtras 17.1 and 6). Some authorities like Bādari even allowed them to establish Vedic fires or have the saṁskāras (religious sacraments) performed.</p>
			<p>From all these we can perhaps conclude that except for keeping the Vedic fires and studying or teaching the Vedas, they were allowed to live a decent life like any other member of the Āryan society. And, they were certainly entitled to the acquisition of spiritual knowledge and wisdom, though not through the Vedas, but through the secondary works like the itihāsas and the purāṇas.</p>
			<p>However, things did change for the worse, for the śūdras as time rolled by. Their freedom got gradually curtailed. Their social disabilities were multiplied. Their honour and dignity were lowered. Some sections from among them were even branded as untouchables, segregated from the general society and forced to live outside the towns and villages. Punishments for transgressions against the higher varṇas became more and more severe. Legal protection became less effective.</p>
			<p>The gradual decline of the śūdras in the hierarchy of the Āryan society might have been due to several causes:</p>
			<p>As the general population increased, that of the śūdras also naturally swelled. An unconscious fear of their numerical strength might have induced the upper classes of the society to impose greater restrictions on them.</p>
			<p>Offsprings of the anuloma and prati-loma marriages along with those of clandestine unions as also the parents of the latter, were relegated to the śūdra class. Persons of the upper varṇas guilty of heinous sins, were also pushed down into the śūdra class. They being renegades, the brāhmaṇas were perhaps unwilling to give them the facilities that the śūdras enjoyed earlier.</p>
			<p>Invading tribes of foreign origin when they decided to stay on in India and get domiciled, could neither be ignored nor assimilated completely. Hence they might have grudgingly been given a place among the śūdras. Since they were totally alien to the local religion and culture, restrictions had to be placed on them to protect the Āryan way of life from being adversely affected.</p>
			<h3>Untouchability</h3>
			<p>Along with the decline of the śūdras there appeared in the Hindu society, an evil practice worse than the ones known so far—that of aspṛśyatā or untouchability. Neither during the Vedic period, nor during the period of the early dharma-śāstras, was untouchability mentioned, much less practised. Even the cāṇḍālas, considered the lowest in the social rank, were counted only among the śūdras.</p>
			<p>How and when exactly the practice began, it is difficult to say. Ceremonial impurity as on the birth or death in a family was fairly well-known. Contact with unclean objects or persons made a person &#x2018;aspṛśya&#x2019; or untouchable, but a bath could remedy the defect.</p>
			<p>Gradually, the notion must have gained ground that certain persons constantly engaged in very unclean occupations like cleaning human ordure, butchery and sale of meat, tanning and so on—which were a health hazard for others—had to be segregated and treated as untouchables in the best interest of the society as a whole. Hence they were made to live outside the towns and villages and their entry and movements were restricted.<aside>Compare this with the most brutal treatment meted out to the Bushmen of Africa and Australia, and the Negroes of America by the European races, merely due to racial prejudice.</aside> What might have begun thus was, unfortunately, extended to all the persons of those castes later on, even though they might have been engaged in more decent occupations.</p>
			<p>That untouchability is a blot on the Hindu society has been conceded by one and all. Vigorous efforts have been made by the teachers of the Bhakti Schools like Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya (A. D. 1485-1533) earlier and by Nārāyaṇa Guru (A. D. 1854-1928) and Mahātmā Gāndhī (A. D. 1869-1948) in recent history, to eliminate it and restore a place of dignity to these unfortunate persons.</p>
			<h3>Solution to the Caste Problem in Modern India</h3>
			<p>In spite of all the encomiums heaped upon the Caste System by a few far-sighted savants of the East and the West, it is an undeniable fact that serious situations are, off and on, arising out of it (as it obtains now), sometimes creating law and order problems too! The caste consciousness has become so deep-rooted in the psyche of our people that even among the so-called untouchable classes, some sections are claiming &#x2018;superiority&#x2019; over other sections! The problem has further been compounded by selfish and narrow-minded political and social leaders, ever eager to fish in troubled waters. Various laws enacted by the governments—whether at the Centre or in the States—though done with the best of intentions, have not had the desired impact on the society.</p>
			<p>One of the solutions that is often &#x2018;graciously&#x2019; given by many a leader in social life is that the system itself should be scrapped. It is akin to advising the abolition of all the political systems since none has really helped humanity perfectly. (Or, why not cut off the head, to get rid of headaches?!)</p>
			<p>In fact some of the religious leaders of the medieval ages (of India) who tried this method, not only failed in their efforts, but ultimately ended up in adding one more caste along with many subcastes to the already existing ones!</p>
			<p>Even in countries that have no caste system as we have in India, social tensions and violent conflicts have not disappeared. Racial riots, sectarian violence and even religious conflicts among people professing the same religion are the order of the day.</p>
			<p>Hence the solution of abolishing the caste system itself is worse than the problem it is supposed to solve.</p>
			<p>Wisdom lies in a reappraisal of the entire system over the centuries, discover the various loopholes and plug them, and also improve the system itself in other ways so that we can get the best out of it. Let us not forget that it has successfully worked for over five millennia or even more!</p>
			<p>The causes of all conflicts among the human beings, including those rooted in caste-consciousness, are basically two: selfishness and egoism. If and when one caste group succeeds in getting better off in life, both economically and culturally, it also succeeds in rousing the wrath of other caste groups that may be lagging behind. False pride and hurt-feelings roused by the progress of other castes may also be responsible for initiating friction, tensions and conflicts.</p>
			<p>The best and the only remedy for this is good education for all the people of our country. Education can be the panacea for many an evil in our society. However, this education, apart from giving general knowledge and proficiency in some calling, should also give a person refinement and culture through the imparting of moral, ethical and spiritual values. In other words dharma, in its true sense, must become an integral part of an education system. If and when such an education makes all the people feel that they are one people belonging to a great country and are endowed with tremendous potentialities to raise themselves from the brute level to the human level, and ultimately to the divine level, they will become an invaluable asset to the whole of humanity. In fact, it was exactly this ideal that our ancient sages envisaged when they attempted to raise everyone ultimately to the level of the ideal brāhmaṇa, through their propagation of the varṇa system and eulogy of the true brāhmaṇa. And, many of these great ones like Vyāsa, Vālmīki or Vasiṣṭha, were themselves not brāhmaṇas by birth!</p>
			<p>Most unfortunately, during the last few decades, a virulent and systematic propaganda has been mounted by certain non-brāhmaṇa leaders against the brāhmaṇas, blaming them for all the ills that have afflicted their own societies. It is best to quote in reply, Swami Vivekananda (who himself was not a brāhmaṇa by caste) here:</p>
			<p><aside>Swami Vivekananda, <em>India and Her Problems</em>, Edn. 1992, Mayavati, Advaita Ashrama, pp. 67, 69, 70.</aside>&#x2018;Therefore, it is no use fighting among the castes...It will divide us all the more, weaken us all the more, degrade us all the more. The solution is not by bringing down the higher, but by raising the lower upto the level of the higher. And that is the line of work found in all our books...The ideal at one end is the brāhmaṇa and the ideal at the other end is the cāṇḍāla, and the whole work is to raise the cāṇḍāla upto the brāhmaṇa. Slowly and slowly you find more and more privileges granted to them.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;It is true that he (the brāhmaṇa) was the earliest preacher to the Indian races, he was the first to renounce everything in order to attain the higher realization of life, before others could reach to the idea. It was not his fault that he marched ahead of the other castes. Why did not the other castes so understand and do as they did? Why did they sit down and be lazy, and let the brāhmaṇas win the race?</p>
			<p>&#x2018;To the non-brāhmaṇa castes I say, wait, be not in a hurry. Do not seize every opportunity of fighting the brāhmaṇa, because as I have shown, you are suffering from your own fault. Who told you to neglect spirituality and Sanskrit learning? What have you been doing all this time?...Why do you not spend millions to bring Sanskrit education to all the castes of India? ...The moment you do these things you are equal to the brāhmaṇa. That is the secret power of India.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Vivekananda, during his days, vigorously advocated the study of Sanskrit by all, because according to him, Sanskrit education brought with it refinement and culture, by opening up the entire treasure for our ancient religio-cultural literature.</p>
			<p>Another problem which is intimately connected with caste conflicts is that of inter-dining and inter-marriage among the castes. Though inter-dining in urban India seems to have become common, it is still a taboo in the rural areas. As for inter-caste marriages it is not at all common even in the urban areas.</p>
			<p>In the rural areas it is not only frowned upon even now but has often led to violent conflicts. With all the propaganda in favour of inter-caste marriages by the government media, people in general are yet to accept the concept. Attitudes among the common people have hardened to such an extent that inter-marriages even among the sub-groups of the same caste are not favoured. It being a rather sensitive issue, one has to tread very slowly and carefully. As Vivekananda avers<aside>Swami Vivekananda, <em>The Complete Works</em>, Mayavati, Advaita Ashrama, Vol. 5, pp. 405, 406.</aside>, the unity moves should begin at the levels of subcastes and subgroups, gradually integrating them into the main varṇas, thus restoring the original four varṇa system. At the same time the notion of privileges should be given the go-by and the duties of everyone towards the society as a whole must be stressed. Of course, the right type of education imparted from the young age can achieve this in course of time.</p>
			<p>If the brāhmaṇas show the way, by returning to a life of &#x2018;simple living and high thinking,&#x2019; by producing from among themselves great persons of sterling character, the balance in the society also can be restored more easily and quickly.</p>
			<h3>Epilogue</h3>
			<p>To sum up:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The Hindu caste system is a natural growth and evolution from within the varṇa system, from the Vedic culture and the Āryan society.</li>
				<li>It has imparted stability to the Hindu society and has successfully survived for over five or six millennia in spite of the repeated invasions against India.</li>
				<li>Its decadence started first by the forsaking of the spiritual ideal by the brāhmaṇas for pelf and power; and later by the impact of Western civilization and culture centred round heavy machines and emphasis on greater physical comforts.</li>
				<li>The caste system as such need not be and should not be given up. Right attitudes must be created in the minds of people by imparting proper education and culture to eliminate mutual suspicions and animosities and cultivate a sense of social responsibility towards all sections of the society.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>An example can make this point clear. Suppose in a family, the last child has been handicapped; will its elder brothers and sisters throw it into the well thinking it is a useless child and a burden upon them? On the other hand, they will lavish extra love and affection on it, to bring it up and make it happy. In exactly the same way, if the forward sections of the society—those who are economically, educationally and culturally forward—take some extra trouble for the upliftment of the weaker sections, not only will the latter be happy but the former too will be happy by the joy of fulfilment of their efforts. And, all social tensions will automatically disappear into the thin air.</p>
			<p>Did not Lord Buddha declare 2500 years ago that hatred begets hatred and only love can conquer hatred? Why not give a fair trial to such an eternal truth that has stood the test of time?</p>
			<p>Once the people wake up to these simple truths and practise them seriously, the social equilibrium and peace will easily be restored. And caste, instead of being a problem, will become an asset that may be coveted by other nations too!</p>

			<p>The Hindu scriptures, by and large, have given a very high status to the king, even calling him as &#x2018;pratyakṣa-devatā&#x2019; (&#x2018;visible deity&#x2019;). It was his primary duty and responsibility to protect the lives, properties, honour and religion of his subjects at any cost. Whatever he did for discharging this, was considered dharma or righteousness, as long as he had no selfish or impure motives.</p>
			<p>For this, he was advised to employ four kinds of &#x2018;upāyas&#x2019; or means which were technically called &#x2018;guṇas.&#x2019; They are: sāma (conciliation), dāna (concessions, favours and gifts), bheda (dissensions) and daṇḍa (conflict and war).</p>
			<p>The enemies of the State could be internal or external, the former being considered as the more dangerous. The king was advised to make use of the daṇḍopāya as the last resort. He was to try for conciliation through sweet words, concessions, favours and gifts. If these did not have the desired effect, then he should secretly try to bring about dissensions among the enemies and trouble-makers through spies of proven loyalty. Daṇḍa or war was to be the last resort.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Certain Vedic sacrifices belonging to the &#x2018;iṣṭi&#x2019; group (See <ref>IṢṬI</ref>.) are known as &#x2018;cāturmāsya&#x2019; since these sacrifices have to be repeated every four months. They are: Vaiśvadeva, Varuṇapraghāsa, Sākamedha and Śunāsīrīya. (See under the respective titles for details.) Each is called a &#x2018;parvan&#x2019; or a part of the Cāturmāsyas. They were performed respectively on the full-moon days of Phālguna or Caitra (February—April), Āṣāḍha (July), Kārttika (November) and on the fifth full-moon from the day on which the Sākamedha is performed. Obviously these are the beginnings of the spring, monsoon and autumn seasons. The Maruts were the most prominent deities receiving offerings in all of them with the set of gods peculiar to each. The attainment of heaven was the promised fruit. These sacrifices could be performed either throughout one&#x2019;s life or for one year only.</p>
			<p>The four months of the rainy season are also called &#x2018;cāturmāsya&#x2019;. A &#x2018;vrata&#x2019; or a religious observance, has been prescribed for these months for those who are interested, by the smṛtis and dharma-śāstras. It begins with a saṅkalpa or resolve on the 11th or the 12th day of the bright half of Āṣāḍha (July), or on the full-moon day. During these four months, the person under the vow, should desist from consuming some specified edibles like vegetables, curds and milk, and give up some luxuries such as cot. It is to be concluded on the Utthāna-dvādaśī day (12th day of the bright half of Kārttika which generally comes in November). Many rewards, both here and hereafter, have been promised to those that observe this vrata. It is open to women also.</p>
			<p>The saṁnyāsins (monks) also have a cāturmāsya. During the days when the saṁnyāsins were mendicants, realizing the difficulty of moving about during the rainy season, it was made obligatory for them to spend the four or even two months of the rainy season by camping in a suitable place. Their vrata or vow begins on the Vyāsa-pūrṇimā (full-moon day in Āṣāḍha), with a ceremonial worship of God, the sage Vedavyāsa and one&#x2019;s gurus (preceptors). (Hence the day is also called &#x2018;Guru-pūrṇimā&#x2019;.) During these days they can live in the congenial company of other monks, study the scriptures, practise their personal spiritual disciplines and also preach to the householder devotees that may approach them.</p>

			<p>The Hindu society has always consi-dered vivāha or marriage as sacred, as a sacrament. The rites of marriage breathe this spirit. The husband and the wife were expected to observe continence for three nights though sleeping together on the ground, with a daṇḍa or staff between them. This was called &#x2018;trirātravrata&#x2019; (&#x2018;the vow of three nights&#x2019;). The marriage was consummated on the fourth day—hence the name caturthīkarman—after appropriate rites.

			<p>One of the most voluminous and celebrated digests of ancient religious rites and observations is Hemādri&#x2019;s (13th cent. A.D.) Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi. Hemādri who was a minister at the court of the Yādava king of Devagiri (modern Daulatabad in Maharashtra) might have composed this during A.D. 1260-70. According to the state-ments in the book, the author intended to treat the subject in five sections: vrata (religious observances), dāna (gifts), tīrtha (pilgrimage), mokṣa (emancipation) and pariśiṣṭa (supplement). Since the sections dealing with tīrtha and mokṣa are not available now, some scholars feel that Hemādri could not complete his work according to his original intentions. The book is more popular in the Deccan and South India, and is considered as a standard work.</p>

			<p>In Vaiṣṇavite rituals, very often, 24 names of Viṣṇu like Keśava, Nārāyaṇa and Vāsudeva are used. All these names refer to the same deity and give his attributes from different standpoints. Iconographical works have devised a simple method by which these 24 aspects of Viṣṇu can be shown, just by altering the positions of the four well-known appurtenances viz., śaṅkha (conch), cakra (discus), gadā (mace) and padma (lotus). For instance, if they are held—in that order—in the right upper and lower hands, and, left upper and lower hands, the image is that of Vāmana. If, on the other hand, the right upper and lower hands hold the gadā and the śaṅkha, and, the left upper and lower hands hold the cakra and padma, it is the image of Vāsudeva.</p>
			<p>The 24 names are: Keśava, Nārāyaṇa, Mādhava, Govinda, Viṣṇu, Madhusūdana, Trivikrama, Vāmana, Śrīdhara, Hṛṣīkeśa, Padmanābha, Dāmodara, Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Adhokṣaja, Puruṣottama, Nṛsiṁha, Acyuta, Upendra, Janārdana, Hari and Kṛṣṇa.</p>

			<p>According to the Sāṅkhya system of philosophy it is prakṛti or pradhāna comprising the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas, that is the originator of this world. It evolves in stages into 23 fundamental principles—itself being the 24th—by the permutation and combination of which the whole world is created. They are: prakṛti (Mother Nature), mahat (&#x2018;the great&#x2019;, the intellect), ahaṅkāra (egoism), manas (mind), five jñānendriyas (organs of sense), five karmendriyas (organs of action), five tanmātras (subtle elements) and five bhūtas (gross elements).</p>

			<word>Caturvyūhas</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Bhāgavata or the Pāñcarātra religion, which preaches the cult of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa, puts forth the theory that the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu has four aspects of manifestation:</p>
			<ul class="lower-alpha">
				<li>The Para or the supreme;</li>
				<li>the Vyūha or the emanation;</li>
				<li>the Vibhava or the incarnation and</li>
				<li>the Arca or the icon.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Para is the Supreme as He is, in all His glory. Vibhava represents the incarnations. Arca is the descent of the Lord into the icon ceremonially installed and worshipped in the temples.</p>
			<p>The Vyūhas or the emanations are four in number. Hence the term Catur-vyūhas, also called Caturmūrtis. They are: Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. According to Vaiṣṇava mythologies, while Śrī Kṛṣṇa is Vāsudeva, his brother Balarāma is Saṅkarṣaṇa. Pradyumna and Aniruddha are Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s son and grandson respectively. Historically speaking, it is possible that these Yādava heroes were in course of time, apotheosised into these Vyūhas. Symbologically, Vāsudeva represents Citta (mind-stuff), whereas Saṅkarṣaṇa stands for Ahaṅkāra (egoity), Pradyumna for Buddhi (intellect) and Aniruddha for Manas (mind). They represent the cosmic psychological evolution.</p>
			<p>Later on, these Vyūhas were increased to as many as twenty-four. Icono-graphically, all these Vyūhas are identical in appearance except for the arrangement of the four emblems—Śaṅkha, Cakra, Gadā and Padma.</p>
			<p>The Pāñcarātra theology often adds another aspect of the manifestations, viz., the Antaryāmin (the indweller), which obviously, cannot be represented through icons.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The four &#x2018;mānasaputras&#x2019; or mind-born sons of Brahmā, the Creator, are called &#x2018;Catus-sanas&#x2019; since their names begin with the word &#x2018;Sana&#x2019;. They are: Sanaka, Sanatkumāra, Sanatsujāta and Sanandana. They are in the state of eternal boyhood.</p>
			<p>Once they went to Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of Viṣṇu but were denied admittance by the gatekeepers, Jaya and Vijaya. Hence they were cursed by the sages to be born on earth as demons. Jaya and Vijaya, consequently, took birth as Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa, and Siśupāla and Dantavakra.</p>
			<p>The sage Sanatkumāra taught the greatness of Viṣṇu to Vṛtra (the demon enemy of Indra) and spiritual wisdom to Nārada, another great sage. Sanatsujāta taught spiritual truths to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the blind king and father of the Kauravas like Duryodhana. Sanaka is said to be an eternal companion of Lord Viṣṇu. Sanandana is accepted as an ancient teacher of Sāṅkhya, more ancient than even Kapila.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Yoginīs are minor goddesses, aspects of Śakti or Durgā. They are often the gramadevatās or village deities supposed to protect the people of the village when propitiated, or, bring evil and disaster when offended. Their number is variously stated as 8, 60, 64 or even 65.</p>
			<p>The Cauṣaṭ Yoginī Temples are temples of that class where these deities are placed in niches on a circular or rectangular wall with a temple in the centre for the main deity.</p>
			<p>Such temples, most of which were built between the 9th and 12th centuries, are found in Bheraghat near Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Ranipur Jhorial near Patna (Bihar), Dudhati near Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh) and Khajuraho (Madhya Pradesh). The only temple outside Central India is found near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu.</p>

			<word>Cave Temples</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Artificial caves excavated for religious purposes date from the time of Aśoka. Three phases of development of rock-cut architecture are listed by Indologists: the first phase from the 2nd cent. B.C. to the 2nd cent. A.D.; the second phase from the 5th to the 7th cent. A.D.; the third phase from the 7th to the 10th cent. A. D.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>The two caves of Barabar Hill near Gayā in Bihar, dedicated by Aśoka to the Ājīvika monks, the cave at Karli and some Buddhist caves at Ajanta (both in Maharashtra), as also the Jaina caves at Udayagiri and Khaṇḍagiri (Orissa) belong to the first phase. Many caves at Ellora (Maharashtra) come under the second phase. The Hindu and Jaina temples at Ellora, Elephanta and Salsette islands near Mumbai (all in Maharashtra) belong to the third phase.</p>
			<p>Out of about 1200 rock-cut caves discovered (in India), nearly 900 are Buddhist, 200 are Jaina and the rest Hindu. Of the Buddhist caves, those at Ajanta, Ellora, Karli and Nasik (all in Maharashtra) are celebrated. Among the Jaina caves, those at Ellora are note-worthy. The Hindu rock-cut temples at Ellora, Elephanta and Bādāmi (in Karnataka) are equally famous. The Rathas of Mahābalipuram (Tamil Nadu) and the temple of Kailāsanātha at Ellora, though not cave temples, come under the general group of rock-cut temples and are unrivalled.</p>
			<p>The cave temples of the early phase, all Buddhist, generally have caitya halls and a stūpa in them. They are vaulted rectangular halls with an apsidal and containing a stūpa. Among them there are also vihāras or Buddhist monasteries with not only living rooms but also a shrine-cell with an image of the Buddha cut out of the rock in the rear wall.</p>
			<p>The Hindu cave temples generally exhibit the same plan and pattern, and elements of architecture which were well-developed in later years in the regular temples built above the ground.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Nyāyasūtras of Gautama (4th cent. B.C.), the basic text of logical realism and one of the six systems of Hindu philosophical thought, delineates 16 topics out of which nearly half deal with logic. &#x2018;Chala&#x2019; is one of them. Usually translated as &#x2018;quibble,&#x2019; it is one of the devices adopted by an opponent to conquer the exponent, by deliberately misinterpreting his statement. For instance, when the exponent says, &#x2018;The boy is &#x201c;navakambala&#x201d; &#x2019; (possessed of a new blanket), the opponent can, unfairly, object, saying that, &#x2018;The boy is not possessing nine blankets&#x2019; since &#x2018;nava&#x2019; means &#x2018;new&#x2019; as well as &#x2018;nine&#x2019;. This is &#x2018;chala&#x2019;.</p>

			<word>Chandas</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;that which exhilarates&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the names by which the Vedas are called, is &#x2018;chandas,&#x2019; &#x2018;that which exhilarates&#x2019; or &#x2018;that which gives a (protective) covering&#x2019;. More commonly, however, it denotes the metres in poetry. Vedic prosody called &#x2018;Chandas,&#x2019; or &#x2018;Chandaś-śāstra,&#x2019; is considered as one of the six &#x2018;Vedāṅgas&#x2019; or &#x2018;limbs of the Veda&#x2019; (subsidiary disciplines pertaining to the field of Vedic studies), without a study of which, it will be impossible to understand the Vedas proper. Before reciting the Vedic mantras (chants or hymns) it is obligatory to pay one&#x2019;s respect to the ṛṣi (sage through whom the mantra was revealed), the devatā (the deity to whom it is addressed) and the chandas (the metre in which the mantra is composed).</p>
			<p>The earliest of the extant works on Vedic prosody is the Chandas-sūtra by Piṅgala (2nd cent. B.C.) which is in the form of sūtras or aphorisms spread over eight chapters. Eleven major and many more minor metres have been dealt with in this work. Gāyatrī, uṣṇik, anuṣṭup, triṣṭup, jagatī, bṛhatī and paṅkti are the more common ones among them. Usually each metre consists of one to five pādas or &#x2018;feet&#x2019; and each pāda should consist of a specific number of letters. For instance, the famous gāyatrī metre consists of three pādas and eight letters per pāda. The various metres found in classical Sanskrit literature were gradually evolved from the Vedic metres.</p>
			<p>It was believed that the use of certain metres was conducive to the attainment of power or could bring about harm to the enemies.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Out of the six subsidiary works known as &#x2018;Vedāṅgas&#x2019; (&#x2018;limbs of the Vedas&#x2019;) the kalpasūtras deal mainly with sacri-ficial rites. (See <ref>KALPASŪTRAS</ref>.) To fill up the gaps as it were and to expound details not mentioned in these works, but needed for the meticulous performance of the sacrificial rites, some compendiums were composed and they were called &#x2018;pariśiṣṭas&#x2019; (&#x2018;what is left over,&#x2019; appendix). Gobhila-saṅgraha-pariśiṣṭa is one such work related to the Sāmaveda. Based on this work, Kātyāyana (4th to 6th cent. A.D.) wrote a work called Karmapradīpa. This work is known by several other names such as &#x2018;Sāmagṛhya,&#x2019; &#x2018;Chāndogyapariśiṣṭa,&#x2019; &#x2018;Chandogapariśiṣṭa&#x2019; and also, &#x2018;Gobhila-smṛti.&#x2019; It contains about 500 verses.</p>
			<p>This work deals with the topics of wearing the sacred thread, worship of Gaṇeśa and other deities, śrāddha (obsequial rites), consecration of sacred fires, sandhyā ritual, the five daily sacrifices, rules of personal cleanliness and cere-monial purity, duties of a wife and so on.</p>

			<word>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Among the six traditional systems of Hindu philosophy known as Ṣaḍ-darśanas, the Vedānta system, undoubtedly, gets the pride of place. This system, which is very much alive even in the modern times and quite popular, is based entirely on the Upaniṣads, the predominantly philosophical sections of the Vedas. The Chāndogya Upaniṣad is one of the ten Upaniṣads considered to be ancient and authoritative, and on which Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) has written a voluminous commentary. Its importance can be judged from the fact that the work Brahmasūtras has drawn heavily upon it, for topics of discussion.</p>
			<p>Though the word &#x2018;chandas&#x2019; (&#x2018;that which exhilarates&#x2019;) is one of the names of the Vedas in general, it is more particularly applied to the Sāmaveda, the third of the four Vedas wherein the mantras, known as &#x2018;sāmans,&#x2019; are set to music and sung. Those who have specialized in the singing of these sāmans, are called &#x2018;Chandogas&#x2019; and the Brāhmaṇa (liturgical section) pertaining to them is designated as Chāndogya Brāhmaṇa, which itself forms a part of the Tāṇḍya branch of the Sāmaveda. This Brāhmaṇa contains ten prapāṭhakas or sections out of which the first two form the Mantra Brāhmaṇa and the rest, Chāndogya Upaniṣad. It comprises eight chapters and each is subdivided into &#x2018;khaṇḍas&#x2019; or sections (total number of khaṇḍas being 154) and contains 628 kaṇḍikās or mantras, all in prose.</p>
			<h2>First Chapter</h2>
			<p>The speciality of this Upaniṣad is that it describes a number of &#x2018;upāsanās&#x2019; or &#x2018;vidyās&#x2019; or meditations, based generally on Vedic rituals. Since the average spiritual aspirant has devoted the major part of his life to the performance of these rituals, it will be rather difficult for him to take to meditation on God straight away. Hence he is led to it gradually by a series of graded meditations on the rituals, each of the parts being substituted by appropriate symbols that elevate the whole process to spiritual levels. The entire first chapter is devoted to one such meditation, that on the &#x2018;udgītha,&#x2019; the principal part of a sāman chant. Since the udgītha invariably starts with Oṁ and Oṁ is the best symbol of Paramātman, the Supreme Self or God, the Upaniṣad begins with its upāsanā. The second section, with the help of an ancient anecdote, stresses the importance of meditation on the udgītha as identified with the mukhyaprāṇa, the primary life force within the body, which at the cosmic level, has manifested itself as the sun. Meditation on Oṁ in various aspects is continued till the 7th section. The twelfth section gives an amusing incident of dogs singing udgītha (hence called &#x2018;śauva-udgītha,&#x2019; śauva = related to dogs) for obtaining food. Śaṅkara opines that some supernatural deities assuming the forms of dogs revealed this udgītha to the sage Baka-Dālbhya, and it helps a hungry person in securing food.</p>
			<h2>Second Chapter</h2>
			<p>If the first chapter concentrated on prescribing meditation on the different parts or limbs of the sāman, the second chapter is devoted to meditations on the whole sāman. Sections 2 to 10 deal mainly with such meditations. Sections 11 to 21 deal with the meditations on certain special sāmans like the gāyatrasāman, rathantara-sāman, revatīsāman and so on. The twenty-third section, which mentions about the four āśramas or stages of life, deals with the result of meditating purely on Oṁ, which is the attainment of immortality.</p>
			<h2>Third Chapter</h2>
			<p>The first eleven sections of the third chapter deal with the meditation on the Āditya or the sun, who is the personification of the results of all sacrifices, as also the karmas of all beings. The whole series of meditations are called Madhu-vidyā, since Āditya has been compared to &#x2018;madhu&#x2019; or honey. Sections 12 and 13 deal with meditation on Brahman through the gāyatrī since that is the best among the Vedic metres. Meditation on Brahman in the space or ether of the heart, which is identical with the space or ether outside has also been described. The 14th section gives the famous Śāṇḍilyavidyā. It prescribes meditation on the Ātman in the lotus of one&#x2019;s heart, but as identified with Brahman, called here as &#x2018;tajjalān.&#x2019; This leads to the attainment of Brahman, after the fall of the body. Sections 15 and 16 deal with Kośavidyā for the longevity of one&#x2019;s son and Puruṣavidyā for one&#x2019;s own longevity. The sage Mahidāsa Aitareya who discovered the latter vidyā is said to have lived for 116 years.</p>
			<h2>Fourth Chapter</h2>
			<p>The fourth chapter describes four important vidyās: Saṁvargavidyā, Ṣoḍaśa-kalavidyā, Upakosalavidyā and Akṣi-puruṣavidyā. Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa, a king well-known for his generosity, comes to know of the spiritual eminence of the sage Raikva through the accidental hearing of a conversation between two swans flying over his palace. After a thorough search he discovers Raikva resting in the shade under a cart. Honouring him suitably with presents, the king seeks spiritual wisdom from him. Raikva teaches him to meditate upon Vāyu (cosmic wind) outside and the mukhya-prāṇa (chief life-force) inside, as &#x2018;saṁvarga,&#x2019; i.e., one which absorbs and dissolves everything within itself. &#x2018;Saṁvarga&#x2019; is Prajāpati, the Self of all gods. This is the subject-matter of the first three sections. The touching story of the young boy Satyakāma Jābāla and the Ṣoḍaśakalavidyā he received directly from supernatural deities has been described in sections 4 to 9. Meditation on Brahman, the final cause of this world, through meditation on its 16 &#x2018;kalas&#x2019; or parts or aspects, is the subject matter of this particular vidyā. Sections 10 to 14 deal with the story of Upakosala, a disciple of Satyakāma and his obtaining knowledge of Brahman from the three sacred fires in the house of his guru. This has been called Upakosalavidyā. The fires taught that prāṇa or the chief life-force, manifesting in the heart as bliss, is Brahman. The teacher Satyakāma completed their teaching by imparting the knowledge of the &#x2018;akṣipuruṣa,&#x2019; the power behind the senses, the ātman. One who realizes this ātman goes to the abode of Brahman after death and does not return to transmi-gratory existence.</p>
			<h2>Fifth Chapter</h2>
			<p>The fifth chapter puts before us three kinds of destination for a soul after the death of the body:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Those practising Pañcāgnividyā (&#x2018;meditation on the five fires&#x2019;) and similar other upāsanās will go by the &#x2018;arcirādi-mārga&#x2019; or the path of light, to Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahman and will not return to transmigratory worlds.</li>
				<li>Those who perform only rituals without enlightenment will travel by the &#x2018;dhūmādi-mārga,&#x2019; the path of smoke, and attain the worlds like pitṛloka or the world of manes, from which they return to the human world after some time.</li>
				<li>Those who lead a beastly life without practising either upāsanās or ritualistic karmas, will constantly go through the rounds of birth and death.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The first two sections prescribe meditation on the mukhya-prāṇa, the chief life-force, after establishing its superiority over other prāṇas (the sense-organs) through an anecdote. Sections 3 to 10 deal with the famous Pañcāgnividyā (&#x2018;the doctrine of the five fires&#x2019;) and eschatology. Young Śvetaketu, puffed up with the pride of learning, goes to the court of the king Pravāhaṇa Jaivali, with a view to establishing the superiority of his learning but is rebuffed by the king who knew better. He returns crestfallen and angry to his father, the sage Gautama. Gautama approaches the king Pravāhaṇa Jaivali in all humility and requests him to teach the Pañcāgnividyā about which he had questioned Śvetaketu earlier. In this vidyā, heavenly world, rains, earth, man and woman are to be contemplated upon as fire into which oblations of faith, subtle body (of the sacrificer), rain, food and semen are poured, the final oblation being responsible for the rebirth of the sacrificer. Those who know this science go to the world of Brahman after death and will not return here. The rest of the chapter (sections 11 to 24) deals with the Vaiśvānaravidyā. Six sages under the leadership of Uddālaka Āruṇi obtain this vidyā from the king Aśvapati Kaikeya who was an adept in it. Vaiśvānara Ātman is Īśvara or the Cosmic Being, pervading the universe. He is also inside us as the chief life-force, mukhya-prāṇa. Hence the act of eating food should be contemplated upon as Agnihotra sacrifice. One who achieves perfection in this will become identified with the Cosmic Being. This is the gist of this vidyā.</p>
			<h2>Sixth Chapter</h2>
			<p>The last three chapters—6th, 7th and 8th—contain the quintessence of the Vedānta philosophy. The whole of the sixth chapter is devoted to a delineation of the Sadvidyā, knowledge and meditation pertaining to Sat (the eternal Truth) or Brahman. It is in the form of a dialogue between the son Śvetaketu and his father Uddālaka Āruṇi. When Śvetaketu returns home after completing a twelve-year course in Vedic studies, the father Uddālaka Āruṇi notices his conceit born of that learning and questions him whether he has known that by knowing which everything will be known. However, the boy had not known it and so requests his father himself to teach it to him. Citing the examples of clay, gold and iron, and their products (like pot, ornament and nail-cutter) the father first draws the attention of his son to the identity between the cause and its effects, pointing out that names and forms are unreal, the substance alone being real. Applying this principle, he states that before creation, Sat (the eternal Truth) alone existed and that Sat evolved into this world of names and forms through the three primary elements: tejas (fire), ap (water) and anna (earth). All objects of creation including the bodies of living beings, have come out of these elements through permutation and combination. This is the gist of the teachings of the first seven sections. Sections 8 to 10 deal with the merging of the individual self, the jīva, into Sat during the state of deep sleep. However, since ignorance persists, he comes back to his original state. The same logic applies in the case of rebirth after death also. But, those who attain knowledge will get liberated. The famous Vedāntic dictum tat tvam asi, &#x2018;That thou art&#x2019;, appears for the first time in the eighth section and is repeated later, nine times. Sections 12 and 13 teach that Sat, the primary Cause of the universe, is too subtle to be perceived even as the seed of the banyan tree in which the whole tree exists in an involved state. But it pervades the entire creation like the lump of salt dissolved in a jar of water. To know this Sat, the help of a teacher, guru or guide, is necessary. It is like a blindfolded traveller, let off in a forest by robbers, finding his way out with the help of a kind soul. This is the teaching of the 14th section. Though the mode of death is similar to the ignorant as well as the enlightened souls, the latter will not transmigrate whereas the former do. This is explained in the last two sections with the help of an anecdote of the police catching a thief. The purport of the whole chapter seems to be to teach the identity of the jīvātman or the individual self with Brahman, the Cosmic Soul.</p>
			<h2>Seventh Chapter</h2>
			<p>The seventh chapter teaches Bhūma-vidyā, knowledge of the Infinite. Nārada, though himself a great sage and a man of considerable erudition, approaches the distinguished sage Sanatkumāra with a heavy heart seeking peace and joy. Sanatkumāra takes him step by step through meditations on fifteen objects like name, speech, mind and so on, to Bhūman, the Infinite. The Bhūman which is everywhere, which is established in its own glory, by knowing which there is nothing else to be known, is the Self of all beings. One who realizes it, becomes &#x2018;svarāṭ.&#x2019; Like a king, he will have full freedom in all the worlds. To obtain this knowledge, purity of mind got through purity of food and purity of sense-experience, is necessary. It is only a pure mind that can retain and realize spiritual truths.</p>
			<h2>Eighth Chapter</h2>
			<p>It is rather difficult to comprehend and contemplate upon Brahman without qualities, described as Sat and Bhūman. It is easier to meditate upon the saguṇa or qualified aspect of Brahman, as possessing of blessed qualities. The eighth chapter prescribes such a meditation on Brahman in the region of one&#x2019;s heart, as also related disciplines like brahmacarya. The first two sections deal with Dahara-vidyā, meditation on Brahman in the &#x2018;daharākāśa,&#x2019; the little space in the region of the heart. This ākāśa or space in the heart is itself Brahman. It is not limited to that spatial area nor does it get destroyed with the destruction of the body. One who realizes this obtains whatever he wants, in whichever world he contemplates. The next three sections extol and prescribe brahmacarya or celibacy and other related disciplines, for realizing the Ātman-Brahman, who like a dyke is protecting all the worlds. The sixth section describes the various nāḍīs or passages for the flow of prāṇic energy and how the soul of a man of knowledge, at the time of death, enters into suṣumnā nāḍī, departs through the aperture in the top of the head and reaches Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahman, from which there is no return. Sections 7 to 12 deal with the teachings of Prajāpati to Indra and Virocana. Hearing from Prajāpati, the father of creation, that one who realizes the ātman, the Self, who is sinless and beyond all limitations like hunger and thirst, old-age and death, Indra the king of gods and Virocana the king of demons decided to get that knowledge of the ātman. After undergoing brahmacarya (disciplines necessary for spiritual studies) for 32 years, they both approached him for the teaching. When Prajāpati said, that the &#x2018;person seen in the eye&#x2019; is the ātman, Virocana understood it as the reflection seen in the eyeball, which again is the body. Fully satisfied with this understanding that the body is itself the ātman, he returned to his tribe and taught it to them. Indra too took it that way; but very soon he got doubts since the body which is seen in the reflection, is subject to mutilation, disease and death, whereas the ātman is not. He returned and expressed his doubts when Prajāpati instructed him, after a further period of brahmacarya for 32 years, that the &#x2018;person who moves about in the dream is the ātman.&#x2019; When Indra discovered the limitations of this teaching as also of the next that &#x2018;the person in dreamless sleep is the ātman,&#x2019; he was truly instructed (after further periods of brahmacarya totalling in all, 101 years) that the ātman is the &#x2018;seer&#x2019; behind the eyes and all other sense organs, is the witness of all the states and is the immortal spirit different from the mortal body. The last section gives the list of teachers of spiritual wisdom. It also adds that one who leads a life in accordance with dharma and meditates on Brahman in the heart, will reach Brahma-loka after death and will not return.</p>
			<h2>Epilogue</h2>
			<p>Apart from the fact that this Upaniṣad is the second longest and one of the more ancient ones, it throws an interesting light on contemporary history and customs. It mentions many geographical names like Pāñcāla, Kuru, Naimiṣa, Gāndhāra and Kekaya. References to many sciences and arts, villages and towns, buildings and parts of buildings, tools of iron and other implements, different kinds of articles of food and drink, musical instruments, minerals and metals mentioned by name, carts and chariots, keepers of cows and horses, kings and law-enforcing agencies, several calendaric terms—all these indicate a fair degree of civilization. Family life was highly valued and social life was generally peaceful. Truth and righteousness were given the pride of place. For acquiring knowledge from competent teachers no sacrifice was considered too great. The teachers also enforced discipline strictly. Though ritua-listic religion was very much in vogue, philosophical inquiry was considered a superior pursuit.</p>
			<p>Thus, the Chāndogya Upaniṣad is a unique text of the Vedānta system giving an insight into a philosophical inquiry of the highest kind.</p>

			<p>Sometimes, the Hindu mythological lore gives us very interesting stories. The story of Saṁjñā and Chāyā is one such.</p>
			<p>Saṁjñā, the daughter of Tvaṣṭṛ, had been married to Sūrya, the sun-god. Unable to bear the heat and brilliance of her husband, Saṁjñā created her double, Chāyā, and left her in Sūrya&#x2019;s palace and disappeared. Sūrya lived with Chāyā under the impression that she was Saṁjñā herself. Chāyā bore him two sons and a daughter: Sāvarṇi Manu, Śanaiścara (or the planet Śani) and Tapatī (the goddess of the river Tapti, in Madhya Pradesh).</p>

			<word>child-marriage</word>

		<description>
			<p>Child-marriage has often been a subject of criticism against the Hindu society. But child-marriage was not a peculiar phenomenon of the Hindu society alone. It existed even in England during the middle of the 16th century.</p>
			<p>During the times of the Ṛgveda, it was unheard of. Till A.D. 200, marriage of girls just before or after puberty was the rule. Girls could be married even up to or after three years, after puberty. If the parents did not get them married even then, the grown-up girls had the freedom to choose their husbands (vide Manusmṛti 9.89-90).</p>
			<p>However, the situation changed after A. D. 200 and child-marriages became more a rule than an exception. Some scholars opine that the rise of the institution of Buddhist nuns by about this period and the laxity of morals among the nuns forced the Hindu society to adopt child-marriage as a counter measure. The age of girls for marriage was usually 6 to 8 years, an equivalent of the age of the boys for upanayana (the ceremony of investiture with the sacred thread).</p>
			<p>These child-marriages were however mere sacraments of betrothal and the child couple continued to live with their parents. Consummation took place only after puberty.</p>
			<p>During those days, joint family system was very much in vogue. The child couples were received into the big family with love and affection. Hence there were practically no problems of psychological adjustment on either side.</p>
			<p>It cannot of course be denied that things were often taken to ridiculous lengths, resulting sometimes in the cruel problem of child widows.</p>
			<p>It will be of interest to note here that all the rules of the dharmaśāstras regarding child-marriage were only for the brāhmaṇas and did not affect the other sections of the Hindu society.</p>

			<p>The tantras, religio-philosophical texts devoted to the cult of worship of God as the Divine Mother, speak of ten aspects of Śakti (power of God, deified as his female consort) called &#x2018;Daśamahā-vidyās&#x2019;. Out of these ten, &#x2018;Chinnamastā&#x2019; is the sixth in the series.</p>
			<p>She is generally depicted as a goddess holding her own severed head in hand, which drinks the blood gushing out of her own body. She represents the continued state of self-sustenance of the created world in which are seen continuous self-destruction and self-renewal, in a cyclic order.</p>
			<p>The Buddhist tāntrik goddess Vajrayoginī is iconographically similar to Chinnamastā.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The bhakti schools of Vedānta as those propounded by Nimbārka (14th cent. A. D.), Vallabha (A. D. 1473-1531), Caitanya (A. D. 1485-1533) and Śrīkaṇṭha (13th cent. A. D.) have tried to reconcile the existence side by side, of the cit or conscious and the acit or unconscious aspects of creation within the broad framework of advaita or non-dualism. According to these schools, Brahman, the Absolute or God, has two aspects of power: cit-śakti (also cicchakti) or the sentient power and the acit-śakti (also acicchakti) or the insentient power.</p>
			<p>God in his own nature, is absolutely formless pure consciousness. By cicchakti or the sentient power he holds the individual souls within him. By acicchakti or the insentient power he spreads out the material world and connects it with the former for their diverse experiences.</p>
			<p>Cicchakti (sometimes called &#x2018;svarūpa-śākti&#x2019; or &#x2018;antaraṅgaśakti&#x2019;) again, is said to have three aspects—sandhinī, saṁvit and hlādinī—corresponding respectively to the sat, cit and ānanda aspects of God. By sandhinī God upholds his own existence and that of others. By saṁvit he knows and makes others know. By hlādinī, he enjoys and makes others enjoy bliss.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Upaniṣads describe ākāśa (generally translated as space or ether) as the body of Brahman, the Absolute. This ākāśa is also, sometimes, identified with bliss. However, the ākāśa, in these statements should not be confused with the &#x2018;bhūtākāśa,&#x2019; or elemental ākāśa, but must be understood as &#x2018;cidākāśa,&#x2019; or plane of consciousness. Some Śaiva philosophers like Śrīkaṇṭha (13th cent. A. D.) consider it as the ultimate material principle (&#x2018;parāprakṛti&#x2019;), the same as ultimate energy. It is the energy of consciousness, otherwise called cicchakti also. It is the original force of life that manifests itself in the activities of life. All kinds of life functions and all experiences of pleasure are based on the lower or higher level of this cidākāśa.</p>

			<p>Pilgrimage to holy places has become a part of a Hindu&#x2019;s life. Such places are generally associated with avatāra-puruṣas (incarnations of God), ṛṣis (sages) or other holy persons. And, they are mostly situated in places of great natural beauty conducive to spiritual pursuits.</p>
			<p>One of the most famous places of pilgrimage in South India which draws thousands of votaries even from Sri Lanka, is Cidambaram (Chidambaram), called &#x2018;Tillai&#x2019; in Tamil. It is about 230 kms. (150 miles) to the south-west of Madras city and is situated in the south Arcot district of Tamil Nadu. It is one of the &#x2018;pañca-liṅgas&#x2019; (emblems of Śiva representing the five elements) and houses the &#x2018;ākāśaliṅga&#x2019; (&#x2018;emblem of the ether principle&#x2019;). The original icon of the famous Naṭarāja (See <ref>NAṬARĀJA</ref>.), made of gold, is kept in the &#x2018;Kanaka Sabhā&#x2019; (&#x2018;golden hall&#x2019;), one of the five spacious halls in the temple complex. The hall itself gets its name due to the fact of its roof being covered with golden plates. (kanaka = gold).</p>
			<p>Most of the places of Hindu pilgrimage have a &#x2018;sthalapurāṇa,&#x2019; a local legend, explaining the significance of the place and its holy associations. As per the local legend of Cidambaram, this is the place where Śiva defeated Bhadrakālī in a dance contest and blessed his devotees, the sages Patañjali (incarnation of the serpent deity Ādiśeṣa) and Vyāghrapada. Local tradition holds the temple to be about 2000 years old.</p>
			<p>Sprawling over an area of 13 hectares (32 acres), the Naṭarāja temple complex stands on an alluvial plain between two rivers. Built entirely of dressed granite—though no granite has been found within a radius of about 77 kms. (50 miles)—it is surrounded by nine meter (30 ft.) high boundary walls. There are several gopurams or gateways, one facing the east rising in nine tiers, being the most beautiful. It is exquisitely decorated with friezes depicting scenes from Hindu mytho-logy. Two of the gopurams attached to the inner wall of the main temple exhibit 108 poses of dance taught in the nāṭyaśāstra or the science of dance. There are several subsidiary temples in the complex, dedicated to Śivakāmī (Pārvatī, the consort of Śiva), Govindarāja (Viṣṇu), Puṇḍarīkavallī (Lakṣmī) and Gaṇeśa. The icon of Gaṇeśa here is said to be the largest in size, in the whole of India. There is also the main temple tank called &#x2018;Śivagaṅgā&#x2019; measuring 45 m. by 30 m. (150&#x2019; by 100&#x2019;) with steps all round. The thousand pillared hall near this tank is associated with Sekkizhar (11th cent. A. D.) who is said to have composed his monumental work Peria-purāṇam (&#x2018;the Great Mythology&#x2019; containing the biographies of Śaivite saints of Tamil Nadu) here.</p>
			<p>To the right of the icon of Naṭarāja, on the background wall, there is a yantra (geometrical symbol of the deity) adorned with golden necklaces. This is the place of the &#x2018;ākāśaliṅga&#x2019; and is known as &#x2018;cidambara-rahasya,&#x2019; the &#x2018;secret&#x2019; of Cidambaram. It is kept covered by a screen which is pushed aside twice a day for facilitating the devotees to view it.</p>
			<p>Though built in stages by several kings like Kulottuṅga II (A. D. 1135-1150), Sundara Pāṇḍya II (c. 1250), and Kṛṣṇa-devarāya (A.D. 1509-1529), the architectural harmony has been maintained and it is of the Coḷa style. In fact, the deity was the family God of the Coḷa dynasty.</p>
			<p>The biggest festival at the Cidambaram temple is &#x2018;Tiruvādirai&#x2019; which falls during December-January. Since it is a Śiva temple, Mahāśivarātri is of course, celebrated in a grand manner.</p>

			<p>Āyurveda, the science of health and longevity, is an ancient discipline. It purports to treat, not the disease as such, but the patient himself. In the process of making the patient recover his health and enabling him to live long, curative treatment is only one of the steps.</p>
			<p>Out of the &#x2018;aṣṭāṅgas&#x2019; or eight limbs of this science, &#x2018;cikitsā&#x2019; or treatment of the disease, forms the sixth. It has four pādas or quarters: vaidya (the physician), auṣadha (the medicine), paricāraka (the nurse) and rogi (the patient).</p>
			<p>The vaidya should be an adept in this science, not only in theory but also in practice. He should be devoted to his profession and of righteous conduct.</p>
			<p>The auṣadha must be prepared by the vaidya himself after proper examination of the patient and diagnosis, with the right kind of materials.</p>
			<p>The paricāraka must be meticulous, hardworking and sympathetic towards the patient.</p>
			<p>The rogi should obey the commands of the physician and cooperate strictly with the paricāraka.</p>
			<p>If these conditions are fulfilled, treatment will be effective.</p>

			<p>Icons of deities, sages and saints, sculptured as per the rules given in the standard works of iconography, usually have certain hand-poses called &#x2018;hasta&#x2019; or &#x2018;mudrā&#x2019;, indicating certain specific ideas or sentiments. One such pose, the &#x2018;cinmudrā,&#x2019; is sculptured on images in the posture of imparting knowledge. For instance: Dakṣiṇāmūrti aspect of Śiva and Ādiśaṅkara. In this pose the tips of the thumb and the forefinger, usually of the right hand, are joined to form a circle while the other fingers are kept open and stretched. The whole palm faces outwards.</p>

			<p>According to the philosophy of Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137), known as Viśiṣṭādvaita (qualified monism), Brahman, Īśvara or God possesses in himself two modes or aspects—the &#x2018;cit&#x2019; or the sentient part and the &#x2018;acit&#x2019; or the insentient part—using which he brings about creation. The innumerable jīvas or individual souls endowed with consciousness constitute the &#x2018;cit&#x2019; whereas &#x2018;prakṛti&#x2019; or insentient nature constitutes &#x2018;acit&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;cit&#x2019; is also used in other systems of Indian philosophy to indicate the soul and consciousness.</p>

			<p>The Yoga system of philosophy, as systematized by Patañjali (200 B. C.) posits three fundamental principles: puruṣa or the individual soul, prakṛti or insentient nature and Īśvara or God. Among these, puruṣa is also called by other names such as draṣṭā (the seer), citi (consciousness) and citiśakti (conscious power). His essential nature is pure consciousness; hence the name.</p>

		<description>
			<p>All the deeds of human beings, whether good or bad, are supposed to be recorded by Citragupta, the scribe of Yama, the god of death. According to one version, he was originally a king of the Sūryavaṁśa (descended from the Sun) who had attained omniscience through the worship of Sūrya. He was hence taken away by Yama and appointed as a scribe in his world. As per another version, he emanated out of the body of Brahmā when he was in deep meditation. Brahmā himself taught him the knowledge of the hidden and subtle things. He was later on chosen to be the scribe of Yama. He is regarded as the progenitor of the caste &#x2018;kāyastha&#x2019; and had nine sons. The names of these sons (eg., Bhaṭṭa, Nāgara, Ambaṣṭha etc.) are also caste names and hence considered as the progenitors of those castes.</p>
			<p>Contrary to common conception, Citragupta is a single person and not two.</p>
			<p>Iconographical works depict him as red in colour and place his image to the right of Yama. He is invariably shown with a stylus and a palm leaf in his hands, the paraphernalia of a scribe.</p>
			<p>Citragupta is worshipped, especially by the kāyasthas (a particular caste), on Yamadvitīyā day (second day of bright half of the month Kārttika, usually in November). On this day sisters invite their brothers for a feast and offer presents.</p>

			<p>Citrakūṭa is one of the holy places associated with Śrī Rāma and an important pilgrimage centre. It is situated in the Banda district of Uttar Pradesh, about 140 kms. (87 miles) from the city of Allahabad.</p>
			<p>According to the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, after being banished from Ayodhyā, Śrī Rāma, Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa came here and lived for a few days. It was here that Bharata (the brother for whose sake Śrī Rāma had to give up the kingdom) met him to persuade him to go back to Ayodhyā; and failing in the mission, returned with the pādukās (wooden sandals) of Śrī Rāma.</p>
			<p>The poet-saint Tulsīdās (16th cent. A.D.) is said to have had a vision of Śri Rāma here.</p>
			<p>Citrakūṭa and the village Sītāpur are situated on the left bank of the river Mandākinī, also called Payoṣṇī or Payasvinī. It is a very picturesque place with the Kāmadgiri hill and a forest associated with it. It is customary for the pilgrims to go round the hill. This is called &#x2018;parikrama&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Other notable places are: Rāmghāṭ and Jānakīghaṭ (where Śrī Rāma and Sītā used to bathe); Sphaṭikaśilā (where Śrī Rāma is said to have slept on the lap of Sītā when the demon Kākāsura hurt her); Bharatakūpa (the well into which Bharata poured all the sacred waters collected for Śrī Rāma&#x2019;s coronation, but which could not be used); Gupta-godāvarī (a stream inside a cave); Atri Āśrama, also called Anasūyāji, the hermitage of the sage couple, Atri and Anasūyā.</p>
			<p>Huge crowds gather here on Śrīrāmanavamī (birthday of Śrī Rāma, usually in April) and Dīpāvalī or Diwali (usually in November) days.</p>
			<p>Other holy places in the vicinity of Citrakūṭa are the hermitages of Vālmīki, Śarabhaṅga and Sutīkṣṇa.</p>

She bore him an equally heroic son, named Babhruvāhana. When Arjuna was on a conquering expedition, following the horse of the Aśvamedha sacrifice, he was challenged and killed by Babhruvāhana who did not know him as his father, since Babhruvāhana had lived away from him even from childhood days and had no occasion to meet him. Citrāṅgadā however, revived Arjuna to life with the help of Ulūpī, another wife of Arjuna, belonging to the tribe of the Nāgas.</p>

If the day happens to be a Thursday, Saturday or Sunday, it is considered even more auspicious. Special worship is offered to Citragupta on this day. In Tamil Nadu, people believe that a bath in the river Citrā rising on the Kuṭṭalam hills in the Tirunelvelly district, on this day, is meritorious since the river took its birth on this day.

			<p>Post-Śaṅkara literature on Advaita Vedānta has grown enormously, both in quantity and in quality as also subtlety. Citsukha is one of the well-known writers of this period, on Advaita Vedānta. He lived in the early part of the thirteenth century. He was a pupil of Gauḍeśvarā-cārya, also known as Jñānottama. His works are: Bhāṣya-bhāva-prakāśikā (a commentary on the Brahmasūtrabhāṣya of Śaṅkara); Abhiprāya-prakāśikā (commentary on the Brahmasiddhi of Maṇḍana); commentaries on the Naiṣkarmyasiddhi of Sureśvara, Nyāyamakaranda of Ānanda-bodha and Khaṇḍana-khaṇḍa-khādya of Śrīharṣa.</p>
			<p>However his most important work is Tattvapradīpikā, commonly known as Citsukhī. It is a unique work for two reasons:</p>

The second chapter analyzes the various concepts and categories of the Nyāya and the Vaiśeṣika systems like guṇa (quality), karma (action), sāmānya (generality), samavāya (inherence) and so on, and refutes them. The third chapter deals with the possibility of realization of Brahman and the nature of mukti (liberation) through jñāna (know-ledge). The last chapter deals with the nature of the ultimate state of liberation.</p>

			<p>&#x2018;Citta&#x2019; is one of the general names given to the mind in the Indian philosophical systems. The word &#x2018;manas&#x2019; is of course more common. However, since the Yoga system of Patañjali has adopted this word and treats of it in a technical and exhaustive manner, we will mainly confine ourselves here to the treatment given in that system. As regards the concept of mind in other systems of Indian philosophy, see <ref>MIND</ref>.</p>
			<p>Patañjali (200 B.C.) considers &#x2018;citta&#x2019; or mindstuff as a physical material made up of the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas, but with a preponderance of sattva. (See <ref>GUṆAS, RAJAS, SATTVA</ref> and <ref>TAMAS</ref>.) It is capable of reflecting the power of pure consciousness of the puruṣa or the individual soul. It is also capable of modifications. It is the modified citta with the pure consciousness reflected in it that is responsible for cognition, thinking, doubts or drawing definite conclusions. Hence it is also called by such names as antaḥkaraṇa (the internal organ), manas (the mind) and buddhi (the intellect). The modifications themselves are called &#x2018;cittavṛttis&#x2019;. When these cittavṛttis are suppressed (&#x2018;niruddha&#x2019;) then, &#x2018;yoga&#x2019; results; that is, the puruṣa or the soul gets detached from the citta and is re-established in his own glory. &#x2018;Yoga&#x2019; (union) is thus actually, &#x2018;viyoga&#x2019; (separation) from the mindstuff.</p>
			<p>The citta works at five levels, called &#x2018;cittabhūmis.&#x2019; They are: kṣipta (restlessness), mūḍha (torpidity), vikṣipta (distraction), ekāgra (onepointedness) and niruddha (suppressed or without modifications). Of course, it is only in the last two levels that yoga is possible.</p>
			<p>Patañjali also postulates two &#x2018;citta-dharmas&#x2019; or characteristics, for the citta. They are paridṛṣṭa (the seen) and aparidṛṣṭa (the unseen). Means of know-ledge like direct perception which rouse cittavṛttis and are hence discernible, belong to the former. &#x2018;Saṁskāras&#x2019; or innate tendencies, &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; or effects of previous actions inherent in the mind, ultimately resulting in happy and unhappy experiences and a few other such qualities belong to the second.</p>
			<p>Patañjali also deals with some obstacles to yoga, called &#x2018;antarāyas&#x2019; which cause &#x2018;cittavikṣepa&#x2019; or distraction of mind. Vyādhi (disease), styāna (mental laziness), saṁśaya (doubt), ālasya (physical laziness), etc., are some of these obstacles.</p>
			<p>To overcome these and get &#x2018;citta-prasādana&#x2019; or peace of mind, he recommends several steps like cultivating an attitude of friendship towards the happy people and compassion towards those in difficulties.</p>
			<p>While dealing with the psychic powers, Patañjali mentions &#x2018;cittasaṁvit&#x2019; or full knowledge about the mind by meditating on one&#x2019;s heart and attaining samādhi (perfect concentration) there.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Untouchability (aspṛśyatā) has been an ugly blot on the Hindu society. As if to deliver a blow to such narrow concepts and practices, many great saints have been born among these untouchables. They had to be accepted and honoured by the elitist groups and castes by the sheer power of their spiritual glory.</p>
			<p>One such great saint was Cokhāmeḷā. He lived in the thirteenth century in the holy city of Paṇḍharāpura (in Maha-rashtra). It was his wont to have a dip in the Bhīmā river early in the morning, circumambulate the temple of Pāṇḍuraṅga (also called Viṭṭhala, an aspect of Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa) from outside, bow down to the deity from the main gate and sing songs in his praise, mostly composed by himself. The proud and prejudiced priests tried their best to humiliate him and even harm him; but were humbled in the end since the Lord was on his side. They were obliged to accept his greatness and honour him.</p>
			<p>As in the lives of many other saints, miracles are said to have happened in his life also. He died when the wall he was building, along with other workmen, collapsed. His samādhi (grave) is still to be seen at Paṇḍharāpura, opposite to that of Nāmdev, another great saint who was his contemporary. He has left some nice abhaṅgas (devotional songs in Marāṭhi language) in which he describes his travails due to social prejudices and the acts of grace by God.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;conversion&#x2019; derived from the Latin root conversio, means a change of direction, complete reorientation of one&#x2019;s personality, towards God. It is a purely spiritual process of turning away from the mammon and towards God. It has nothing to do with proselytism. Identification with it is a later development.</p>
			<p>Whether Hinduism has practised proselytization over the centuries or not, is a moot point. Perhaps not, at least in the aggressive sense. But there is enough evidence in the Hindu religious works indicating a quiet absorption into its folds, of aliens like the &#x2018;yavanas&#x2019; and &#x2018;mlecchas,&#x2019; considered to be barbaric or less civilized, whenever they have willingly adopted the Hindu ways of life. This process has gone on for almost two thousand years, often unnoticed.</p>
			<p>But the problem which has often caused unrest in the Hindu society is that of conversion of the Hindus into the Semitic religions. While it has been accepted that socio-economic factors have been largely responsible for this, and efforts have been put in, to rectify the imbalances, the mind of the Hindu reli-gious leaders has also been exercised over their reconversion.</p>
			<p>A study of the Hindu religious works, whether of the ancient Brāhmaṇas or of the later dharmaśāstras, shows that reconversion was not an unknown pheno-menon. The sacrificial ceremonies called &#x2018;vrātya-stomas&#x2019; were aimed at purifying and bringing back the &#x2018;vrātyas&#x2019; (renegades as well as foreigners) into the Āryan fold. The Viṣṇu-dharmottara-purāṇa (A.D. 500) and the Devalasmṛti (A.D. 1000?) give specific instructions for purifying and bringing back into the Hindu fold, those who had been forcibly converted by the &#x2018;mlecchas&#x2019; (races like the śakas, yavanas and pahlavas). During the recent past Maharṣi Dayānanda Sarasvatī (A.D. 1824-1883) started the &#x2018;śuddhi&#x2019; movement which became quite vigorous for some time.</p>
			<p>Efforts at reconversion—often called &#x2018;parāvartana&#x2019; or the return to the original fold—still continue. Standardization of the procedure has also been attempted at. However, the real stumbling block in the process has been the rehabilitation of the reconverted people, into the caste-conscious Hindu society.</p>

			<p>This world in which we live, move, and have our being as it were, has been spurring the imagination of philosophers for millennia, about its origin and evolution. It will be an interesting, nay, even fascinating, experience to go through the various accounts of creation given in the Hindu scriptures and philosophical works.</p>
			<p>The Ṛgveda had dealt with this subject in a few hymns but there is no attempt at giving a cogent theory and well-reasoned philosophy. Before sṛṣṭi or creation, Deva or God alone existed. He is our father. He desired to create. He manifested this world out of himself and entered into it (vide Ṛgveda 10.81.1; 10.5.7). The famous Puruṣasūkta (Ṛgveda 10.90) describes the whole creation as having come out of the Puruṣa or primeval Being, using the allegory of a sacrifice.</p>
			<p>Allied Vedic works like the Brāhmaṇas hold similar views. The Taitti-rīya Brāhmaṇa by implication declares (2.8.9.7) that the Deva is both the material and the efficient cause of this universe. The words &#x2018;Viśvakarmā&#x2019; (one, whose work this world is), &#x2018;Hiraṇyagarbha&#x2019; (golden egg) and &#x2018;Prajāpati&#x2019; (lord of beings) have also been used in this work to denote the Creator.</p>
			<p>In some of the Vedic accounts of creation, primeval waters form the first product from which subsequent creation takes place. We thus see two streams of thought here: one advocating evolution of the world from God and the other, creation by God. Accounts of creation usually contain accounts of sustenance and dissolution (sthiti and pralaya) also.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣads which contain more specific references to creation, generally follow the Vedic thought pattern. Before creation, Brahman, also called Ātman or Sat, alone existed. It desired to become many and created tejas or fire, ap or water and anna or earth. They are the three fundamental elements from which the whole creation came out (vide Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.2). Some other Upaniṣads trace the evolution of the world from the Ātman through the pañcabhūtas or five fundamental elements (vide Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.1; 2.6) and others like the Praśna (1.4), through the creation of matter and spirit (rayi and prāṇa). There are also accounts according to which the individual souls have sprung from Brahman like sparks from the fire (Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 2.1.1). The idea that Brahman, having created the world, has entered into it and controls it from within, is also advocated (Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.6).</p>
			<p>The epics and the purāṇas give their own, variegated, accounts of creation. In one pattern of descriptions, Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa brings forth Brahmā (the four-faced creator) who subsequently creates the various worlds (numbering 3 or 7 or even 14) and their denizens out of himself. In another set of descriptions, Nārāyaṇa creates a golden egg (Hiraṇyagarbha) which starts floating on the primeval waters. He himself animates it, breaks it into two, forming the earth and heaven. The Puruṣa or Prajāpati that comes out of it then creates all beings. The Creator dividing himself into two, the male and the female principles, and their union giving rise to the whole creation is also found in some descriptions. In fact this theory is based on similar descriptions found in Upaniṣads like the Bṛhadā-raṇyaka (1.4.2-4).</p>
			<p>The Ṣaḍ-darśanas or the six philosophical systems, also discuss this question and give their own theories. The Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika schools state that Īśvara or God creates the world out of the eternal substances like atoms, space, time, ether, mind and souls. He is also responsible for the sustenance and dissolution of the world. The Sāṅkhya and the Yoga systems posit the theory that prakṛti or primeval nature (consisting of the three guṇas of sattva, rajas and tamas) evolves by stages into this world due to the will of Īśvara (God) and the presence of the puruṣas or individual souls. This theory is echoed in some of the purāṇas also. The Pūrva-mīmāṁsā system considers the world and souls to be eternally there—neither created nor destroyed—but regulated by karma (unseen effects of actions done).</p>
			<p>The Vedānta system just organizes the philosophy of the Upaniṣads. The Advaita Vedānta of Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) considers the world as an illusory appearance in Brahman, the real substratum. Though the general theory of creation given in the Upaniṣads is accepted, it is given only an empirical status. The theistic schools of Vedānta, of Rāmānuja (A.D. 1017-1137) and of Madhva (A.D. 1197-1276) on the other hand, accept the reality of creation and the created world.</p>
			<p>It is thus seen that there are so many varieties and types of description of the creation process that it is difficult to put forward any definite theories. However, the thought pattern revealed in the Ṛgveda and developed in the Upaniṣads may be treated as more authentic and more universally accepted than others. Summarized briefly, it states that God the Absolute, creates the world out of himself, out of his own will, sustains it and rules over it, and dissolves it at the end of a cycle. This cycle of creation, sustenance and dissolution goes on eternally.</p>
			<p>The whole purpose of creation is to give the jīvas or the individual souls in bondage, one more chance for redemption and liberation from transmigration. This being the main theme of Hindu philosophy and religion, it has not paid much attention to the details of the process of creation.</p>

			<note />

		<description>
			<p>Belief in the sanctity of the cow has been a basic tenet in Hinduism since the ancient days. Though sacrifice of a cow or a bull and eating its flesh were present in the remote past, even by the time of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa its sacredness had been recognized and eating its flesh prohibited. The Ṛgveda calls the cow &#x2018;aghnyā&#x2019; (&#x2018;not fit to be killed&#x2019;) and praises it highly (vide 4.1.6; 8.69.2). The fact that the bull and the cow were the very centre of the agricultural society of the Vedic Āryans and that milk and milk-products were used in sacrificial rites, must have been largely responsible for this prohibition.</p>
			<p>The epics and the purāṇas have showered high encomiums on the cow and gifting it (&#x2018;godāna&#x2019;). Cows on earth have been described as the &#x2018;daughters&#x2019; of the celestial cow &#x2018;Surabhi&#x2019; or &#x2018;Kāmadhenu&#x2019;. All the gods are said to reside in its various limbs. The cow is considered to be so pure that in certain religious rites, the performer has to live and sleep in the cow-pen for a specified period. &#x2018;Pañcagavya&#x2019; (a mixture of the five products of a cow, viz., milk, curds, ghee, dung and urine) is considered holy and is consumed during certain religious rites, especially of an expiatory nature.</p>
			<p>The earth has often been compared to a cow. In the mythological works, whenever any serious trouble arises on earth, she is said to assume the form of a cow and approach its saviour, either God or a great king. Pṛthu, an incarnation of Viṣṇu and a great king, is said to have &#x2018;milked&#x2019; the &#x2018;cow&#x2019; of this earth and obtained from it, corn, vegetables and other items of food. (Hence the name &#x2018;pṛthvī&#x2019;—daughter of Pṛthu—for the earth.)</p>
			<p>As part of the funeral rites, a cow is gifted away or let off. It is called &#x2018;anustaraṇī&#x2019; (&#x2018;that which helps in crossing&#x2019;). It is believed to help the dead person cross the fetid river Vaitaraṇī, flowing between the human world and that of Yama, the god of death.</p>
			<p>Association of Lord Kṛṣṇa with the cows is well-known to all students of Hindu religious literature. This has further enhanced their sanctity, especially in the minds of the masses.</p>
			<p>The Brahmavaivartapurāṇa describes in great detail, the &#x2018;Goloka&#x2019; (cow-heaven), the abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa, far above the Brahmaloka (the abode of Brahmā) itself.</p>

			<word>cremation</word>
			<note />

		<description>
			<p>History reveals that the disposal of the bodies of the dead has been practised by mankind in several ways: cremation, burial, consigning it to water, leaving it on mountain tops or tree tops to be devoured by animals and vultures, and embalming. Out of these the first two have been most widely practised.</p>
			<p>In India, cremation of dead bodies has been existing since very ancient days. Bodies of dvijas (&#x2018;twice-born&#x2019;) (See <ref>DVIJA</ref>.) who had kept duly consecrated Vedic fires (such people were called &#x2018;āhitāgnis&#x2019;) were invariably cremated with the Vedic fires, the various wooden sacrificial vessels and implements being placed on the various limbs of the dead body, at the time of cremation. Those who had not kept the Vedic fires were cremated with ordinary fire. The practice of dismembering a she-goat or a cow, technically called &#x2018;anustaraṇī&#x2019; and keeping its various severed parts on the dead body at the time of cremation was also there, but was given up in later times. (The animal was let off or gifted away.) The whole process of cremation was an elaborate ritual.</p>
			<p>Dead bodies could be carried on the shoulders by the male relatives or could be transported by a cart. According to one account, a great deal of noise is to be made by means of instruments like the cymbols, while carrying the dead body to the crematorium. Though weeping was allowed during the time of cremation, it was prohibited after the cremation was over.</p>
			<p>During a period when transport and communication were difficult, people who would go out travelling either for pilgrimage or for business or for any other purpose, had to face many hardships. So, when someone who went out, was heard to have died (and the body could not be recovered), cremation used to be done to an effigy prepared out of palāśa (Butea frondosa) leaves, flour of barley and woollen thread. This was called &#x2018;ākṛti-dahana&#x2019; (&#x2018;burning the effigy&#x2019;). Such cremation of an effigy was done to people who were not heard of for twelve years or more also. If by chance they returned later, they had to undergo all the sacraments like jātakarma, nāmakaraṇa etc.</p>
			<p>The ashes and bones were collected after cremation—this was called &#x2018;asthi-sañcayana&#x2019;—and used to be either interred in a suitable place or consigned to a sacred river or sea.</p>

			<word>crime and punishment</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The problem of crime and the system of punishment have existed right from the days human beings began to live in organized societies. The contribution of Hindu jurisprudence in this regard, through its great saints like Gautama, Āpastamba, Baudhāyana and Manu—all of whom lived centuries before the Christian era—and a galaxy of other writers right up to A.D. 1000 or more, is consider-able, both in quantity and quality.</p>
			<p>One peculiar feature of this problem in India has been that social life and religious life being inextricably mixed up, it often becomes difficult to distinguish a crime from a sin or vice versa. Crimes should be punished but sins are to be expiated. All crimes are sins, but all sins are not crimes. Stealing is both a crime and a sin whereas neglect of his duties by a Vedic student is a sin but not a crime. A sin becomes a crime if it has social repercussions and impinges on the solidarity of the social system.</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras (lawbooks guiding various aspects of socio-religious life of the Hindus) recognize the equality before law. None who committed a crime was exempt from punishment. Though details of punishments for various crimes have been meticulously worked out, the primary object was to protect the people of the society from the criminals and deter the potential criminals from committing such crimes.</p>
			<p>Trials used to be conducted directly by the king himself or by the judges duly appointed by him. These judges had to be brāhmaṇas of unimpeachable character. However, though the judges could pronounce the sentence, it was for the king to execute the same.</p>
			<p>The effect of the varṇa-cum-caste system on punishments meted out for the same crime is clearly discernible in these writings. However, two diametrically opposite schools are met with. If some award more severe punishments to the members of the higher castes, since they ought to know better, others give less. The argument in the latter case is that being culturally more refined, they are psychologically more sensitive, and even lesser punishment will have the desired effect. After all, does not punishment entail a social stigma too? Even then, punishment awarded to the śūdras for listening to the Vedas or trying to learn them—which was considered to be a great offence—was extremely severe.</p>
			<p>Whenever a criminal was punished, especially in the case of the higher caste groups, the offender was also to expiate himself through appropriate rites and discipline. This would render him fit for social intercourse later. If this was not done, more severe punishments would follow.</p>
			<p>Cognizable offences listed in these lawbooks are legion: defamation, stealing, robbery, usurpation, sexual crimes of various types and degrees, treachery, physical assaults, murder, criminal abortion, offences against the State through espionage and sabotage, and so on.</p>
			<p>Punishments were generally classified into four groups: vāgdaṇḍa (censure), dhigdaṇḍa (severe rebuke), dhanadaṇḍa (fines) and vadhadaṇḍa (corporal punishment). They could be awarded separately or jointly. The first two were for light offences only. Fines could be light or heavy, confiscation of property being the last word. However, even in such cases, the main tools and implements of workers, artisans, warriors, musicians etc., were not touched. The king was prohibited from appropriating the confiscated property to himself. Corporal punishment varied from simple flogging up to dismemberment of limbs or death. Punishments to women and old people or weaklings, were of lesser intensity. But, even brāhmaṇas and women were put to death if found guilty of heinous crimes. Offences of children below specified ages were not recognized. The sins of their wrongdoings were declared to go to their parents. Repeaters of crimes would invite more and more severe punishments. Public disgrace through branding and shaving, or parading in the public streets was also resorted to, for certain crimes.</p>
			<p>Viewing an offence as venial or mortal, varied from writer to writer or even according to times. Chronologically speaking, earlier lawgivers were more severe whereas the later ones were more lenient.</p>

			<p>Also called &#x2018;caula,&#x2019; this is the eighth of the ṣoḍaśa-saṁskāras (sixteen sacraments) which every Hindu of the first three castes was to undergo. It is actually the first tonsure of the child and hence a religious act. It should be done after the child completes one year, but before three years. The age-limit was gradually raised to seven years. In the modern days it is often done just before the upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread) ceremony.</p>
			<p>This rite is to be performed on an auspicious day, when the moon is in conjunction with the constellation Punarvasu, but avoiding the ninth day of the lunar month. The principal act of this rite is the cutting of the hair of the child by its father to the chanting of appropriate Vedic mantras. (The barber will of course do the rest.) Performance of homa (offerings in duly consecrated fire), feeding the brāhmaṇas and receiving their blessings are the other items of the rite. The hair that is cut off should be disposed off in such a way that none will have any access to it (for e.g., burying it in the cowpen, consigning it into a pond etc.).</p>
			<p>The number and position of the śikhās (tufts of hair) varied according to the family traditions. It was generally kept at the eddy of hairs on the top of the head. Works on Āyurveda (the science of life and longevity) state that the śikhā protects the vital artery on the head and is conducive to long life.</p>
			<p>This rite could be performed for girls also but without the Vedic mantras. Even in the modern days, the practice of removing the first hair of the girl-child exists.</p>

The process of aging set her thinking about what is really permanent and unchanging in life. Through her own struggles she was able to attain spiritual enlightenment and succeeded also in teaching the same to her husband. The story is dealt with in detail in the Yogavāsiṣṭha, a version of Rāmāyaṇa, intended to teach extreme form of Advaita Vedānta.</p>

When Pulomā was threatened by a demon and was hence struck with fear, the baby dropped down. But the baby reduced the demon to ashes just by staring at him!</p>
			<p>Once, when Cyavana was sitting in meditation for many years at a stretch and an anthill had grown over him, Sukanyā, the young daughter of the king Śaryāti, happened to come there. Out of curiosity she pierced the holes in the anthill from which a strange light was emanating. This struck the sage blind. As an expiation, the king had to give Sukanyā in marriage to the sage and she had to serve him. She however gladly accepted her fate and sincerely served her husband. Due to her power of chastity she was able to win the grace of Aśvins (twin deities, who are physicians of gods) who restored the youth of the sage Cyavana. He, out of gratitude, got them the right of sharing sacrificial offerings along with Indra and other gods.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Derived from the root &#x2018;dhā&#x2019; (to support, to sustain) the word &#x2018;dadhi&#x2019; represents curds (curdled milk or yoghurt), since, perhaps, it is considered to be a better food item than milk in sustaining the health of the body.</p>
			<p>It has important uses in Vedic sacrifices. It is used to curdle fresh, hot, milk which is used as oblation and also consumed by the sacrificer in the Darśa sacrifice. So also in the Āgrayaṇa rite. In the animal sacrifice (Paśubandha) it is utilised to prepare pṛṣadājya (a mixture of curds and ghee) used for sprinkling over the immolated animal. It is expected to be consumed by the sacrificer in the dīkṣā rite (consecration of the sacrificer in a Soma sacrifice).</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Dadhigraha&#x2019; refers to the drawing of curds offered to Prajāpati just before the morning pressing of the soma juice.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Dadhigharma&#x2019; is a beverage of hot milk and curdled milk poured into a warm pot by the adhvaryu priest and used as a libation at the midday pressing of the soma juice in a Somayāga. &#x2018;Dadhimantha&#x2019; is a beverage of grains (saktu) mixed with curds, also used in sacrifices.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Dadhīci (also spelt as &#x2018;Dadhīca&#x2019;) was a great sage who willingly sacrificed his life to help the gods conquer their eternal foes, the asuras.</p>
			<p>Once the gods deposited their various weapons with the sage Dadhīci for safe custody. But they did not return in the stipulated time. Since the weapons were getting rusted and were crumbling, the sage dissolved them in water and drank the same. They got merged in his backbone making it immensely strong. When the gods, under the leadership of their king Indra came back and asked for the return of their weapons, Dadhīci told them what he had done. Since they requested for his backbone, out of which a great weapon could be made and with which their formidable foe, Vṛtrāsura, could be killed, he immediately obliged them by giving up his body in yoga. Indra&#x2019;s Vajrāyudha (thunderbolt) was prepared out of it.</p>
			<p>Dadhīci stands for the highest ideal of self-sacrifice for social good.</p>
			<p>He was the son of Atharvaṇa and Śānti. The well-known sage Pippalāda of Upaniṣadic fame was his son.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The political and social turmoil in medieval India was also responsible—though in a strange and inscrutable way—to throw up many a great saint who tried by their lives and teachings, to show that the true spirit of religion lies in inner mystical experience and not in dry rituals or meaningless formalities.</p>
			<p>Dādū (A. D. 1544-1603) was one of the brighter stars of this period and the most famous of the followers of Kabīr&#x2019;s (A. D. 1440-1518) ideals. Born in Ahmedabad (in Gujarat) he seems to have spent most of his time in Rajasthan. He passed away in the village Narāṇā (or Nārāyaṇa) of Rajasthan, where his followers—known as &#x2018;Dādūpanthis&#x2019;—have their chief centre even now.</p>
			<p>He established the &#x2018;Brahma or Parabrahma Sampradāya&#x2019; with a view to uniting all the divergent faiths in one bond of love and friendship.</p>
			<p>He did not believe in the authority of the scriptures but in the value of realisation. He laid great stress on the cultivation of virtues like humility, compassion, fearlessness, forgiveness and firmness in one&#x2019;s path.</p>
			<p>He was a householder and believed that the natural life of the householder was best suited for spiritual realisation.</p>
			<p>His children too (two sons and two daughters) were persons of high spiritual calibre.</p>
			<p>At his request, his disciples made (in A. D. 1600) a collection of the devotional writings of all the different sects. This anthology, containing the sayings of many Muslim saints also, helped the spiritual aspirants of all types in their journey towards perfection.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Right from the Vedic days Hindus have been rather fastidious in choosing &#x2018;good&#x2019; days and avoiding &#x2018;bad&#x2019; days for the starting of any venture. Even now, even the average Hindu, is very particular about this.</p>
			<p>Such days are generally decided with the help of astrologers and priests who consult the pañcāṅga (the almanac) and give their opinion. One of the inauspicious days mentioned there, is called &#x2018;dagdha-yoga&#x2019;. If the week days from Sunday to Saturday occur on certain tithis (days as per the lunar calendar) as shown below, they are called &#x2018;dagdhayogas&#x2019;. The name is perhaps derived from the reason that ventures started on such days of the week, united (yoga = union) with certain tithis, become dagdha or destroyed (dagdha = burnt, destroyed).</p>
			<p>They are:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Sunday</td>
					<td>associated with	dvādaśī (12th day)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Monday</td>
					<td>associated with	ekādaśī (11th day)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Tuesday</td>
					<td>associated with	daśamī (10th day)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Wednesday</td>
					<td>associated with	tṛtīyā (3rd day)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Thursday</td>
					<td>associated with	ṣaṣṭhī (6th day)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Friday</td>
					<td>associated with	dvitīyā (2nd day)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Saturday</td>
					<td>associated with	saptamī (7th day)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The days (or tithis) given in the last column are calculated either from the day after the new-moon or the full-moon.</p>
			<p>These dagdhayoga days are inauspicious.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Hindu mythological lore is replete with the stories of constant wars and conflicts between the suras and the asuras, the devas and the dānavas.</p>
			<p>The sage Kaśyapa has been projected by these stories as the progenitor of all living beings. He had thirteen wives, all of whom were daughters of Dakṣa-prajāpati. Among these, Aditi, Diti and Danu were more well-known.</p>
			<p>The sons of Aditi are ādityas or āditeyas (same as devas or suras or gods), of Diti, the daityas and of Danu, the dānavas. Sometimes the asuras, the daityas and the dānavas (as also the rākṣasas) are bracketed together. They seem to be the archetypes of violent, greedy and sinful beings. However, even from among them great persons like Prahlāda, Bali and Bāṇa had been born and their lives as men of virtue and devotees of God had been exemplary.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Throughout the history of mankind, some kind of belief in destiny, in the unseen hand of fate, seems to have existed. The Hindus have been no exception to this phenomenon.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;daiva&#x2019; has been derived from &#x2018;deva&#x2019;, a god or a superior being or a supernatural power. In effect, it means the unseen power of fate (adṛṣṭa).</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras and the purāṇas have discussed in detail, the question whether daiva is more powerful or puruṣakāra (human effort). Three different views have emerged:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Daiva is all-powerful;</li>
				<li>Human effort is superior;</li>
				<li>Both have an equal place in our life.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Since daiva (fate or luck) is generally interpreted as the cumulative effect of our past karmas tending to give a particular direction in this life, the third view seems to be more reasonable.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Śiva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity, is always worshipped as a liṅga, a cylindrical symbol with a spherical top. The word &#x2018;liṅga&#x2019; means that Supreme Power into which the whole universe dissolves at the end of creation (&#x2018;līyate asmin iti liṅgaḥ&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>A liṅga can be cala (movable) or acala (immovable). The liṅgas in Śiva temples are always acala. Such acala-liṅgas can be of several varieties—4 or 6 or even 9—of which the daivata-liṅga (also called &#x2018;daivika-liṅga&#x2019;) is one. Since it is supposed to have been established by the gods of heaven it gets this name (daiva = related to gods).</p>
			<p>Its shape resembles that of a flame of light and suggests to our mind hands folded in supplication. Its surface is rugged and contains marks of ṭaṅka (hammer) and śūla (spear). There is no brahmasūtra mark.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Vivāha or marriage has been a very ancient institution right from the times of the <em>Ṛgveda.</em> The mantras used in the marriage ceremonies of the dvijas (&#x2018;the twice-born,&#x2019; the brāhmaṇas, the kṣattriyas and the vaiśyas) even in the modern days draw heavily from the Vedic and allied literature.</p>
			<p>Of the eight forms of marriage depicted in the ancient works like the Gṛhyasūtras, the daiva-vivāha is also one and is classed among the superior varieties. It is described as gifting one&#x2019;s daughter, after properly decorating her, to a priest who has officiated in the sacrifice. It was almost like dakṣiṇā or sacrificial fee.</p>
			<p>It was called &#x2018;daiva&#x2019; since the sacrifice was for appeasing the devas or gods like Indra and the gifting of the girl took place as a part of the sacrifice.</p>
			<p>This form of marriage seems to have been discouraged and hence disappeared in course of time.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> is a cardinal scripture of Hinduism revered by all sections of the Hindus. It has also attracted the attention of many a spiritual seeker and savant from the great religions of the world.</p>
			<p>The sixteenth chapter of this work deals with two archetypes among the human beings—the āsuric or the demoniac and the daivī or the divine beings. The former are hostile to all moral and spiritual values whereas the latter are fully receptive to them.</p>
			<p>These moral and spiritual values listed in this chapter (16.1-3) are called &#x2018;daivīsampad&#x2019; or &#x2018;daivīsampat&#x2019;, a wealth (sampat = wealth) that ultimately leads to the attainment of the divine state (daivī = divine).</p>
			<p>They are: abhaya (fearlessness), sattvasaṁśuddhi (purity of the heart), jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti (steadfastness in knowledge and devotion), dāna (benevolence), dama (control of senses), yajña (worship), svādhyāya (study of the scriptures), tapas (austerity of body, speech and mind), ārjava (uprightness), ahiṁsā (non-violence), satya (truth), akrodha (freedom from anger), tyāga (renunciation), śānti (tranquillity), apaiśuna (aversion to slander), bhūteṣu dayā (compassion towards all living beings), aloluptva (freedom from sensuality), mārdava (gentleness), hrī (modesty), acāpala (steadiness), tejas (vigour), kṣamā (forgiveness), dhṛti (fortitude), śauca (purity), adroha (harmlessness), nātimānitā (freedom from vanity).</p>
			<p>It is obvious that these great qualities when practised properly and imbibed, will raise all human beings from the brute level to divine heights.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Ḍākinīs are—according to the tantras, texts of the Mother cult—a class of female spirits attending on the major goddesses in their fierce aspect, like Kālī. Their function is to assume terrible forms to instil fear in the hearts of people who are inimical to the devotees. They can also be benevolent spirits and guide the devotees, along the right path.</p>
			<p>These ḍākinīs are supposed to have burst forth from the derisive laughter of Śivadūtī (an aspect of Durgā) and fought with the rākṣasas or the demons in the armies of the demon king Ruru.</p>
			<p>A ḍākinī is shown as a goddess seated on a lotus pedestal with sixteen petals. She has four hands holding triśūla (trident), pātra (vessel), khaṭvāṅga (magical wand) and carma (shield). The vessel is filled with pudding if she is pictured as a benevolent goddess or with blood, if malevolent.</p>
			<p>Sometimes they are described as the guardian deities of dharma, and of their devotees, akin to the angels in Christian belief.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;able,&#x2019; &#x2018;competent&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>A prajāpati or Father of beings, Dakṣa is a familiar figure often mentioned in the Hindu mythological literature. There appear to be two Dakṣas, belonging to two different periods known as manvantaras. (See <ref>MANVANTARA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>The first belonged to the Svāyam-bhuva-manvantara and had married Prasūti, the daughter of the Manu Svayambhū. Out of the 24 daughters he begot in her, Satī was one who had been married to Śiva.</p>
			<p>Once a misunderstanding developed between Dakṣa and Śiva due to the apparent disrespect shown by the latter. When Dakṣa performed a big yajña or sacrifice, he ignored Śiva completely and did not invite him. However, Satī, due to her filial love towards her father Dakṣa, went to attend the same much against her husband Śiva&#x2019;s warning. Being incensed by the callous behaviour of her father she gave up her body in the hall of sacrifice itself in yoga. Enraged by this tragedy, Śiva got Dakṣa&#x2019;s sacrifice desecrated and destroyed through Vīrabhadra, a terrific emanation from himself. Dakṣa too was beheaded but was restored to life by the all-merciful Śiva at the importunate pleadings of the gods. Dakṣa&#x2019;s regrets and apology once again restored the good relationship between them.</p>
			<p>The second Dakṣa (of the Cākṣuṣa-manvantara) was commanded by Brahmā (creator) to proceed with the creation of living beings. He did so using his psychic powers. Devas (Gods), ṛṣis (sages), gandharvas ( a type of semi-divine beings), asuras (demons), sarpas (serpents) apart from human beings were all created by him.</p>
			<p>Dakṣa is also the name of an ancient author of a smṛti (a secondary scripture, a law-book) which is generally called <em>Dakṣasmṛti.</em> The extant work has seven chapters and 220 verses. The topics dealt with are varied. Apart from Varṇāśrama-dharmas, the subjects include the giving of gifts, eulogy of a good housewife, aśauca or ceremonial impurity to be observed on birth or death in one&#x2019;s family, certain aspects of yoga and the philosophy of advaita.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the important items of a Vedic sacrifice is dakṣiṇā or the fees to be paid to the priests involved in the conduct of the sacrifice. Generally cows and gold are considered superior among the various kinds of dakṣiṇās. Other animals, articles of food or anything that will be useful to the donees are also prescribed.</p>
			<p>Though it is limited to small quanti-ties in minor rites, fabulous amounts are expected to be given in complicated rites, such as the Rājasūyayāga.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that a non-brāhmaṇa may be given dakṣiṇā if he is learned, whereas, a brāhmaṇa of a different gotra (lineage) or who is not learned, is not entitled for it!</p>
			<p>A sacrifice where dakṣiṇā has not been paid becomes barren and the sacrificer&#x2019;s life is cut short by this serious defect.</p>
			<p>Even the act of giving dakṣiṇā is a ritual.</p>

			<p>The worship of the goddess Dakṣiṇa-kālikā, following the Vedic modes of pūjā and sādhanā, as also belief in the varṇāśrama system characterise the Dakṣiṇācāra.</p>

			<p>Every āhitāgni—one who ceremonially establishes the Vedic fires—is expected to keep three Vedic fires and the dakṣiṇāgni is one of them. It is situated within the sacrificial shed, near the main fire (the gārhapatya fire), to the south (dakṣiṇa = south). Hence this name. The fire-pit is semicircular or bow-shaped.</p>
			<p>This fire is established in various ways among which the following are more common: brought from the gārhapatya fire; from the house of a vaiśya or a rich man who has established it by attrition.</p>
			<p>It is to be preserved permanently since it protects the sacrificer from evil forces. Some works consider its establishment as optional. It is set up by the ādheya rite which is quite elaborate.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Though God is one, he assumes three aspects when engaged in the process of sṛṣṭi (creation), sthiti (preservation) and pralaya (destruction). They are: Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva (Rudra or Maheśvara).</p>
			<p>Out of the several forms of Śiva described in the purāṇas and the āgamas, the Dakṣiṇāmūrti is also one.</p>
			<p>It is a benign aspect of his. Since he was facing south (dakṣiṇa = south) at the time of teaching the sages in a secluded spot in the Himālayas, he came to be known as Dakṣiṇāmūrti. Sometimes the word &#x2018;dakṣiṇā&#x2019; is interpreted as jñāna, knowledge or wisdom, in which case he represents the very personification of knowledge and wisdom.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>He is shown with three eyes, four arms and two legs and is seated under banyan tree. Two of the hands (the front right and the front left) are showing jñānamudrā and varadamudrā, postures of imparting knowledge and giving gifts respectively. In the other two hands—the back ones—he is holding the akṣamālā (rosary) and agni (fire) or a serpent. Sometimes he is pictured as playing on a Vīṇā or lute. Other texts portray him as holding a paraśu (axe) and hariṇī (antelope) instead of the rosary and fire. One of the legs is trampling upon the apasmārapuruṣa (cretinous person) signifying ignorance.</p>
			<p>The tāntrik works describe him as white in complexion.</p>
			<p>He may be shown as surrounded by several ṛṣis or sages eager to learn spiritual wisdom from him.</p>
			<p>Several forms of Dakṣiṇāmūrti are also described in the tāntrik works. Some of them are: Saṁhāra-Dakṣiṇāmūrti, Lakuṭi-Dakṣiṇāmūrti, Medhā-Dakṣiṇā-mūrti, Sāmba-Dakṣiṇāmūrti and so on. Each one of these is, iconographically speaking, sculptured in a different manner.</p>
			<p>His worship may involve elaborate rituals. His yantra (magical diagram) is a lotus with eight petals on which the deities Brahmā, Sarasvatī, Gaṇapati and some sages are inscribed.</p>

			<word>Dakṣiṇāmūrti Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a short Upaniṣad of 33 verses, assigned to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>, but classed among the minor ones. It deals mainly with the meditation on Dakṣiṇā-mūrti, an aspect of Śiva representing a teacher of divine wisdom.</p>
			<p>Once, a group of sages under the leadership of Śaunaka, approached the deathless sage Mārkaṇḍeya with due respect and asked him how he had attained the cirajīvatva or the deathless state as also eternal bliss. He replied, &#x2018;By the esoteric knowledge of the principle of Śiva.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Then they put him nine questions:</p>
			<p>What is that esoteric knowledge of the principle of Śiva? Who is the deity in it? Which are the mantras (spiritual formulae)? What is the steadfast devotion needed? What is the means of attaining that knowledge? What is its instrument? What is the offering? What is its final state? What is the final abode?</p>
			<p>The esoteric knowledge of Śiva is the realisation of him in his aspect as Dakṣiṇā-mūrti. Śiva is called Dakṣiṇāmūrti since he can silently give the gift (= dakṣiṇā) of Self-knowledge to anyone that is seen by him.</p>
			<p>He himself is the deity (= deva) since he shines (deva = one who shines) in his own glory and joy at the time of dissolution of the world.</p>
			<p>As regards the mantras, the Upaniṣad offers five of them:</p>
			<p type="poem">(1) Oṁ namo bhagavate dakṣiṇāmūrtaye<br />mahyam medhām prajñām<br />prayaccha svāhā ||</p>
			<p type="poem">(2) Oṁ dakṣiṇāmūrtir-atarom ||</p>

			<p>The steadfast devotion needed is the conviction that one is Brahman, which should last till the death of the body.</p>
			<p>The means of attaining that know-ledge is the repetition of the mantra (one of the five already given) with the conscious thinking that one is identical with the deity denoted by the mantra.</p>
			<p>The instrument is singular devotion to the mantra.</p>

			<p>The final state is the attainment of the perfect equanimity of the three guṇas.</p>

			<p>According to the purāṇas which contain a lot of geographical and historical material on India, the Bhāratavarṣa is a part of the Jambūdvīpa and is divided into seven regions.</p>
			<p>Dakṣiṇāpatha is that region which is south of the river Narmadā. Its extent is about one-fourth of Bāratavarṣa. Some of the people inhabiting this region are: Pāṇḍyas, Keraḷas, Coḷas, Setukas, Mūṣikas, Kumāras, Māhiṣakas, Kāveras, Vidarbhas, Daṇḍakas, Āndhras, Ṛṣikas, Kuntalas and so on.</p>
			<p>The modern Deccan region is almost the same as Dakṣiṇāpatha.</p>

			<p>Visiting a famous place of pilgrimage at least once in a life-time has been a great ambition cherished by all devout Hindus. And, such places of pilgrimage are legion in Hinduism. Many of these pilgrim centres have acquired their importance due to their intimate association with great saints and religious leaders.</p>
			<p>One such place, of a rather recent origin, is Dakṣiṇeśvara, now a part of the city of Calcutta. Due to its close connection with the life of Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa (A. D. 1836-1886) it is now attracting thousands of votaries and visitors throughout the year.</p>
			<p>As one enters the temple complex from the riverside through the landing ghāṭ on the eastern bank of the Ganges river, one comes to the main portico called &#x2018;Cāndni&#x2019;. On either side of it are the Śiva temples six to the north and six to the south. They are all identical. One has to cross the open courtyard to reach the temple of Kālī, the main shrine.</p>
			<p>Built by Rāṇī Rāsamaṇi (A. D. 1793-1861), a rich landlady, in 1855, this temple of Kālī is the central attraction of this place. The goddess is known as &#x2018;Bhava-tāriṇī&#x2019;, &#x2018;redeemer from the sufferings of the world&#x2019;. The image has been carved out of a single piece of basalt and faces south. The deity is standing on the chest of Śiva (her spouse) who lies prostrate on a thousand-petalled silver lotus. The height of the image is 85 cms. (33.5 inches) and the shrine-room is 4.5 metres (15 ft.) square excluding the raised plinth and the overall height is more than 33 metres (100 ft.).</p>
			<p>Open on all sides and facing the main shrine is the Nāṭmandir (literally, &#x2018;dance-hall&#x2019;) measuring 22.5 metres (75 ft.) by 15 metres (50 ft.). It is meant for meditation and religio-cultural activities like devotional music, dramas and dances with religious themes.</p>
			<p>Behind the temple of Kālī stands another temple dedicated to Kṛṣṇa in his Rādhākānta aspect. The images of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā are 55 cms. (21.5 inches) and 40 cms. (16 inches) respectively.</p>
			<p>Other holy spots in the campus are: Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa&#x2019;s room, Nahabat and Bakultala ghāṭ, the Pañcavaṭī and the Bel tree as also the small cottage or meditation hut.</p>
			<p>Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa spent nearly thirty years of his life in that room. The room is about 7 metres (24 ft.) square. The two wooden cots—one smaller than the other—which he was using have been preserved. The room opens on to a semicircular verandah to the west which faces the Ganges river.</p>
			<p>The Nahabat or music tower is to the north of Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa&#x2019;s room and has an octagonal room on the ground-floor measuring 2.3 metres (7.75 ft.) across. The entrance door is hardly 1.2 metres (4 ft.) in height. Śrī Sāradā Devī (better known as the Holy Mother) lived in this room. Candrādevī, mother of Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa, lived on the first floor.</p>
			<p>The Bakultala-ghāṭ is the bathing ghāṭ (close to the Nahabat) of the Ganges river, which Śrī Sāradā Devī used to use.</p>
			<p>The Pañcavaṭī is a grove of five sacred trees intended as a place for spiritual practices. It was renovated by Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa himself.</p>
			<p>The Bel tree which is a little away from the Pañcavaṭī is the very tree under which Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa practised severe tāntric disciplines guided by Bhairavī Brāhmaṇī.</p>
			<p>The small cottage is the very meditation room where the great saint attained Advaitic samādhi under the guidance of the monk Totāpurī.</p>

			<p>All the Hindu philosophical systems which accept the authority of the Vedas, posit mokṣa or liberation from transmigratory existence, as the final goal of life. This becomes possible only when one realises one&#x2019;s real nature as the ātman, the Self, of the nature of pure consciousness, totally different from the body-mind complex. This, again, involves a lot of spiritual struggle wherein one has to conquer the pulls and pushes of the powerful sense-organs and sense-objects. &#x2018;Dama&#x2019; is the technical term given to this aspect of spiritual discipline, by the Vedāntic treatises, especially the Upaniṣads and the <em>Bhagavadgītā.</em></p>
			<p>It is generally defined as restraining and pulling back the external sense-organs like the eyes and the ears from all those objects which do not aid the meditation on the ātman, but try to distract and disturb the mind.</p>

			<word>ḍamaru</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;a small drum&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Pictures and images of Śiva (one of the major forms of God in Hinduism) show him as holding the triśūla (trident) and the ḍamaru (a small drum) in his hands.</p>
			<p>The ḍamaru which is a folk or tribal musical instrument of the percussion type, is in extensive use even now in the rural parts of India, especially by the folk-dancers and priests of the tāntrik tradition. It is a sort of kettle-drum, very small in size. It is made of two inverted bowls of wood or clay, the open ends being covered with parchment or thin leather. Strings with beads at their ends are attached to the slender middle portion. When the drum is rhythmically shaken by hand, a pleasant rattling sound is produced, as the beads strike the membrane on the open ends.</p>
			<p>In the images of Śiva (especially the dancing ones like Naṭarāja) the ḍamaru is held in the upper right hand.</p>
			<p>According to some mythological accounts, Śiva, at the request of the gods in heaven, is said to have danced with power and grace—a rare combination indeed—using the ḍamaru and sounding it fourteen times. Each time, the sound that emerged, formed a specific pattern, giving rise to the fourteen basic aphorisms of Sanskrit grammar (called <em>Māheśvara-sūtras</em>, like &#x2018;a-i-uṇ,&#x2019; &#x2018;ṛ-lṛk&#x2019; and so on). Consequently the symbolical meaning of the ḍamaru in Śiva&#x2019;s hand is sound or alphabets or grammar or language. It may also represent the ākāśa or the ether principle, the first of the five basic elements in the process of creation of the world.</p>

			<word>dāna</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;gift&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Giving gifts to worthy persons has been considered as a meritorious act of great value by all the important religions of the world. The most common Sanskrit word for giving gifts is &#x2018;dāna.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Having had its origin in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself, the concept has gradually evolved to an astonishing degree of details as also finesse over the centuries. It has been extolled as equal to tapas or austerity and as a primary religious duty of this Kaliyuga or Iron-age.</p>
			<p>The concept first appears in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (1.125.6) as dakṣiṇā or sacrificial fee to be paid to the priests and the gifts of cows and gold to deserving persons. Anna-dāna or giving food to hungry beings has also been extolled there highly (10.117).</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣads describe dāna as a religious duty and as a discipline that helps one to conquer one&#x2019;s greedy nature. The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (16.1; 17.20-22) calls it as a divine quality and classifies it into three categories.</p>
			<p>However, it is in the dharmaśāstras (independent compendiums on the various aspects of dharma, as related to varṇa and āśrama) and the purāṇas that the meticulously worked out details about dāna are met with.</p>
			<p>Dāna may be nitya (obligatory dailyduty), naimittika (occasional), kāmya (desire-motivated) or vimala (pure). Giving food to hungry beings as a part of daily duties, gifting of useful things on special occasions like the periods of eclipses, presenting cows or other prescribed things as a part of rituals performed with desires and donations conferred upon persons of saintly character with the sole object of pleasing God are, respectively, the examples for these four categories mentioned above.</p>
			<p>Apart from this, it is also emphasised that dāna should be given unostentatiously and unknown to others.</p>
			<p>Since dāna has been considered as a religious act and has also acquired a ritualistic colour, certain rules and regulations, some formalities, have come to be associated with the same.</p>
			<p>The dātā or the giver of gifts must be free from incurable diseases and heinous sins, be virtuous and clean, and must have acquired his wealth by right means.</p>
			<p>The receiver must really be in need of what he is asking for, and these may be basic things required for a living like food, clothing, shelter or money. Persons of evil or doubtful character like gamblers, cheats, drunkards or criminals should not be helped with gifts.</p>
			<p>It is essential that the giver must have śraddhā or faith in the act of giving as religious or meritorious. It is this that really matters and not the quality or the quantity, though a minimum standard <em>is</em> expected to make it really useful.</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras vehemently oppose the gifts made by persons who have amassed wealth by unrighteous means. The receiver too should never accept them if he knows about it!</p>
			<p>A householder should never give gifts beyond his means and should not make his family and dependents suffer on account of it. Generally ten per cent of the earnings is given as the limit for giving gifts.</p>
			<p>Mention is also made of certain things which should not be given nor accepted as gifts. No one can gift away things that do not rightfully belong to him—as for instance, things that have been borrowed from others or kept in one&#x2019;s safe keeping!</p>
			<p>Similarly there are restrictions with regard to accepting things if they are against one&#x2019;s svadharma or sense of righteousness and prescribed duties. For example, a brāhmaṇa devoted to Vedic learning and a purely spiritual life, should not accept weapons or intoxicating substances even if offered.</p>
			<p>The religious works prescribe certain periods or times as very auspicious for giving gifts. Among them are the two solstices (summer and winter), days of eclipses of the sun and the moon, new-moon and full-moon days as also important festival days.</p>
			<p>Gifts given in places of pilgrimage are also extolled highly.</p>
			<p>Objects once given away as a gift should never be taken back. This applies even to promises of gifts.</p>
			<p>Gifts given by mentally deranged persons or those suffering from very serious illnesses or immature young children are considered invalid for obvious reasons.</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras and the purāṇas eulogise certain special gifts like godāna (gift of cows) and suvarṇadāna (gift of gold) as also tulāpuruṣa (weighing a person against the things to be gifted and then give them away).</p>
			<p>Gift of knowledge, especially spiritual wisdom, has been considered as the highest and the best gift.</p>
			<p>To summarise: </p>
			<ul calss="lower-alpha">
				<li>Giving dāna or gifts is a sacred act that helps one to earn religious merit.</li>
				<li>One can give gifts only from what one has earned by right means.</li>
				<li>One should never give beyond one&#x2019;s means and capacity.</li>
				<li>Things given should be useful to the donee.</li>
				<li>Rules concerning time, place and occasion should be observed as far as possible.</li>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Depiction of the conflict between the forces of good and evil is a common phenomenon seen in many cultures and civilisations of the world. In the Hindu scriptures including the mythological works, such conflicts are always described as wars between the suras and the asuras or the devas and the dānavas.</p>
			<p>These &#x2018;anti-gods&#x2019; or evil beings are described by various names such as asuras, daityas, dānavas and rākṣasas. Asuras are those addicted to sense-pleasures and hence opposed to all spiritual values and ways of life. Daityas and dānavas are, respectively, the sons of Diti and Danu, two of the thirteen wives of the sage Kaśyapa, one of the Prajāpatis or progenitors of mankind. Strangely enough, the devas or gods are also the sons of Kaśyapa, but from his virtuous wife Aditi. (Hence the name &#x2018;āditeyas&#x2019; for the devas.)</p>
			<p>The rākṣasas are the children of Khasā the father, again, being Kaśyapa.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, in the mythological lore, all these three—the daityas, the dānavas and the rākṣasas—are bracketed and treated as one type.</p>
			<p>Perhaps, the daityas and the dānavas may be taken as archetypes of races, physically stronger and more prone to violence, though, even among them there have been good ones like Prahlāda and Bali. The rākṣasas could be classed as even one shade worse, as evil-doers.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;daṇḍa&#x2019; is one of the commonest terms that we come across in the dharmaśāstras and allied works. Etymologically, it means anything by which control is exercised, including punishment.</p>
			<p>In its simplest form it means a stick or a rod. The stick that a Vedic student or an itinerant monk keeps constantly with him for protection in emergencies is a &#x2018;daṇḍa&#x2019;. It also acts as a symbol of self-control.</p>
			<p>In the purāṇas, it is the rod of death or punishment, in the hands of Yama, the god of death. Consequently he is also called &#x2018;daṇḍadhara&#x2019; or the wielder of the daṇḍa.</p>
			<p>A daṇḍa can also be in the form of a long staff, a cudgel or a stick often unornamented, and is shown in the hands of some images like those of Kārttikeya (or Subrahmaṇya), the minor deities such as Maṅgala, Śukra and Śani (planet-deities), Kapila and even the goddess Rati (wife of Kāmadeva or cupid).</p>
			<p>As applied to a king it can mean the armed forces, one of the seven rājyāṅgas or constituents of a State. As one of the four &#x2018;upāyas&#x2019; or means of achieving the desired end, especially while dealing with hostile kings, it means war, but as a last resort.</p>
			<p>The word is sometimes used as a unit of time, an equivalent of &#x2018;ghaṭikā,&#x2019; and is equal to 24 minutes.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Standard works on Haṭhayoga like the <em>Gheraṇḍa Saṁhitā</em> give various cleansing processes, generally called &#x2018;dhauti&#x2019;, to purify the body and make it healthy and strong. It is only such a healthy body that is fit to practise other forms of yoga like Rājayoga.</p>
			<p>The daṇḍadhauti is one such process and is one of three classed under hṛd-dhauti. (See <ref>HṚDDHAUTI </ref>also.)</p>
			<p>The yogi takes the plantain stalk or the stalk of a turmeric plant or cane and thrusts it slowly into the esophagus and then draws it out slowly. By this process the phlegm, bile and other impurities are expelled out of the mouth.</p>
			<p>Like the other practices of Haṭhayoga, this too should be practised under the direct guidance of an expert teacher, as otherwise, it may prove to be dangerous.</p>

			<p>According to the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> of Vālmīki, the Daṇḍakāraṇya is the forest where Śrī Rāma, the banished king of Ayodhyā, spent most of his years of exile.</p>
			<p>Daṇḍaka was one of the hundred princes, sons of the king Ikṣvāku, who had been assigned to rule over this area. His villainous nature made him molest Arajā, the daughter of his own guru, Śukrācārya. Consequently, he incurred the wrath of Śukrācārya who cursed him. As a result, Daṇḍaka and his entire entourage was decimated and the kingdom itself reduced to a barren land, leaving a small part. Hence the name Daṇḍaka or Daṇḍakāraṇya to this region. It was also known—later on—as Janasthāna since several sages (jana = people) came there and settled down.</p>
			<p>The area around the modern town of Nāsik (in Maharashtra) has now been identified as a part of Daṇḍakāraṇya.</p>

			<p>Though, literally, the word means anyone who holds a daṇḍa or a staff in his hand, it is a technical term used to indicate the saṁnyāsins or monks. The daṇḍa or the staff which is a part and parcel of their monastic apparel is a constant reminder that the saṁnyāsin has to be ever vigilant to practise dama or self-control in all its aspects.</p>
			<p>The daṇḍīs are of two types: the ekadaṇḍīs and the tridaṇḍīs. Whereas the former hold only one staff, the latter hold one, made of three sticks tied into one unit.</p>
			<p>The single staff reminds its wearer that he has to keep his mind always under control and the three-in-one staff symbolises the control of the body, the speech and the mind.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu sages were very particular about personal hygiene since cleanliness of the body and the surroundings was conducive to the cleanliness and peace of mind. Hence, the writers of the dharma-śāstras have dealt with this aspect of one&#x2019;s life—generally grouped under the titles āhnika and ācāra—in meticulous detail.</p>
			<p>Dantadhāvana or cleaning one&#x2019;s teeth is one of the earliest acts in one&#x2019;s daily routine. It is generally done with a small piece of a twig with its bark, taken from certain specified plants or trees (having medicinal properties) after shaping it like a toothbrush by crushing one of its ends. It is interesting to note that even this simple act of cleaning one&#x2019;s teeth has to be accompanied by the chanting of certain mantras, the main purport of which is prayer for a long life, health and strength as also good memory and intelligence.</p>
			<p>It is to be repeated, though in a modified form, in the night also.</p>

			<p>Also spelt as Dantavaktra (&#x2018;One whose mouth is full of teeth,&#x2019; i.e., one with protruded teeth) was the prince of the country of Karūṣa (in Kaliṅga, identi-fied with the modern Orissa). He was a nephew of Vasudeva, father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Being a close friend of Śiśupāla who blasphemed Śrī Kṛṣṇa during the Rājasūya sacrifice of the Pāṇḍavas and got killed by him, he invaded Dvārakā along with his another friend Sālva. However, he was killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the duel. At the time of his death, a light emerged out of his body and got merged in Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This is because he was actually Jaya (one of the two gate keepers of Vaikuṇṭha) reborn as Dantavakra due to the curse of the sages, Sanatkumāra and others.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Right from the Vedic times certain varieties of grass like the darbha have been considered as sacred and have been used in the sacrificial rites. Since a dry piece of this grass can cut our skin (dṛ = to cut) it might have got this name. Sometimes it has been identified with the kuśa grass and sometimes described as different. But in today&#x2019;s ritualistic practices the two names refer to the same (kuśa) grass.</p>
			<p>In the <em>Atharvaveda</em> (6.43) it is mentioned that it can be used as an amulet for protection against certain evils.</p>
			<p>Works on the Āyurveda predicate several uses to this grass such as appetising, purification of blood and semen, curing of certain diseases like jaundice and herpes.</p>
			<p>The botanical names given for this grass are: <em>Saccharum cylindricum</em> or <em>Poa cynosuroides.</em></p>

			<p>The word &#x2018;darpaṇa&#x2019; is one of the common terms that indicates a mirror. It has been so called since it increases the &#x2018;darpa&#x2019; or the pride of a beautiful or a handsome person!</p>
			<p>A mirror is one of the several objects that is shown in the hands of a female figurine or a goddess, sculptured according to the rules of the Mūrtiśilpaśāstra or Hindu Iconography.</p>
			<p>It is also one of the aṣṭamaṅgalas—eight objects signifying auspiciousness—normally used on auspicious occasions like the coronation of a king.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Though the word means &#x2018;seeing&#x2019;, it is often used in a technical sense, indicating any system of philosophy. Generally the Indian philosophical systems are called &#x2018;darśanas&#x2019; since they claim to have been based on the &#x2018;seeing&#x2019; or the &#x2018;experiencing&#x2019; of the final truths.</p>
			<p>These darśanas are classified into two broad groups: the āstika-darśanas and the nāstika-darśanas. The former accept the authority of the Vedas whereas the latter do not.</p>
			<p>The former, being six in number, is often called &#x2018;ṣaḍdarśanas&#x2019; (ṣaṭ = six) They are:  the Nyāyadarśana of Gautama  the Vaiśeṣikadarśana of Kaṇāda  the Sāṅkhyadarśana of Kapila  the Yogadarśana of Patañjali  the Mīmāṁsādarśana of Jaimini  and the Vedāntadarśana of Bādarāyaṇa. The latter are:  the Cārvākadarśana of Cārvāka  the Jainadarśana  and the Bauddhadarśana.</p>
			<p>The last two represent the various philosophical systems of Jainism and Buddhism. The first represents materialism of various shades and hues. Though the work itself is not available now, excerpts from it have been quoted in the treatises of other writers.</p>

			<word>Darśapūrṇamāsa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Vedic sacrifices—called yajñas and yāgas—are an ancient institution. One of its varieties is &#x2018;iṣṭi,&#x2019; a sacrifice performed with the four priests adhvaryu, āgnīdhra, hotṛ and brahman. (See under each title for details.) The Darśapūrṇamāsa is a prakṛti (an archetype) in this iṣṭi group and is obligatory.</p>
			<p>The words &#x2018;darśa&#x2019; and &#x2018;pūrṇamāsa&#x2019; actually stand for the new-moon and the full-moon days. Hence, the Vedic rites to be performed on these days have also been named &#x2018;Darśa&#x2019; and &#x2018;Pūrṇamāsa&#x2019;. The two are identical in almost all respects except for some minor variations. Consequently, they are often clubbed together and called, &#x2018;Darśapūrṇamāsa.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The Darśa sacrifice is done on the new-moon day and the day next to it (pratipad). The Pūrṇamāsa is performed on the full-moon day and the following day.</p>
			<p>The only difference in the procedure between these two sacrifices is that the puroḍāśa (rice-cake) is offered to Indra and Agni in the Darśa whereas the same is offered to Agni-Soma in the Pūrṇamāsa.</p>
			<p>The preliminaries like shaving, bathing and fasting are done by the sacrificer on the day called &#x2018;upavasaha&#x2019; (= fasting and living near the fire). This is followed by anvādhāna (offering of three pieces of sacrificial wood into the fire). The other rites to follow are: piṇḍapitṛyajña (obsequial rites for the forefathers up to three generations); usual daily Agnihotra; preparing the curdled milk for offering on the next day; preparing the puroḍāśa (rice-cakes) for offering; repetition of the sāmidhenī verses (eleven verses from the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, mostly from the third Maṇḍala, aimed at kindling the fire); āghāra libation (wherein the adhvaryu pours ghee into the fire moving the spoon all over, with appropriate mantras) and five prayāja and two ājyabhāga oblations (preliminary offerings).</p>
			<p>Then, the principle offerings are made with puroḍāśa (rice-cakes) to the accompaniment of puro&#x2019;nuvākyas (call or invitation to the deities by the hotṛ priest) and yājyās (technical formulae of consecration chanted by the hotṛ priest while the adhvaryu priest offers a libation of ghee).</p>
			<p>In the Darśa, eleven offerings of Puroḍāśa kept in small earthen plates are offered to Indra and Agni. In the Pūrṇa-māsa, the offerings are made to Agni and Soma.</p>
			<p>This is followed by the sviṣṭakṛt offering (a secondary offering to Agni by whose goodwill the sacrifice has been successfully done) and iḍābhakṣaṇa (eating the portions cut off from all the main offerings) by the priests.</p>
			<p>Then comes anuyāja (three supplementary offerings) followed by sūktavāka (speech of adoration by the hotṛ priest) and śaṁyuvāka (formula of benediction, also by the hotṛ priest).</p>
			<p>After a few more minor rites like the patnīsaṁyāja (offerings to the consorts of the deities), removal of the yoktra (a belt of muñja grass), prāyaścittas (expiatory rites) and viṣṇukrama (ceremonially taking four steps with appropriate mantras, by the yajamāna or the sacrificer) the whole sacrifice comes to a close.</p>

			<word>dārujaliṅga</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;Śivaliṅga made out of wood&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Unlike the other deities, Śiva (one of the three aspects of the Supreme, the aspect of involution or withdrawal or destruction of the world) is invariably worshipped in the form of a liṅga. A liṅga is an icon, cylindrical in shape, with a spherical top. Since God is beyond name and form and since we cannot conceive of an abstract principle like him without the aid of concrete symbols, a spherical surface or emblem is perhaps the nearest approach to him.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Dāru&#x2019; means wood. Liṅgas carved out of wood are called &#x2018;dārujaliṅgas&#x2019;. They are of the sthāvara or stationary type. The minimum and maximum heights prescribed for such liṅgas are 16 and 144 aṅgulas. (One aṅgula is roughly 1.9 cms. or 0.75 inch.)</p>
			<p>The dārujaliṅgas are classified into 9 or even 33 varieties, depending upon their height. For instance, if the makara-liṅga is 16 aṅgulas in height (the minimum height permitted), the daṇḍaliṅga is 80 aṅgulas and the phalodbhava liṅga is 144 aṅgulas (the maximum permissible height).</p>
			<p>As regards the type of wood out of which it is carved, about 20 varieties are recommended. Some of them are: śamī (<em>Prosopsis spieigera</em>), devadāru (<em>Cedrus deodara</em>), candana (sandalwood), bilva (<em>Aegle marmelos</em>), aśvattha (peepul tree) and aśoka (<em>Saraca asoca</em>).</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;dāsa&#x2019; occurs in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (5.34.6; 6.22.10) many times and refers to the enemies of the Vedic people. Since these dāsas were, in many cases, reduced to slavery, the term has been used in the sense of a &#x2018;slave&#x2019; also. (See <ref>SLAVERY</ref>.)</p>
			<p>In later literature, the word refers to a paid servant.</p>
			<p>While naming a person, this word was used as a suffix for persons belonging to the śūdra caste.</p>
			<p>In the devotional literature, this expression has been widely used to indicate a devotee as a servant of God or as a servant of the devotees of God. For instance: Rāmadāsa, Kṛṣṇadāsa, Caṇḍī-dāsa and so on.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Festivals and sacred days have a very important part to play in popular Hinduism. They often act as a catalytic agent to integrate the various sections of the Hindu society.</p>
			<p>One of the minor festivals, observed mostly in North India and also on the banks of the big rivers like Kṛṣṇā, Godāvarī and Narmadā, is the Daśaharā (also called Gaṅgā-daśaharā). It occurs on the tenth day of the bright fortnight (śukla-daśamī) of the month of Jyeṣṭha (May-June). The river Gaṅgā is believed to have descended to the earth on this day. If the day happens to be a Tuesday or a Wednesday it is considered even more auspicious. A bath in the river Gaṅgā, especially at the Daśāśvamedha-ghāṭ of Vārāṇasī or Kāśī (in Uttar Pradesh) on this day is said to destroy ten kinds of sins associated with the body, speech and mind. The bath should be followed by worship of the prescribed deity and giving gifts to worthy persons.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The religion of the Vedic Āryans comprised mostly of the performance of Vedic sacrifices. Out of these, Agnyādheya or Agnyādhāna was a primary rite meant for generating the Vedic fires like the gārhapatya. These fires had to be maintained for life and all other sacrifices had to be performed only in them.</p>
			<p>The &#x2018;daśahotāraḥ&#x2019; is actually a formula of ten sentences taken from the <em>Taittirīya Āraṇyaka</em> (3.1). These mantras have to be repeated when the upper araṇi is placed on the lower one before churning, for generating the fire.</p>
			<p>These ten short sentences (oṁ cittiḥ sruk; cittam ājyam; vāg vediḥ and so on) actually identify ten different parts of the human body with ten things connected with the sacrifice.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In the religio-philosophical literature of Hinduism both bhakti (devotion) and jñāna (knowledge) have been given equal prominence. The various teachers of bhakti, over the centuries, gave the common masses a simple philosophy of life to live by. This they did through their teachings, mostly in the form of devotional songs.</p>
			<p>The tradition of devotion with its popular religion and ethics, was originated in North India by the musician-saints like Tulasīdās (A. D. 1532-1623), Kabīr (A. D. 1440-1518), Nānak (A. D. 1469-1539), Mīrābāī (A. D. 1450-1547) and others. In Maharashtra, it was Sant Jñāneśvar (13th cent. A. D.), Ekanāth (A. D. 1533-1599), Tukārām (A. D. 1607-1694), Rāmadās (A. D. 1608-1681) and a host of others who did the same. In Bengal, Śrīkṛṣṇa Caitanya (A. D. 1485-1533), Rāmaprasād (A. D. 1720-1781) and Kamalākānta (A. D. 1800 ?) were the important teachers.</p>
			<p>In South India, the Āḷvārs (7th to 9th centuries A. D.) and Nāyanmārs (7th and 8th centuries A. D.) spread the cult of bhakti in the Tamil country. The Śiva-śaraṇas (12th cent. A. D.) and the Haridāsas (15th cent. A. D.) were the pioneers of the bhakti movement in Karnataka.</p>
			<p>The Haridāsa movement comprised two parallel but closely knit units, generally called the &#x2018;Vyāsakūṭa&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Dāsakūṭa&#x2019;. The former was nourished by the saṁnyāsins of the Mādhva school like Śrīpādarāya (15th cent. A. D.) and Vyāsa-rāya (A. D. 1447-1539) whereas the latter was sustained by Purandaradāsa (A. D. 1484-1564), Kanakadāsa (15th cent. A. D.), Vijayadāsa (A. D. 1687-1755) and other householder-devotees of the same school.</p>
			<p>Though the Vyāsakūṭa derived its name from Vyāsarāya (also known as Vyāsatīrtha) who was responsible for the phenomenal growth of both the units, it was Śrīpādarāya who was the pioneer of both.</p>
			<p>The saṁnyāsin teachers were great scholars both in Sanskrit and in Kannaḍa (the vernacular of Karnataka). They composed scholarly works in the former and popular devotional songs in the latter. The Haridāsas—though quite a few of them also were great scholars—concentrated on spreading the cult of devotion and the Dvaita Vedānta of Madhvācārya (A. D. 1197-1276) as also simple ethical principles through their songs which became very popular over the centuries.</p>
			<p>Apart from Purandaradāsa and Vijayadāsa, Gopāladāsa (A. D. 1721-1762) and Jagannāthadāsa (A. D. 1728-1809) too have contributed profusely to the Haridāsa literature.</p>
			<p>Some of the other Haridāsas who contributed significantly to the Dāsakūṭa and the bhakti movement are: Vaikuṇṭha-dāsa, Prasanna-Veṅkaṭadāsa, Timmaṇṇa-dāsa, Mohanadāsa, Heḷavanakaṭṭe Giri-yamma (a lady-saint), Kallūru Subbaṇṇa-dāsa, Aijīdāsa and so on.</p>
			<p>The Vijayanagara city and the Raichur district of Karnataka were the main centres of origin and activities of these Haridāsas.</p>
			<p>The compositions of these Haridāsas are legion. Their chief characteristic is simplicity. They express the profound truths of Vedānta in a simple language and urge the people to lead a God-centred life even while discharging one&#x2019;s normal duties in the world. The topics generally dealt with are: description of God&#x2019;s form and beauty (almost always as Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa), childhood pranks of Kṛṣṇa, various devotional practices like repetition of the divine name or singing the glories of God, moral principles like satya (truth) and dharma (righteous living), evil nature of the evil ones (in order to avoid such conduct), some paurāṇic stories as also autobiographical references, activism as well as dependence on God and a host of other miscellaneous subjects.</p>
			<p>The contribution of the Dāsakūṭa to Hindu religion and culture through the life and literature of the various Haridāsas is considerable.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;ten great representa-tions of knowledge&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Ten aspects of Śakti are sometimes described in tāntric works. They are termed &#x2018;Daśamahāvidyā&#x2019;s. These are the representations of transcendental know-ledge and power, the sources of all that is to be known.</p>
			<p>The first is Kālī, the goddess of time, that destroys everything. Tārā, the second, is the power of the golden embryo (Hiraṇya-garbha) from which the universe evolves. She also stands for void or the boundless space. The third is Ṣoḍaśī. The word literally means &#x2018;one who is sixteen years old.&#x2019; She is the personification of fullness, of perfection. Bhuvaneśvarī, the fourth Vidyā, represents the forces of the material world, whereas Bhairavī the fifth, stands for desires and temptations leading to destruction and death. Then comes Chinnamastā, the naked deity holding her own severed head in hand and drinking her own blood! She simply represents the continued state of self-sustenance of the created world in which are seen continuous self-destruction and self-renewal, in a cyclic order. Dhūmāvatī, the seventh, personifies the destruction of the world by fire, when only smoke (Dhūma) from its ashes remains. She is sometimes identified with Alakṣmī or Jyeṣṭhādevī. The eighth Vidyā, Bagalā, is a crane-headed goddess, and represents the ugly side of living creatures like jealousy, hatred and cruelty. Mātaṅgī, the ninth, is the embodiment of the power of domination. The tenth and the last, Kamalā, is the pure consciousness of the Self, bestowing boons and allaying the fears of the supplicants. She is identified with Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Saṁnyāsa or monasticism is a very ancient institution. The dharmaśāstras list it as the fourth and last stage in a man&#x2019;s life. (See <ref>ĀŚRAMA</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>Organised monasticism into a regular Order (in Hinduism)—though common among the Buddhists—can be attributed to Śaṅkara&#x2019;s (A. D. 788-820) pioneering efforts. He established four centres of his monastic order at Badarī (in Uttar Pradesh), Dvārakā (in Gujarat), Purī (in Orissa) and Śṛṅgerī (in Karnataka). They have been christened as Jyotir Maṭha (or Jośi Maṭha), Kālikā Maṭha, Govardhana Maṭha and Śāradā Maṭha respectively. He is said to have appointed his four chief disciples as the first abbots of these Maṭhas as follows: Toṭaka (Jyotir Maṭha), Padmapāda (Kālikā Maṭha), Hastāmalaka (Govardhana Maṭha) and Sureśvara (Śṛṅgerī Śāradā Maṭha).</p>
			<p>He also organised his saṁnyāsin disciples and the tradition of ascetics through them, into ten orders, known as &#x2018;daśanāmī-sampradāya&#x2019;, (daśa = ten, nāmī = with name; hence &#x2018;daśanāmī&#x2019;) of the following titles:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Araṇya;</li>
				<li>Āśrama;</li>
				<li>Bhāratī;</li>
				<li>Giri;</li>
				<li>Parvata;</li>
				<li>Purī; </li>
				<li>Sarasvatī;</li>
				<li>Sāgara;</li>
				<li>Tīrtha and </li>
				<li>Vana. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Every saṁnyāsin of these orders adds to his adopted name one of these ten titles as a suffix. For instance: Vidyāraṇya, Nṛsiṁhabhārati, Ānandagiri, Totāpurī, Ānandatīrtha and so on.</p>
			<p>These ten orders have been specifically aligned with the four maṭhas as follows:</p>
			<p>Jyotirmaṭha—Giri, Parvata and Sāgara.<br />Śāradāmaṭha—Āśrama and Tīrtha.<br />Govardhanamaṭha—Araṇya and Vana.<br />Śṛṅgerīmaṭha—Bhāratī, Purī and Sarasvatī.</p>
			<p>Though it is difficult to derive any definite conclusions as to the meanings of these ten terms which may not be related to their normal meanings, traditional interpretations and explanations are on the following lines:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Araṇya</td>
					<td>indicates a monk living in an araṇya or a forest, completely detached from mundane affairs.</td>

			<p>The Daśanāmī monks are further classified into four sampradāyas or traditional sects or groups without reference to their orders, but as assigned to the four monastic centres. They are:</p>
			<p>Ānandavāra attached to the Jyotirmaṭha;<br />Bhogavāra attached to the Govardhanamaṭha;<br />Bhūrivāra attached to the Śṛṅgerīmaṭha;<br />Kīṭavāra attached to the Śāradāmaṭha.</p>
			<p>These terms (though they appear to be a little fanciful) respectively indicate freedom from</p>
			<ol>
				<li>desire for sense-pleasures;</li>
				<li>desire for all enjoyments;</li>
				<li>desire for worldly possessions;</li>
				<li>tendencies hurtful to creatures.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each of these four monastic centres, again, has its own devatā and devī (tutelary deities), kṣetra (place of pilgrimage), tīrtha (holy river), gotra (spiritual lineage), Veda, svādhyāya (study of parti-cular Upaniṣads) and a mahāvākya (sentence for contemplation chosen from the Upaniṣads). The table given in page no. 467 gives all the details in a nutshell.</p>
			<p>In establishing the Daśanāmī order of monks, as attached to the four maṭhas, Śaṅkara showed remarkable social awareness also which was badly needed during his times. These maṭhas were charged with the task of caring for the welfare of the people of the regions assigned to them, through tours and discourses.</p>

			<p>Vedic sacrifices were very common during the early phase of Hinduism. Among the various yāgas or sacrifices, the Somayāgas were performed with the soma juice, the soma plant being a special kind of creeper. This creeper had to be crushed for extracting the juice and then filtered. The strainer was the daśāpavitra and the vessel into which the juice would get collected, the droṇakalaśa.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>The daśāpavitra was made of the wool cut from a living ram, the wool being white. The dimensions had to conform to the directions given in the Śrautasūtras.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Festivals and sacred days, which are the popular manifestations of any religion, are legion in Hinduism.</p>
			<p>One of the major festivals observed throughout India is the Dasarā festival. It is celebrated from the Āśvayuja śukla pratipad to the daśamī (the bright half of the month Āśvayuja or Āśvina, generally falling in September-October), for nine days (Navarātri, festival of nine nights) or ten days (dasarā = daśa + ahar = ten days). This festival takes many forms. In Bengal, Bihar and Orissa it is celebrated as the Durgāpūjā, worship of the Divine Mother Durgā, usually in a clay image. In Uttar Pradesh and some other northern States it is observed as Rāmalīlā, a re-enactment of the Rāma story.</p>
			<p>In Karnataka, it is a multifestival, comprising Sarasvatīpūjā on the saptamī, Durgāpūjā on the aṣṭamī and Āyudhapūjā (worship of weapons and implements) on the navamī days.</p>
			<p>The tenth day known as Vijaya-daśamī, again, is observed as the day for immersion of the Durgā images after the Durgāpūjā, wherever it is observed.</p>
			<p>Where Rāmalīlā is enacted, Vijaya-daśamī is celebrated as the day of victory of Rāma over Rāvaṇa, the demon-king.</p>
			<p>It is also the day on which kings used to start on expeditions of victory or conquests for expansion. Worship of the śamīvṛkṣa (<em>Prosopis spicigera</em>) and the royal weapons like the sword, as also the royal horse and the elephant were part of the Vijayadaśamī festival.</p>
			<p>As per the account of various foreign travellers like Abdur Razak (A. D. 1413-1482), Domingos Paes (A. D. 1520) and Fernao Nuniz (A. D. 1536), the Dasarā was being celebrated in all pomp and glory as a State festival with the king being given the prime place, in Vijayanagara, the capital of the Vijayanagara empire. After the fall of the empire, it was taken up by the kings of Mysore State, and celebrated in a grand manner. The celebrations are continued even now, though as a peoples&#x2019; festival.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;One [who could drive his] chariot [in] ten [directions]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Ancient Hindu mythology traces all the kings of Bharatavarṣa (India) to two primeval races: The Sūryavaṁśa and the Candravaṁśa. Since Ikṣvāku and Raghu were the most outstanding emperors of the Sūryavaṁśa, the race has also been known by their names as Ikṣvākuvaṁśa or Raghuvaṁśa. But, the very best of all the kings of this race was Rāma or Śrī Rāma, considered and worshipped as an incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu himself. Daśaratha was the father of this Rāma and the son of another great king of this lineage, Aja.</p>
			<p>Though the impression created by the <em>Ayodhyākāṇḍa</em> of the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> of Vālmīki is that Daśaratha was a weak king, a prisoner of his infatuation for his wife Kaikeyī and a doting father, he was actually a great hero and a good ruler in his younger days. The very word &#x2018;Daśaratha&#x2019; which means &#x2018;one who could drive his ratha or chariot in daśa or ten directions&#x2019;, is proof enough of his valour.</p>
			<p>He was the king of Kosala with its capital at Ayodhyā. He had three queens—Kausalyā, Sumitrā, and Kaikeyī—who were the daughters of the kings Bhānumanta, Śūrasena and Aśvapati Kekaya respectively. A cabinet of eight distinguished ministers, under the able guidance of Sumantra, assisted him in administration.</p>
			<p>He had a daughter called Śāntādevī, but no male issues, Śāntādevi had been adopted by the king Romapāda as his daughter and had been married to the sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga.</p>
			<p>On the advice of the royal preceptor Vasiṣṭha, Daśaratha performed the Putra-kāmeṣṭi sacrifice with Ṛṣyaśṛṅga as the head-priest and was blessed with four sons. Rāma (from Kausalyā), Bharata (from Kaikeyī), Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna (from Sumitrā).</p>
			<p>The four princes grew up into fine young men under the able tutelage of the highly competent sage Vasiṣṭha.</p>
			<p>Once, the sage Viśvāmitra arrived at the court of Daśaratha and requested him to send Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa with him to guard the sacrifice he was conducting, against the ruinous attacks of the demons Mārīca and Subāhu. Though Daśaratha was at first unwilling, he later on acceded to the request of the sage (on the intervention of Vasiṣṭha, who knew better) and sent his two sons.</p>
			<p>After some heroic exploits and excellent training in the arts of war and peace under Viśvāmitra, the youths arrived at the capital Mithilā of the king Janaka. When the Śivadhanus, the mythical bow of god Śiva, was broken by Rāma, to win the hand of princess Sītā, Janaka&#x2019;s daughter, Daśaratha arrived soon at Mithilā with his entourage and took part in the marriage of Rāma and Sītā, and also of the other three princes with suitable brides.</p>
			<p>As he was getting old, he decided to instal Rāma as the Yuvarāja (crown-prince). When the preparations were in an advanced stage, Kaikeyī, under the wicked spell of her malicious maid Mantharā, demanded the fulfilment of the two boons Daśaratha had given her long back. They were: making her son Bharata the king and banishing Rāma to the forest for fourteen years. Unable, either to change her mind or to accede to her demand, the mortally shocked Daśaratha passed away. Meanwhile Rāma, along with his wife Sītā and brother Lakṣmaṇa had already left for the forest as per Kaikeyī&#x2019;s words, conveying the &#x2018;order&#x2019; of the king and father Daśaratha.</p>
			<p>Daśaratha is said to have met this tragic end due to the curse of a sage-couple whose only son he had killed by mistake, long back, in his youth.</p>
			<p>As per the description of the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> Daśaratha was a good and noble king who had ruled his kingdom righteously.</p>

			<word>Daśarathajātaka</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Over the centuries, the story of <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> of Vālmīki, has given rise to many other literary works which are faithful adaptations of the original, or, are at variance with it. The <em>Daśarathajātaka</em>, numbered as 461 in the Jātaka Tales series, is one such, belonging to the latter group. In this jātaka, the main story of the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> has been retold in a startlingly distorted form.</p>
			<p>Daśaratha was the king of Vārāṇasī. Rāmapaṇḍita, Lakṣmaṇakumāra and Sītā-devī were his children by his chief queen. Bharatakumāra was the son of his second wife who became the chief queen after the death of the first. At her behest, to fulfil a boon he had promised earlier he was forced to exile the first three children for 14 years and hand over the kingdom to her son Bharatakumāra. Meanwhile he died. When Rāmapaṇḍita returned after the period of exile was over, he became the king.</p>
			<p>It is strange that the Jātaka tale narrates Rāma as having married Sītā who was his own sister!</p>
			<p>The view that the <em>Daśarathajātaka</em> must have been based on a much older Rāma story has been thoroughly discounted by scholars of repute, who have shown that the case may just be the reverse!</p>

			<word>daśatāla</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;ten spans&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hinduism allows the worship of icons or images of deities, not only as their symbolical representations but as the deities themselves, when imbued with their subtle presence through appropriate rites such as āvāhana (inviting) and prāṇapratiṣṭhā (infusing life).</p>
			<p>Such images which are generally installed in temples for public worship are to be prepared strictly according to the principles of mūrtiśilpaśāstra or icono-graphy. The basic unit of length used in the sculpturing of images is called &#x2018;tāla&#x2019; (or span). It is the measurement of the palm of the hand (from the tip of the middle finger to the wrist) and is equal to the length of the face (from the top of the forehead to the bottom of the chin). This tāla is again divided into 12 equal parts, each part being designated as &#x2018;aṅgula&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>While sculpturing the images, standards are prescribed, based on this tāla (and the aṅgulas). Hence this system is called the &#x2018;tālamāna&#x2019; paddhati or system.</p>
			<p>If an image is to be &#x2018;daśatāla,&#x2019; it simply means that the total height from the bottom of the feet (in the standing posture) to the top of the head should be ten tālas.</p>
			<p>The daśatāla measurement is divided into three varieties: uttama (superior), madhyama (middling) and adhama (inferior). The proportions are 124, 120, and 116 aṅgulas respectively.</p>
			<p>The daśatāla is the most preferred scale for making the images of the major deities and their female counter parts. It is prescribed for the icons that are worshiped for getting various benefits.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;ten incarnations [of Lord Viṣṇu]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>To ward off the extraordinary perils to which mankind is prone—may be the visitations from the demons, may be from the human malefactors—and to preserve the socio-ethical order, Lord Viṣṇu whose duty it is to preserve this world, often incarnates himself. Though such incarnations are popularly considered to be ten, there is no limit to their number. Nor are there any restrictions regarding the time and place of their appearance. Whenever dharma declines and adharma prospers he bodies himself forth to restore the balance in the world.</p>
			<p>In the Matsyāvatāra (Fish-incarnation), the Lord is said to have saved Manu (the progenitor of mankind) and the Saptarṣis (the seven sages, mind-born sons of Brahmā) along with their wives during the deluge. The world was repopulated through them later on.</p>
			<p>Lord Viṣṇu incarnated himself as the Kūrma (the Tortoise) in order to support the mount Mandara which started sinking during the churning of the ocean (samudra-mathana). The gods and demons had jointly undertaken this adventure to get amṛta (nectar) from the ocean.</p>
			<p>Next in the series is the Varāhāva-tāra (Boar-incarnation) in which the Lord killed the demon Hiraṇyākṣa and lifted the earth out of the flood waters in which it had been submerged. This may be a symbolic representation of the extrication of the world from the deluge of sin by the power of the Supreme Being.</p>
			<p>When Prahlāda, the great devotee of Viṣṇu was being severely tortured by his father, the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu, (who was a non-believer in the existence of an omnipresent and omnipotent God), Narasiṁha (Man-lion) appeared emerging out of the pillar shown by him and killed him. Being a combination of man (the best of higher creatures) and lion (the best of lower creatures) Narasiṁha represents the best of creations. Incidentally this also proves the omnipresence of God. Narasiṁha is especially the embodiment of valour which is a divine attribute and hence worshipped by rulers and warriors. His Mantra is said to be very powerful, capable of destroying enemies and exorcising evil.</p>
			<p>When Bali, the grandson of Prahlāda, conquered the three worlds, Indra was deprived of his heavenly kingdom. At the request of Aditi, the mother of Indra, Lord Viṣṇu incarnated as Vāmana (the Dwarf), a young brāhmaṇa boy, and approached Bali who was known for his munificence, for a gift of land that could be covered by three steps. With the first and the second he covered the earth and heaven, and with the third, he pushed down Bali to the netherworld. Hence he is also known as Trivikrama, one who encompassed the world with three big steps.</p>
			<p>This myth teaches us that since even God had to resort to the dwarf&#x2019;s form while begging, one who begs makes himself small! Secondly, a true brāhmaṇa can conquer the three worlds by the power of the spirit. These five avatāras have been referred to in the various sections of the Vedas.</p>
			<p>The next five incarnations are in the human form.</p>
			<p>Paraśurāma (Rāma with the battle-axe) is the sixth avatāra. Born as the son of the sage-couple, Jamadagni and Reṇukā, he exterminated the tyrannical among the Kṣattriyas led by Kārtavīrya, who were oppressing the people. Whether this story has any historical basis and represents the struggle for supremacy between the brāhmaṇas and kṣattriyas, it is difficult to say.</p>
			<p>Śrī Rāma, the next incarnation, met Paraśurāma and absorbed his power into himself. Hence the latter is sometimes considered as āveśāvatāra, an incarnation by the temporary possession of Viṣṇu&#x2019;s powers.</p>
			<p>Śrī Rāma, one of the two most popular incarnations of the Lord Viṣṇu, comes next in the series. His story is too well-known to need any repetition. He typifies the ideal man. His story, the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> has now become an immortal epic. His name is known as the &#x2018;tāraka-mantra,&#x2019; the mantra that takes one across the ocean of transmigration.</p>
			<p>Balarāma, Rāma, the strong, the elder brother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the eighth incarnation. His many adventures include the slaying of the ape Dvivida and the demon Dhenuka, shaking the ramparts of Hastināvati (the capital city of the Pāṇḍavas) and dragging the river Yamunā out of its course. The story that the serpent Śeṣa issued forth from his mouth at the time of his death gives credence to the belief that he was the incarnation of Śeṣa. Some scholars, basing their conjecture on the weapon of Balarāma (the hala or plough), opine that he was an agricultural hero raised to the status of an avatāra in course of time.</p>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the ninth incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu is, perhaps, the most popular, so much so, that he is considered Pūrṇāva-tāra (the incarnation <em>in toto</em>) and all other deities are regarded as his manifestations. His story and his exploits are too numerous and too well-known to be mentioned here. To the average Hindu, he is the supreme statesman, warrior, hero, philosopher and teacher, nay, God himself. He is the great expounder of the &#x2018;Song Celestial,&#x2019; the <em>Bhagavadgītā.</em></p>
			<p>The tenth avatāra Kalki, is yet to come. He will descend upon the earth at the end of the present age (Kali Yuga). Riding on the back of a white horse, with a drawn sword, he will destroy the enemies of dharma and re-establish it in all its glory.</p>
			<p>This list of the ten avatāras of Lord Viṣṇu is by no means the standard one accepted by all. Taking Śrī Kṛṣṇa as Viṣṇu Himself, he is not included in some lists. His place is taken over by Buddha. In some other lists, Buddha replaces Balarāma. Iconographically speaking, Buddha seems to have disappeared from such lists only after the 15th century.</p>
			<p>Strangely enough, the purpose of the Buddha-incarnation was to mislead men of low birth and genius, who had become too proficient in the sacred lore and were a threat to the supremacy of the gods! This looks more like a joke than a serious proposition. It is obvious that the Hindus sealed the fate of Buddhism in this country by absorbing Buddha into the pantheon of the avatāras.</p>
			<p>Haṁsa, Sātvata, Yajña, Dattātreya, Vedavyāsa are some of the avatāras included in other lists, keeping the total as ten only. The number, however, rises sometimes to as high as twentythree.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The words &#x2018;Ārya&#x2019; and &#x2018;Dasyu&#x2019; are found in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself (<em>vide</em> 1.34.7; 1.100.18; 1.51.8; 1.117.21). The word &#x2018;Dasyu&#x2019; has been used there in several senses such as: super-human enemies, human foes, aborigines and so on. Some of the words used to describe them give us the impression that they were flat-nosed, ugly and unclean persons who did not perform the sacrificial rites (of the Āryans), hated the gods and were addicted to strange practices.</p>
			<p>Cumuri, Śambara and Śuṣṇa are some of the names of the well-known Dasyus mentioned in the Vedas.</p>
			<p>They were probably primitive settlers of the regions conquered by the Āryans. Or, they might have been the renegades in the Āryan society who were cultural outcastes. In later literature the word refers to criminals committing atrocities on peace-loving people.</p>
			<p>Indra, the lord of the gods, is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;dasyuhatya&#x2019; (one who destroys the Dasyus).</p>
			<p>The Iranian terms &#x2018;daṅhu&#x2019; and &#x2018;daqyn&#x2019; are similar to the word &#x2018;Dasyu&#x2019; and indicate a country inhabited by hostile people.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;[a son] given to oneself [by others]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The ancient sages of India gave as much importance to life in the next world (pitṛloka, the world of manes) as to the life here. Hence they always hankered after an aurasaputra or a son born out of the wife married as per the rules given in the dharmaśāstras. It was this son (or sons) who had the right to the property of his father and also perform the śrāddha ceremony after his death. (See <ref>ŚRĀDDHA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>If a person had no children from his wife, he was permitted to adopt a son who was called &#x2018;dattaka.&#x2019; In course of time elaborate rules were framed for the process of adoption.</p>
			<p>Every male Hindu who is a major and of a sound mind can adopt a son, if he himself has no son or grandson or near (male) relative, who is eligible to perform the śrāddha after his death. The boy to be adopted must be from the same caste.</p>
			<p>The primary right to give a son for adoption rests with the natural father. The mother can also do so provided she gets the consent of her husband or is a widow.</p>
			<p>Persons having more than one son only can give a son for adoption by others. They should not, however give the eldest son.</p>
			<p>If there is only one son, he should not be given away in adoption. However, even this has been sometimes allowed on the condition that the boy should be considered as the son of both the natural father and adopting father. In such cases, the adopted boy is called &#x2018;dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The procedure of adoption given in the dharmaśāstras has several steps. The more important ones are: fasting by the adopter the previous day, offering madhuparka (See <ref>MADHUPARKA</ref> for details.) to the officiating priest, performance of the dattahoma using Ṛgvedic verses, holding both hands of the boy symbolic of receiving him into ones own family and offering of boiled rice.</p>
			<p>By such an adoption, the boy now becomes like an aurasaputra or natural son, enjoying all the rights and privileges and also bound to discharge all the duties and responsibilities.</p>
			<p>If a natural son is born to the adopter later on, then the dattaka gets only one-fourth share in the property.</p>
			<p>Though adoption was confined mostly to boys, girls too could be adopted. The two famous examples in our epics are those of Śāntā the adopted daughter of Romapāda and Kuntī, of Kuntibhoja.</p>

			<word>Dattātreya</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;One [who was] given to Atri&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hindu mythology abounds in stories of Lord Viṣṇu&#x2019;s avatāras or incarnations which may be pūrṇāvatāras (full manifestations) like Śrīkṛṣṇa or aṁśāvatāras (partial manifestations) like Kapila or even āveśāvatāras (temporary infilling of the divine power) like Paraśurāma. Dattātreya is regarded as an aṁśāvatāra.</p>
			<p>He was the son of the sage Atri and Anasūyā, one of the paragons of wifely virtues and chastity in the mythological lore. According to one of the accounts, Atri who was childless, performed severe austerities to please God and obtain a worthy son. All the three deities of the Hindu Trinity—Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva—appeared before him and granted his desire by being born through their aspects, as three sons: Brahmā as Candra, Viṣṇu as Datta and Śiva as Dūrvāsas.</p>
			<p>According to another version, the three who came to test the chastity of Anasūyā were transformed into a child with three heads and six arms! This is how Dattātreya was born.</p>
			<p>Dattātreya also called &#x2018;Datta&#x2019;—has been described as a great sage, counted among the saptarṣis or seven sages in the Svārociṣa-manvantara. (See <ref>MANVANTARAS</ref>.) He was the originator of certain magical rites and the creator of the soma plant. Sometimes pictured as a teacher of non-Āryan races he has been described as ritually impure. However, his powers of knowledge and enlightenment are so great that no impurity can ever taint him.</p>
			<p>The great king Kārttavīryārjuna was a disciple of his.</p>
			<p>A cult designated as the Datta-sampradāya has grown round him. It still prevails in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Nepal. His temples are generally called &#x2018;Dattamandira&#x2019; and it is his wooden sandals that are normally installed and worshipped. His temples are at Māhūr (Maharashtra) Gāṇagāpura (Karnataka) and Wāḍi (Maharashtra). There is an old shrine on one of the peaks of the Girnar Hill in Gujarat.</p>
			<p>The sect of the Mahānubhāvas, started by Cakradhara (A. D. 1263) in Maharashtra considers Dattātreya as a perfect manifestation of the Godhead.</p>
			<p>Iconographically Dattātreya may be shown with three heads and six hands, holding the emblems of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva such as kamaṇḍalu (water pot), śaṅkha (conch), cakra (discus) and triśūla (trident). A bull (vṛṣabha, representing dharma or righteousness) is shown as his mount. Sometimes, four dogs (representing the four Vedas) are also shown as his constant companions.</p>
			<p>The well-known treatise of Advaita Vedānta, the <em>Avadhūtagītā</em>, has been attributed to his authorship.</p>
			<p>The Dattātreya concept may be an attempt at harmonising the three cults of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. It may also have been the medium through which non-Vedic cults were brought into the Hindu fold.</p>

			<p>This is a minor Upaniṣad belonging to the cult of Viṣṇu and classed among the ones of the <em>Atharvaṇaveda.</em> There are three khaṇḍas or sections and a total of nine long mantras, all in prose, except one.</p>
			<p>The four-faced Brahmā once approached Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Lord of the universe in the Satyakṣetra—the region situated between the rivers Gaṅgā and Yamunā—and requested him to teach that transcendental wisdom by which one can become free from the rounds of birth and death. Nārāyaṇa advised him to meditate upon his Abode of pure sattva (the quality of substance of purity and effulgence). Those who meditate thus and realise that the Lord is &#x2018;Datta,&#x2019; since he gives (datta = what is granted or given) the knowledge of Brahman, and also declare it to others, will never again be bound in saṁsāra or transmigratory existence.</p>
			<p>Having been instructed by Nārāyaṇa thus, Brahmā meditated upon the Dattātreya aspect of Nārāyaṇa and taught it as Sat (the eternal Truth) to others.</p>
			<p>Next, a series of mantras of Dattātreya are given, classifying them as ekākṣara (one-lettered), ṣaḍakṣara (six lettered) and so on.</p>
			<p>They are:</p>
			<p type="poem">(1) dām ||</p>
			<p type="poem">(2) Oṁ śrīṁ hrīṁ klīṁ glauṁ drām ||</p>
			<p type="poem">(3) drāṁ dattātreyāya namaḥ ||</p>
			<p type="poem">(4) Om āṁ hrīṁ krom ehi dattātreya svāhā ||</p>
			<p type="poem">(5) Om aiṁ kroṁ klīṁ klūṁ hrāṁ<br />hrīṁ hrūṁ sauḥ dattātreyāya svāhā ||</p>
			<p type="poem">(6) dattātreya hare kṛṣṇa<br />unmattānandadāyaka |<br />digambara mune bāla piśāca jñānasāgara ||</p>
			<p>The next section gives a very long mantra, called &#x2018;mālāmantra&#x2019;. It begins thus: &#x2018;Oṁ namo bhagavate dattātreyāya smaraṇamātra-santuṣṭaya....&#x2019; and so on. It ends with the words, &#x2018;Oṁ namaśśivāya ityupaniṣat.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>The third or the last section delineates the fruits of the practice of this esoteric science. The results he will get will be equal to that got by repeating the Gāyatrīmantra one lakh times or the Mahārudramantra one lakh times and so on. He purifies a hundred of his predecessors and a hundred of his descendants. He is never tainted even by the most heinous of sins like killing a cow. The knowledge of all mantras and yogas accrue to him of their own accord. In other words he becomes a jīvanmukta, one liberated even while living.</p>

			<p>Full control over one&#x2019;s own mind is a virtue that we often hanker for. Patañjali (200 B. C.) the great master of Yoga, had dealt with this topic from two standpoints. In the negative aspect, one should try constantly to avoid or overcome the various obstacles that disturb our mental balance or concentration. In the positive aspect, repeated efforts should be made to tackle the mind directly and control it.</p>
			<p>Patañjali in his <em>Yogasūtras</em> lists nine major obstacles—which he calls &#x2018;antarāyas&#x2019;—and five minor ones (<em>vide</em> 1.30, 31) to the control of mind. &#x2018;Daurmanasya&#x2019; is listed as the second in the list of minor impediments. Literally it means &#x2018;being in a bad state of mind&#x2019; (dur = bad, manas = mind). In effect, it refers to the frustration one gets when one&#x2019;s desires are unfulfilled or thwarted.</p>
			<p>It is neither possible nor desirable to fulfil all our cravings and ambitions. Hence we should take recourse to discrimination and be convinced that desire is the root-cause of all our troubles. Once the intensity of desire is lessened, the shock of disappointment also will be lessened. If and when it is completely eliminated, the problem is permanently solved.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Showing dayā or compassion to all the living creatures and not harming them has been a basic moral discipline enjoined on all, in Hinduism.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;dayā&#x2019; has been defined in various ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The desire that arises in one&#x2019;s heart to mitigate the sufferings of others by putting forth the necessary effort.</li>
				<li>The desire to do good to others even as one wishes that others should do towards oneself.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <em>Devībhāgavatam</em> (1.15.60) des-cribes Dayā as one of the eight female companions accompanying the Devī (Divine Mother).</p>
			<p>The word is also used as an appellation for Lakṣmī, the consort of Viṣṇu, since she is the very personification of compassion towards all the living beings who are her children.</p>
			<p>Vedānta Deśika (A. D. 1268-1370), the celebrated teacher of the Rāmānuja school, has composed an exquisitely moving hymn called <em>Dayāśatakam</em> on Lakṣmī as Dayā.</p>

			<p>The dharmaśāstras are the law-books guiding the Hindu society over the centuries. They contain enough material regarding civil as well as criminal topics.</p>
			<p>The smṛtis (secondary scriptures), nibandhas (digests) and purāṇas (mythological works) are the main components of these dharmaśāstras.</p>
			<p>One of the topics that has been discussed in great detail in these works is that of division of ancestral property and the rules for inheritance. On the whole, there has been a broad twofold system prevailing in the country, for nearly a thousand years.</p>
			<p>They are: the Mitākṣarā school and the Dāyabhāga school.</p>
			<p>The <em>Mitākṣarā</em> or <em>Ṛjumitākṣarā</em> is a magnificent commentary by Vijñaneśvara (12th cent. A. D.) on the ancient work, <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em>. The <em>Dāyabhāga</em> is an independent work, a digest, written by Jīmūtavāhana (A. D. 1100). It has a standard commentary called <em>Dāyatattva</em> by Raghunandana (A. D. 1510-1580).</p>
			<p>The two schools depend almost entirely on these works.</p>
			<p>The Mitākṣarā school is the authority accepted all over India except in Bengal (including Bangladesh). However the Dāyabhāga school seems to be a binding authority in Bengal.</p>
			<p>According to the Mitākṣarā law, a son, as soon as he was born, became a coparcener (joint owner) with his father in the ancestral property inherited by him. But in the Dāyabhāga system the son did not automatically acquire that right just by birth.</p>
			<p>The father, during his life-time, could alienate the property or give it to his children or prepare a will according to his desire. None had the right to question it. If the person passed away without issues, his widow became the owner of that property and not his brothers or other relatives.</p>

			<word>Dayānanda Sarasvatī, Svāmī</word>
			<note>(A. D. 1825-1883)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The growth and development of any religion and culture depend to a great extent on the freedom of thought and action, that its votaries enjoy. If Hindu religion and culture have survived the onslaughts of time and change, it is not a little due to this freedom and the reform movements that it engenders. One of the effective and largely successful reform movements of the 19th century is the Āryasamāj Movement. Svamī Dayānanda Sarasvatī was its founder.</p>
			<p>He was born in A. D. 1825, in the small town of Ṭaṅkāra in the Morvi district of Gujarat as the son of Ambāśaṅkar Tivārī and Amṛtābāī. His original name was Mūlaśaṅkara. Being born in an orthodox brāhmaṇa family, he underwent the usual religious sacraments like upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread) and Vedic studies as also performing religious rites.</p>
			<p>The free movement of a little rat on the Śivaliṅga on a Śivarātri day, became the turning point in his life and in his attitude towards image worship as also ritualistic religion. He developed a great abhorrence for the same.</p>
			<p>The death of his uncle and a sister made him more introvert and philosophical. One day, when preparations for his marriage were going on, he managed to slip away from his house, never to return again.</p>
			<p>He started travelling from place to place, in search of a competent guru or spiritual teacher. After studying some Vedāntic texts under Svāmī Brahmānanda and Paramahaṁsa Paramānanda, he was ordained into saṁnyāsa or monastic life by one Svāmī Pūrṇānanda Sarasvatī.</p>
			<p>From then onwards he came to be known as Svāmī Dayānanda Sarasvatī.</p>
			<p>It was actually Svāmī Virajānanda Sarasvatī, a blind but erudite and a highly evolved soul, that fulfilled the spiritual aspirations of Dayānanda. After intensive study and training under Him for about three years, Dayānanda set out on his life&#x2019;s mission as per the directions of his guru Virajānanda.</p>
			<p>Propagation of the pure Vedic religion based entirely on the Saṁhitās was the main task assigned to him by his guru.</p>
			<p>Now began his relentless fight against the various unhealthy accretions to the Vedic religion as also the assaults on Hinduism by the Semitic religions. He prepared himself for this onerous task by practising severe austerities for two years in a garden in Agra.</p>
			<p>During his ceaseless travels all over the country he mercilessly shattered, through his incisive logic and vast know-ledge of the Vedas, the various opinions and practices of the pundits. He successfully roused the religious conscience of the masses. He also reconverted many people who had gone out of the Hindu fold and even gave them the Gāyatrī-mantra, which he considered as a universal mantra and the common property of all the Hindus.</p>
			<p>His insistence on the original Vedic religion as true Hinduism, his call to ignore the caste system as a man-made accretion and his stress on the varṇa system based, not on birth, but on character, earned him a very large following, especially from the deprived sections of the society.</p>
			<p>However, his ruthless condemnation of many ritualistic and other practices in the Hindu society based on the secondary scriptures like the purāṇas, created many enemies for him. His criticism of Islam and Christianity as also his campaign for reconversion of those who had left Hindu religion roused the wrath of the Muslims and the Christians. Several attempts were made against his life.</p>
			<p>Dayānanda established the Ārya Samāj at Bombay in 1875 with a creed of 28 principles which he later reduced to 10 in the revision he himself made, in 1877. (See <ref>ĀRYASAMĀJ</ref> for details.) He passed away in 1883 being poisoned by his own cook, whom he forgave and helped to escape!</p>
			<p>By his pure life, fearless and uncompromising adherence to the principles of his conviction, crusades against the forays into the Vedic religion by others and scholarly works like the <em>Satyārthaprakāśa </em>(in Hindi) as also Sanskrit commentaries on some portions of the Vedas, Dayānanda has carved out a permanent place for himself in Hinduism.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the doctrine [that the] body [itself is] the self &#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Indian philosophical systems have been broadly divided into two streams: the āstika and the nāstika. The former accept the Vedas as the final authority whereas the latter do not. One of the three systems of the latter group is the Cārvāka system. Its founder is said to be one Cārvāka or the reputed sage Bṛhaspati.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Cārvāka&#x2019; might have been derived from its etymology as &#x2018;one who speaks sweetly&#x2019; (cāru = sweet, vāk = speech) or as &#x2018;one who preaches the doctrine of &#x201c;eat drink and be merry&#x201d; (carv = to eat)&#x2019;. In other words it stands for Indian materialism.</p>
			<p>According to this system, there is no permanent abiding ātman or soul different from and beyond the deha or the physical body. The deha (body) itself is the ātman (the soul). The very fact that we say, &#x2018;I am stout,&#x2019; &#x2018;I am lean,&#x2019; &#x2018;I am sick&#x2019; and so on, shows that we are, in reality, the body.</p>
			<p>There is of course consciousness in a living body. But this is a product of the elements of matter like earth and water even as fermentation of certain articles develops the power of intoxication.</p>
			<p>The survival of man after death in any form, is unseen and unproved.</p>
			<p>Hence make the best of this world even while living here and do not bother about the hereafter.</p>
			<p>This is the gist of this school of materialism.</p>

			<word>Deoghar</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;the house of God&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Deoghar—corrupted form of Devagṛha (&#x2018;house of God&#x2019;)—is a town situated in the Santhal Parganas of the Jharkhand State. It is famous for its temple of Vaidyanātha or Baidyanāth (Śiva), one of the twelve Jyotirliṅgas (See <ref>JYOTIRLIṄGAS</ref>.). Other names by which it was known are: Harītakīvana, Ketakīvana, Rāvaṇavana, Citābhūmi and Hārdapīṭha. Probably it was a forest of trees of inknuts (harītakī) or fragrant screwpine flowers (ketakī).</p>
			<p>According to the local legends, when Rāvaṇa got the Śivaliṅga from Śiva Himself to be taken to Laṅkā, the gods contrived to get it fixed to the ground on the way itself. This place has now become the present Vaidyanātha.</p>
			<p>This is also the place where the hṛdaya or the heart of Satī&#x2019;s body (cut by Viṣṇu, by his discus) is said to have fallen. Hence the name Hārdapīṭha (seat of the heart of Satī), one of the 52 Śaktipīṭhas (places of Śakti or the Divine Mother).</p>
			<p>The temple of Vaidyanātha Śiva is a simple structure with a pyramidal tower 26.5 metres (72 feet) in height. It faces east. The liṅga is cylindrical in form. It is 10 cms (4 inches) high. The diameter is 12.7 cms. (5 inches). The top of the liṅga is uneven.</p>
			<p>There are different porches, some containing pillars and hanging bells.</p>
			<p>Near the main entrance there is a well called Candrakūpa (&#x2018;well of Candra or the Moon&#x2019;). It is said to contain the essence of all the holy rivers and lakes.</p>
			<p>A little away is the Śivagaṅgā—a large tank measuring 270 metres by 180 metres (900 feet by 600 feet)—with an embankment. It is also called Mānas-sarovar.</p>
			<p>The rituals followed in the temple are very simple, like bathing the liṅga with water, smearing with sandal paste and offering bilva leaves as also flowers.</p>
			<p>There are pilgrims who bring water from the Gaṅgā near Badarīnāth or even the Mānas-sarovar (in Tibet) just to bathe this liṅga.</p>
			<p>Persons suffering from serious ailments or with unfulfilled desires observe certain simple vows as lying on the bare ground and drinking the holy water with which the liṅga has been bathed. They observe it for three days. The redemption is believed to come with revelations during a dream.</p>
			<p>There are eleven other shrines in the courtyard of the temple dedicated to deities like Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, Pārvatī, Kālī, Gaṇeśa, Sarasvatī, Rāma and others.</p>
			<p>If the present temple of Vaidyanātha was renovated or rebuilt in A. D. 1596 by one Pūraṇ Mal, the others have come up during the period A. D. 1630 to 1813, built by several others.</p>

			<word>devadāsīs</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;servant-maids of God&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Human beings have a strong tendency to cast their gods also in their own mould. The things we like and love to possess or enjoy here must be dear to God too and hence he should not be deprived of them! This appears to be the logic behind the devadāsī system.</p>
			<p>Dedicating grown-up girls to the service of God in temples and places of worship seems to have been an ancient practice. It existed in Babylonia, Cyprus, Phoenicia, Greece, Mesopotamea, Syria and Arabia, as also some countries of the South-East.</p>
			<p>When exactly this custom began in India, is difficult to say. According to some sociologists, it might have started in the 3rd century A. D., though in the image of a female dancer discovered at Mohenjo Dāro (2500 B. C.) some archaeologists &#x2018;see&#x2019; a devadāsī.</p>
			<p>The custom might have existed throughout India, but much more in the South than in the North.</p>
			<p>Those who were dedicated to the god in a temple were often married ceremonially to the image. Thereafter they were to serve that god devotedly.</p>
			<p>The duties of a devadāsī were, in general, as follows: Keeping the temple precincts clean and neat; preparing flower garlands and other decorative materials for the deity; music and dancing, as a part of the temple rituals and so on.</p>
			<p>They were expected to be adepts in music and dancing. Hence they were specially trained in this art.</p>
			<p>A lady could become a devadāsī in several ways. Seven such ways have been mentioned in the relevant works. They are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>(1)  dattā—</dt>
				<dd>One who has offered herself to a temple.</dd>
				<dt>(2)  vikrītā—</dt>
				<dd>One who has sold herself to a temple.</dd>
				<dt>(3)  bhṛtyā—</dt>
				<dd>One who has given herself to the temple for the upkeep of her family.</dd>
				<dt>(4)  bhaktā—</dt>
				<dd>One who has chosen to become a devadāsī out of devotion to the Lord.</dd>
				<dt>(5)  hṛtā—</dt>
				<dd>One who has been abducted and offered to a temple.</dd>
				<dt>(6)  alaṅkārā—</dt>
				<dd>One who was offered to a temple by a king or his minister as per some tradition.</dd>
				<dt>rudragaṇikā or gopikā—</dt>
				<dd>One appointed for singing and dancing in a temple as a profession.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>In some of the edicts found in Karnataka, the service to a god in a temple has been classified into two kinds: aṅga-bhoga and raṅgabhoga. The former consists of direct services to the image like bath, anointing with sandal paste, burning of incense and waving of lights, offering flowers and food articles and so on. The latter comprises mainly music and dancing by the devadāsīs.</p>
			<p>Enough provision used to be made for their maintenance by the kings or the society through grant of lands, money and materials.</p>
			<p>They were also given a place of honour in the society.</p>
			<p>Whatever might have bean the original intentions behind this system—noble or devotional—it soon degenerated into prostitution with a &#x2018;divine&#x2019; sanction. It also gave rise to exploitation of the weaker sex in the name of religion.</p>
			<p>Though several serious attempts have been made to eradicate it through punishments to the agents or reformation of the devadāsīs themselves, the success achieved has not been commensurate with the efforts.</p>
			<p>Remnants of the custom continue to exist even today in some parts of Karnataka (jogiti tradition in the Ellamma temple at Saundatti, Belgaum district), Goa, Maharashtra (where the devadāsīs are called &#x2018;bhāvins&#x2019;) and Tamil Nadu.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>In imitation of the well-known <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, a number of other Gītās have appeared in the later religious literature of Hinduism. One of them is the <em>Kapilagītā</em> from the Bhāgavatam (3.25-33). Here, the great sage Kapila, reputed to be an incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu, teaches Sāṅkhya or spiritual wisdom, to his own mother Devahūti.</p>
			<p>Devahūti was the second of the three daughters of Svāyambhuva Manu. She was married to the sage Kardama and gave birth to nine daughters including Arundhatī (wife of the sage Vasiṣṭha) and Anasūyā (the paragon of wifely virtues and the wife of the great sage Atri) and a son, Kapila.</p>
			<p>Kapila was Viṣṇu himself born as their son. When Kardama left for the forest to lead a life of retirement and austerities, he advised Devahūti to approach their divine son for spiritual knowledge. Accordingly Kapila taught her Sāṅkhyaśāstra. After teaching her, Kapila too departed for the forest.</p>
			<p>Then Devahūti performed a sacrifice on the banks of the Sarasvatī river and did severe austerities. She thus realized the Truth and gave up the body.</p>

			<p>One of the several epithets of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is &#x2018;Devakīnandana,&#x2019; &#x2018;One who gives joy to Devakī&#x2019;. Devakī was his mother and Vasudeva, the father.</p>
			<p>Devakī was one of the seven daughters of King Devaka of the race of Yadus. She and Vasudeva were Pṛśni and Sutapā in a previous life. They had performed severe penance and had asked the boon from Viṣṇu that he should be born as their son in a future incarnation.</p>
			<p>After marriage to Vasudeva, when the tyrant Kaṁsa, her cousin, was taking the couple out in a chariot driven by himself, a voice from the void predicted that her eighth child would kill him. This enraged Kaṁsa so much that he tried to kill her then and there. Her life was saved on the intervention of Vasudeva who promised to hand over all the children born of her. Kaṁsa imprisoned the couple and killed all the six babies born to them one after another. The seventh baby was mysteriously transferred to the womb of Rohiṇī, the elder wife of Vasudeva. He was Balarāma, the elder brother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The eighth child was Śrī Kṛṣṇa who later on killed Kaṁsa, to the great relief of all.</p>
			<p>After the exit of Śrī Kṛṣṇa from the world and the death of Vasudeva, Devakī along with Rohiṇī, gave up her body in the funeral fire (in sahagamana).</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Sages—known as ṛṣis and munis—were always held in high esteem in ancient India. The fact that Arjuna, the principal hero of the Mahābhārata war, mentions the name of Asita-devala (&#x2018;Devala, the dark one&#x2019;) among the great sages (<em>vide</em> <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> 10.13), shows that Devala was an ancient and highly respected sage. Devala has been described in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> (<em>Ādiparva</em> 67) as the son of Pratyūṣa who was one of the eight Vasus. (See <ref>AṢṬAVASUS</ref>.) He was a brahmarṣi (the highest status accorded to a sage in the scriptures). Dhaumya, another ṛṣi, who was the chief priest of the Pāṇḍavas, was his brother.</p>
			<p>He is said to have been present at the Sarpayāga (snake-sacrifice) conducted by the king Janamejaya (the son of Parīkṣit, grandson of the Pāṇḍava hero Arjuna).</p>
			<p>In the dharmaśāstra literature, mention is often made of the <em>Dharmasūtra</em> of Devala. He has been profusely quoted by other, later, writers. Even Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) mentions his name. The work itself, however, has not been traced till now. Even if all that is quoted from his work by other writers is collected, edited and published, it will prove to be a valuable addition to the extant dharma-śāstra works.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Hindu scriptures have been broadly divided into two groups: Śruti and smṛti.</p>
			<p>The Vedas including the Upaniṣads are the Śruti. All other secondary works like itihāsas, purāṇas, smṛtis of Manu and others, as also dharmaśāstras, are clubbed together under the omnibus term &#x2018;smṛti&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Since the Vedas deal only with the spiritual and otherworldly matters, gradually, a vast class of a special literature dealing more explicitly with the life here and now, both at the individual and at the social level, developed. This came to be known as &#x2018;dharmaśāstras&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>If some of the more ancient books among the dharmasāstras like the smṛtis of Manu and Yājñavalkya or the dharma-sūtras of Āpastamba or Baudhāyana did pioneering work in the field, later writers put forth a commendable effort in preparing compilations and digests culling the relevant topics from the earlier canonical literature.</p>
			<p>One such well-known digest is the <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> of Devaṇṇbhaṭṭa, who was also known by other names such as Devaṇṇa-bhaṭṭopādhyāya, Devaṇa, Devā-nanda and Devagaṇa. He was the son of Keśava-bhaṭṭopādhyāya and might have existed in the 12th century A. D.</p>
			<p>The <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> is an extensive digest and its author claims that he has only collected in one place the opinions of various authorities, adding nothing of his own. He quotes profusely from several sources and earlier authors. He refers to Vijñāneśvara (author of <em>Mitākṣarā</em> on the <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em>) with great respect though he differs from him on several points.</p>
			<p>The contents of the work may be briefly summarised as follows: Various saṁskāras or sacraments; duties of brahmacārins (Vedic students) and gṛhasthas (house-holders); daily duties such as sandhyā, śrauta and smārta rites; procedure of law-courts, partnership rules; dāyabhāga (See <ref>DĀYABHĀGA</ref>.); details about śrāddha and so on.</p>
			<p>Some other writers too—like Śukadevamiśra and Āpadeva—have named their works as <em>Smṛticandrikā</em>, but they are not so well-known.</p>
			<p>Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa is said to have written another work, on music and dancing, called <em>Saṅgītamuktāvalī.</em></p>

			<p>He was the eldest son of the king Pratīpa of Candravaṁśa (the Lunar dynasty) by his queen Sunandā.</p>
			<p>Though he succeeded his father to the kingdom, he was forced to abdicate by the people in favour of Śantanu, since he became afflicted with leprosy. (Incidentally, this shows the power that the people of a country exerted on the royal house even in the ancient days.) Devāpi then took saṁnyāsa (monastic orders) and started living independently.</p>
			<p>During Śantanu&#x2019;s rule, the country faced a severe famine. Then Śantanu went to Devāpi, offered his apology and requested for his blessings. Soon afterwards, there were heavy rains and people were saved from the calamity of starvation.</p>
			<p>Devāpi is also the name of another person, a kṣattriya by birth, who attained brāhmaṇahood through tapas or austerity.</p>
			<p>The king of the Cedi country who fought on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas in the Kurukṣetra war and was killed by Karṇa was also known as Devāpi.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Throughout the history of mankind, human beings have been seeking—whether they know it or not—unalloyed happiness or bliss. Freedom from suffering and attainment of eternal peace and joy, have been the universally acclaimed goals of life.</p>
			<p>From times immemorial, a firm belief in the existence of a Supernatural Being, omniscient and omnipotent, seems to have been ingrained in the very nature of man. By somehow establishing a contact with this Being, often called &#x2018;God&#x2019;, one can get whatever one wants in life. This is the conviction resulting from this belief.</p>
			<p>Hinduism proclaims that this God is both nirākāra and nirguṇa (without any particular form or attributes) as also sākāra and saguṇa (capable of assuming any form and attributes at will). He can also manifest himself as a personality without any particular form, but with all the blessed qualities that one can imagine. Nothing prevents him, if need be, from assuming any form that a votary devotedly hankers for seeing or even incarnate here in the human form to set right the mess we create!</p>
			<p>An illustration can make this point more clear. Water can exist in three states: ice, liquid water and water vapour or steam. Water vapour has no particular form whereas ice has. But liquid water can assume the shape of the vessel into which it is poured. In all these three states, vastu or substance is one and the same, though nāma (nomenclature) and rūpa (form) are different. Similar is the case with God.</p>
			<p>Though Hinduism concedes that the gaining of freedom from all suffering and attainment of eternal bliss, are possible by adopting any one of the four well-known yogas (paths of spiritual disciplines)—Jñānayoga, Bhaktiyoga, Rājayoga and Karmayoga—Bhaktiyoga or the path of bhakti (devotion to God in his sākāra saguṇa aspect) is, comparatively speaking, much easier in this age, characterised as it is, by an excessive attachment to the physical body and (consequently) to physical comforts.</p>
			<p>Once this is acknowledged, the necessity for and the role of rituals in this path of bhakti can easily be recognised and appreciated.</p>
			<h3>Necessity of Rituals</h3>
			<p>By the word &#x2018;rituals,&#x2019; certain religious observances and practices performed in a systematic way as per the directions given in the scriptures are meant. Pūjā (worship of God or a deity), sandhyopāsanā (meditation on God as the light of knowledge and wisdom at dawn and dusk), homa (offering of oblations unto a deity in a duly consecrated fire), upavāsa (ceremonial fasting) and jāgaraṇa (keeping vigil at night as a part of spiritual discipline)—all these are rituals.</p>
			<p>The philosophical truths contained in the Vedas, Upaniṣads and other similar scriptural works are, very often, too recondite to comprehend. Apart from an incisive intellect, purity of mind resulting from a pure sinless life is necessary to understand them. Performance of rituals is one of the easier means to achieve this purity of mind. However they should be done meticulously with a proper knowledge of the spirit behind them.</p>
			<h3>Need for Icons</h3>
			<p>A great majority of human beings are incapable of even conceiving—let alone contemplate upon—God as the Supreme Power or Intelligence without any particular name or form. This is because of the limitation imposed by the body-mind complex and the consequent identification with it. However, an icon—an image or a picture or even a symbol—can definitely help in this process of contemplation, even as a limited window in our room gives us a view of the unlimited sky as long as we are sitting in it.</p>
			<p>If the symbolical meaning and signi-ficance of the icon is understood properly, the icon itself will become an actualised form of the ideal. Then, viewing it will be almost as good as viewing the original it represents. It is akin to remembering a person when we look at his photograph.</p>
			<p>We may also look at it in another way. An abacus is needed (and used) to teach certain fundamental concepts of arithmetic, to little children. Similarly an icon, especially the one installed in a temple, along with the associated ideas, can help us to conceive of and contemplate on God.</p>
			<p>Icons or concrete symbols have played a prominent part in all religions.</p>
			<h3>Image Worship</h3>
			<p>Worship of images, both at home and in temples, as well as in public places of worship is widespread and popular in Hinduism. There is a mistaken notion that this is pure and simple idolatry. When in idolatry, the physical symbol itself is revered as God, in image worship, the reverence is offered to God in and through the image.</p>
			<p>Preparation of images of deities, worship to the deities through them, either in one&#x2019;s own personal or in family shrines or even in temples seems to be an ancient custom. Reference to images is found even in the Vedas (<em>vide</em> <em>Ṛgveda</em> 4.24.10). Worship of deities through images is explicitly referred to in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> (<em>Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa</em> 20.14, 15) and <em>Mahābhārata</em> (<em>Ādiparva</em> 70.49; <em>Anuśāsanaparva</em> 10.20, 21).</p>
			<p>Often, the images are replaced by symbolical objects such as śivaliṅgas, śālagrāmas and yantras, and worshipped.</p>
			<h3>External and Internal Worship</h3>
			<p>Worship of God can be either internal or external. Internal worship called &#x2018;mānasapūjā&#x2019; is actually meditation which may be a simple process of contemplation on the form of the deity or may involve a regular ritualistic worship with all the ingredients, but all done mentally.</p>
			<p>External worship is the worship of the deity in an image or a symbol with all the necessary articles needed for the worship as per the religious works.</p>
			<p>When the external worship is performed properly in the right spirit, over a period of time, it may lead to greater and greater introversion. As a result, external, formal, worship may drop off by itself. Then, only internal worship or meditation can be continued.</p>
			<h3>The Conception of Arcāvatāra</h3>
			<p>Some schools of devotion have put forward the theory that God descends (= avatāra) into the image at the time of worship (= arcā) in a subtle form when invited through appropriate mantras. It is something like putting on the switch to make the electric current flow through a lamp and give light.</p>
			<p>By the same logic, when an image fixed in a temple, is consecrated as per the prescribed procedure (in which prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā or infusing with life, is an important aspect), the deity &#x2018;lives&#x2019; in that image permanently, in a divine or subtle form.</p>
			<p>Hence the worshipper has to be extraordinarily careful while performing the ritualistic worship to such consecrated images.</p>
			<h3>Pūjā or Worship</h3>
			<p>Now, the various steps involved in an actual pūjā or worship may be described.</p>
			<p>Since external cleanliness and neatness are conducive to internal purity, the first thing to be done before starting pūjā is to clean the pūjā-room and the surrounding area thoroughly. Of course, it goes without saying, that the worshipper should take bath and wear washed and clean clothes for the pūjā. It may be a good custom even to keep two sets of clothes to be worn (by turns) only at the time of ritualistic worship.</p>
			<p>After arranging all the vessels and materials needed for the pūjā properly, the worshipper should sit on the pūjā-seat (which should be used only for the purposes of pūjā) in such a way that he is facing the deity or keeping the deity to his left.</p>
			<p>Generally, facing east or north is preferred and facing south is forbidden.</p>
			<p>The whole rite of pūjā—for that matter, any religious or ritualistic act—should begin with ācamana or ceremonial sipping of water with certain mantras.</p>
			<p>This should be followed by saṅkalpa or religious resolve. Apart from the details of that particular day according to the Hindu calendar (followed in the tradition of the worshipper&#x2019;s family), the saṅkalpa-mantra also contains some other statements such as the destruction of one&#x2019;s sins, acquisition of religious merit and some other particulars connected with the mode of worship.</p>
			<p>Then come some purificatory processes like āsanaśuddhi (ritual sanctification of the seat), bhūtāpasāraṇa (driving away the evil spirits), puṣpaśuddhi (ritual cleansing of flowers, bilva and tulasī leaves) and agniprākāracintā (erecting a wall of fire through imagination) and so on.</p>
			<p>The next steps are prāṇāyāma (breath control in aid of peace and concentration) as also bhūtaśuddhi or creating a spiritual body in place of the physical one.</p>
			<p>Prāṇapratiṣṭhā (filling the spiritual body with the presence of the deity), nyāsas (ritual purification of limbs) and mudrās (postures of fingers and hands) follow next.</p>
			<p>Now, are taken up the most important parts of the worship—dhyāna (meditation on the deity in one&#x2019;s heart and transferring the same into the image or symbol) and upacāras (modes of direct service).</p>
			<p>These upacāras can be 5 or 10 or 16. Sometimes they are raised to 64 or even 108! But, normally, the first two are common for daily worship and 16 upacāras for special worship. The other two are done only in temples on very special occasions.</p>
			<p>These upacāras are ceremonially offered with appropriate mantras to the deity invoked into the image or symbol.</p>
			<p>The ten upacāras are: pādya (water for washing the feet), arghya (water for washing the hands), ācamanīya (water for rinsing the mouth), snānīya (giving a bath by pouring water over the image or the symbol with Vedic mantras), gandha (applying fresh sandal paste), puṣpa (offering of flowers, bilva and tulasī leaves), dhūpa (waving of lighted incense sticks), dīpa (waving of a lighted lamp), naivedya (giving food-offering as also drinking water) and punarācamanīya (giving water for rinsing the mouth at the end).</p>
			<p>At the end of the worship, puṣpāñjali (offering of a handful of flowers) is laid at the feet of the deity, indicating the conclusion of the whole ritual.</p>
			<p>Where the pūjā is done to the deity in a temporarily invoked image (as in the worship of clay icons of Gaṇapati or Durgā), udvāsanā or visarjana also has to be done. It is the ceremonial withdrawal of the deity from the image, back into one&#x2019;s own heart, after which the image or the symbol (like a flower) can be disposed off.</p>
			<p>The mode of worship described so far, is according to the tāntric tradition. The Vedic tradition is slightly different from this. A brief account of the same is as follows:</p>
			<p>Dīpajvalana (lighting the lamp and praying to it as the symbol of the deity and requesting it to burn steadily till the pūjā is over), ācamana, guruvandana (obeisance to one&#x2019;s own guru or spiritual teacher), prayer to Vighneśvara or Gaṇapati (for the removal of obstacles to the pūjā), ghaṇṭānāda (ringing the bell with appropriate mantras to drive away the demons and welcome the gods) (Ringing the bell is necessary at other times also as during ceremonial bath to the deity and offering incense etc.), recitation of two Vedic mantras to steady the mind (<em>Ṛgveda</em> 10.63.3 and 4.50.6), maṇṭapadhyāna (meditation on the miniature shrine structure, generally made of wood), āsanamantra (for purification and steadiness of the seat), prāṇāyāma, saṅkalpa, ceremonial purification of the water in the kalaśa (water vessel) to make it fit for using in pūjā, filling up the śaṅkha (conch) with that water and inviting its presiding deities (like Sūrya, Varuṇa, Candra and others) to reside in it in a subtle form, sprinkling that water over all the articles of pūjā to consecrate them, nyāsa with the <em>Puruṣasūkta</em> (<em>Ṛgveda</em> 10.7.90), invoking the presence of the deity into the image and offering the upacāras.</p>
			<p>The sixteen upacāras offered are: āvāhana, āsana, pādya, arghya, ācama-nīya, snāna, vastra (cloth) as also upavīta (sacred thread, called &#x2018;yajñopavīta&#x2019;), gandha, puṣpa, dhūpa, dīpa, naivedya, tāmbūla (betel leaf and nut), recitation of the <em>Mantrapuṣpa</em> (<em>Taittirīya Āraṇyaka</em>—<em> Aruṇapraśna</em> 78 to 84), pradakṣiṇa (circumambulation) and namaskāra (obeisance).</p>
			<p>Some more, traditional and interesting, aspects of this worship may now be stated.</p>
			<p>In the pañcāyatanapūjā (pūjā to the five standard deities viz., Śiva, Devī, Viṣṇu, Gaṇeśa and Sūrya), one&#x2019;s own family deity should be kept in the centre and the other four around it in the prescribed order.</p>
			<p>Abhiṣeka (pouring water for giving bath to the image) is to be done with gośṛṅga (horn of a cow) to the śivaliṅga and with śaṅkha to Viṣṇu or śālagrāma.</p>
			<p>While offering cloth in pūjā, different types of cloth are offered to different deities, which can be known from the concerned scriptural injunctions. In the routine daily pūjā even flowers can be offered in place of cloth, as a substitute.</p>
			<p>Dhūpa is offered to the feet and dīpa before the face of the deity. In general ārati (waving of lights), the dīpa has to be waved all over the deity&#x2019;s image.</p>
			<p>Pradakṣiṇā is to be done three times in the clockwise direction, slowly, with folded hands. Then comes sāṣṭāṅga-praṇāma, done by lying down on the chest, on the floor.</p>
			<p>At the end, tīrtha (the consecrated water of the pūjā) and prasāda (consecrated food offering) should be received by all who have taken part in the pūjā or witnessed it.</p>
			<h3>Epilogue</h3>
			<p>What has been described till now, just gives an idea of the philosophy and the spirit behind the Hindu ritualistic worship.</p>
			<p>The Hindu scriptures themselves consider these rituals as the kindergarten of religion. When understood properly and performed meticulously, they lead to inner purity and concentration. When this concentration becomes deep, the external rituals drop off by themselves. Till then, they must be performed.</p>

			<p>Sages of knowledge and wisdom (ṛṣis) as also of austerity (munis, tapasvīs) have been well-known in the Hindu scriptural works.</p>
			<p>Among the several kinds of ṛṣis mentioned there, the devarṣis are one group.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;devarṣi&#x2019; has been defined as a &#x2018;sage who is like a god&#x2019; or as &#x2018;one who is revered even by the gods&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The most well-known of all the devarṣis is Nārada. The others are: Atri, Bhṛgu, Kutsa, Vasiṣṭha, Gautama, Kaśyapa and Aṅgiras. In other lists the names of Tumburu, Bharata, Parvata and Devala appear. There seems to be no unanimity in the classified lists.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Derived from the root &#x2018;div&#x2019; (= to shine) the word &#x2018;deva&#x2019; represents the divine beings inhabiting the heavenly regions. They are described as the sons of the sage Kaśyapa from his first wife Aditi. Hence they are also known as ādityas or āditeyas.</p>
			<p>In the Vedic literature their number is often stated as 33. The break-up is: 8 Vasus, 11 Rudras, 12 Ādityas, Indra and Prajāpati. (See under each title for details.)</p>
			<p>But again, they are all the manifestations of the one Supreme God.</p>
			<p>In the mythological literature—Vedic and post-Vedic—the devas are pictured as constantly in conflict with the asuras (antigods or demoniac beings). The asuras are probably of two types: the daityas and the dānavas. They were the sons of Diti and Danu who too were the wives of Kaśyapa.</p>
			<p>Indra was the king of the devas and Virocana, of asuras.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Devasenā and Daityasenā were the daughters of Dakṣaprajāpati and hence sisters. Once they were abducted by a demon called Keśin, but were rescued by Indra. When Ṣaṇmukha or Subrahmaṇya (also known as Kārttikeya) led the army of the gods against Padmāsura and Tārakāsura and killed them, Indra was so pleased that he gave Devasenā in marriage to him. Bṛhaspati is said to have performed the religious rites of the marriage. According to this story, the well-known festival day, Skandaṣaṣṭhī or Subrahmaṇya ṣaṣṭhī, is this day of marriage.</p>
			<p>Etymologically, the word could just mean &#x2018;the army of the gods&#x2019;. Since Ṣaṇmukha led that army as its chief he was called &#x2018;Devasenāpati&#x2019; (pati = lord, master). Since the word &#x2018;Devasenā&#x2019; is in the feminine gender, the story that &#x2018;she&#x2019; was a princess and he was her husband could have been invented and later interpolated into the purāṇas.</p>

			<word>devatās</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;divine beings&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Etymologically speaking, the words &#x2018;devatā&#x2019; and &#x2018;deva&#x2019; mean the same thing. The devatās are gods or deities or divine beings endowed with extraordinary or supernatural powers.</p>
			<p>In the Vedic literature, especially in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, we come across a number of devatās. They are usually enumerated as 33. (See <ref>DEVAS</ref> for details.) Apart from these gods, many inanimate objects like grinding stone, qualities like faith, emotions like anger, aspects of nature like dawn have been deified and described. There are quite a few female devatās also though they are not as prominent as the male deities.</p>
			<p>These deities may have an anthro-pomorphic form or may not have. As an aspect of nature or a physical object they don&#x2019;t. But, as the presiding deity behind them they do have.</p>
			<p>The Vedic deities have been allotted different places in the universe. Agni, Pṛthvī and Somapavamāna belong to the pṛthvī (earth). Indra, Vāyu and Parjanya belong to antarikṣa (sky). Varuṇa, Mitra, Sūrya and Viṣṇu belong to dyuloka (heaven).</p>
			<p>But, ultimately, all of them are different aspects of the Supreme God, Brahman-Ātman.</p>
			<p>Sometimes these devatās are described as being born from one another. For instance Agni is born from Sūrya and again, Sūrya from Agni. Being too remote in point of time, it is rather difficult for us to explain these anomalies. Sometimes, even the explanations of the <em>Nirukta</em> by Yāska do not help us much.</p>
			<p>The paurāṇic Hinduism has offered a large number of devatās, gods and goddesses, most of whom do not seem to have existed during the Vedic period. However, the basic idea that all of them are different aspects of one and the same Supreme God (Brahman or Paramātman) persists.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>&#x2018;Devavrata&#x2019; was the original name of Bhīṣma, the famous grandsire of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>. See <ref>BHĪṢMA</ref> for details.</p>
			<p>According to the <em>Padmapurāṇa</em> (<em>Pātālakhaṇḍa</em>, 73) Devavrata was a brāhmaṇa who was born as a bamboo stem in the Vṛndāvana where Kṛṣṇa lived, since he had incurred the wrath of the devotee of Viṣṇu and had been cursed by him. When Kṛṣṇa cut it, made a flute out of it and started playing on it, Devavrata was liberated.</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Devavrata&#x2019; is also the name of a vrata or religious observance mentioned in some of the purāṇas. Worshipping Maheśvara (Śiva) on a caturdaśī day (14th day after full-moon or new-moon) with the star Maghā (comprising alpha, eta, gamma, zeta and two more stars) and the planet Guru (Jupiter) in conjunction, will bestow long life, wealth and fame. This is one vrata called &#x2018;Devavrata&#x2019;. In another type, nakta (eating once only at night) for eight days and gifting a golden trident and discus as also two garments is the discipline prescribed. Result promised is freedom from even grave sins.</p>

			<p>An awareness of one&#x2019;s social respons-ibilities and earnest attempts to repay one&#x2019;s debts to the concerned persons gradually evolved into the principle of ṛṇatraya (three debts) even at birth. The same was expanded in scope into an allied principle of pañcayajñas. They apply to all human beings, especially to the gṛhasthas or house-holders.</p>
			<p>Deva-ṛṇa or the debt towards the gods like Indra and Varuṇa has to be paid back by devayajña (also spelt as daiva-yajña) or offering of oblations ceremonially into the duly consecrated fire. Being pleased by (and also sustained by) such sacrificial offerings, these gods who have control over the elemental forces like rain or the growth of crops or granting worthy progeny, fulfil our desires. By thus mutually co-operating with each other both these gods and the human beings can live happily and even prosper well.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Birth and death have always proved to be a deep mystery for mankind. Every religion has tried to solve this in its own way. The solution Hinduism offers is found in the Vedic literature—the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, the <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> and some of the Upaniṣads like the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> and the <em>Chāndogya.</em></p>
			<p>The religion of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, the earliest available record of human civilisation, is not only optimistic but also dynamic. A life lived well here, in accordance with the principles of ṛta (straightforwardness), satya (truth) and dharma (righteousness), will automatically give you happiness and peace in the life hereafter also. This is the main teaching of the Vedas, the Upaniṣads and all the allied scriptures.</p>
			<p>A strong belief in an uncreated, unborn eternal soul, born out of their mystical experiences, naturally made the Vedic seers reflect on its sojourn after the death of this body also. What they discovered in their moments of revelation was given expression to in some of the mantras.</p>
			<p>Generally, three destinies for the soul of a dead person have been predicated in these Vedic works: going to the Brahma-loka (or the world of Brahmā) by the Arcirādimārga (the path of light, also called Devayāna or Uttarāyaṇa), from which there is no return to this mundane existence; going to the Pitṛloka or Candra-loka (the world of manes) by the Dhūmādi-mārga (the path of smoke) from which there is return after exhausting the fruits of the merit acquired earlier in this world; repeated birth and death in various bodies.</p>
			<p>The first mention of the words Devayāna and Pitṛyāna is found in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> where Agni is addressed as the knower of the path of gods (1.72.7) and the path of the manes (10.2.7). In the mantra (10.18.1) Mṛtyu, the god of death, is requested to clear away from the path of gods. The <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> also mentions these paths in several places. The Ṛgvedic verse (10.18.1) is repeated almost verbatim in the <em>Atharvaveda</em> (12.2.21).</p>
			<p>It is quite likely that the Devayāna and the Pitṛyāna were the celestial paths by which the gods (like Indra) and the manes used to descend to this earth to receive their sacrificial and obsequial offerings and return. Gradually, however the paths were &#x2018;thrown open&#x2019; as it were, to deserving human beings too.</p>
			<p>The Devayāna starts with arcis or the light of the funeral pyre and ends with the Brahmaloka. Various stations are mentioned in between. The enumeration of these stations is found in the following Upaniṣads: <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> (6.2.15 and 16); <em>Chāndogya</em> (4.15.5 and 5.10.1 to 6); <em>Kauṣītaki-brāhmaṇa</em> (1.3). It is mentioned in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (8.24) also. The stations commonly mentioned are:</p>
			<p>Arcis (light), ahaḥ (day), āpūrya-māṇapakṣa (bright fortnight), uttarāyaṇa (summer solstice), saṁvatsara (year), āditya (sun) and candramas (moon).</p>
			<p>At this point, an &#x2018;amānavapuruṣa&#x2019; (a being who is not a human; a divine being) will come and take the soul to Brahmā in Brahmaloka or Satyaloka.</p>
			<p>Sometimes &#x2018;candramas&#x2019; is omitted and &#x2018;devaloka&#x2019; is substituted for &#x2018;saṁ-vatsara&#x2019;. The divine being had also been called &#x2018;puruṣo mānasaḥ&#x2019; (&#x2018;the mind-born person&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>The terms used in these lists such as arcis (light) or ahaḥ (day) actually refer to the ātivāhikās or divine guides on the path (<em>vide Brahmasūtras</em> 4.3.4).</p>
			<p>Who are those fortunate persons considered as fit enough to tread this path and go to Brahmaloka, from which there is no return? The <em>Chāndogya</em> (5.10.1) and the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> (6.2.15) Upaniṣads declare that the knowers of the <em>Pañcāgni-vidyā</em> (&#x2018;the doctrine of five fires&#x2019;) (See <ref>PAÑCĀGNIVIDYĀ</ref>.) as also those who live in the forests, devoted to faith, austerity and truth, go by this path. The <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</em> too (1.2.11) mentions that those who are self-controlled, full of knowledge and wisdom, living on alms and in forests and devoted to austerity, go by the &#x2018;Sūryadvāra&#x2019; (i.e., Devayāna) and attain the Immortal Being. The <em>Praśna Upaniṣad</em> (1.10) also proclaims the same thing.</p>
			<p>Those who reach the Brahmaloka are supposed to live there enjoying great peace and bliss till the end of Brahmā&#x2019;s life, after which they—along with the Brahma-loka and Brahmā—get merged in Parabrahman or the Supreme Spirit.</p>
			<p>This mode of mukti or liberation is called kramamukti or gradual liberation.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Ever since the elaborate rituals to consecrated images in temples became an established tradition, each temple too started having its own special celebrations. Such celebrations are called &#x2018;yātrā&#x2019; or &#x2018;utsava&#x2019; or &#x2018;yātrotsava&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>There are some general rules guiding such festivals, especially regarding the auspicious days on which they should be done. The following table gives an idea of the same:</p>
			<p>All gods—, Pūrṇimā (full-moon day)</p>
			<p>Durgā—, Navamī (ninth day after full-moon or new-moon day)</p>
			<p>Lakṣmī—, Pañcamī (fifth day after full-moon or new-moon day)</p>
			<p>Śiva—, Aṣṭamī or Caturdaśī (eighth day after full-moon or new-moon day) (fourteenth day after full-moon or new-moon day)</p>
			<p>Skanda (Ṣaṇmukha)—, Ṣaṣṭhī (sixth day after full-moon or new-moon day)</p>
			<p>Vināyaka (Gaṇapati)—, Caturthī (fourth day after full-moon or new-moon day)</p>
			<p>Of course, local customs can differ and other days may be chosen for the temple festivals.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the shining one&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The &#x2018;devī&#x2019; is the feminine counterpart of &#x2018;deva&#x2019; and hence means a goddess.</p>
			<p>The concept as well as the worship of God as the Mother of the universe—deification into a feminine form, of the Supreme Power ruling over the universe—is as old as the human civilisation. The people of Assyria and Babylonia worshipped the goddess Ishtar, as the goddess <em>par excellence</em>.</p>
			<p>There is enough evidence to believe that Mother-worship existed during the Indus valley Civilisation (2800 B. C.).</p>
			<p>The <em>Ṛgveda</em> (2.1.11; 8.10.2) refers to several female deities as the consorts of male deities or even as independent and separate goddesses such as Aditi, Uṣas, Pṛthvī, Rātri, Vāc, Śraddhā and so on. Sacred rivers like Sarasvatī, Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Śutudrū and Paruṣṇī were also deified as goddesses.</p>
			<p>In course of time, many folk-goddesses of great antiquity and uncertain origin were also absorbed into the Devī-cult.</p>
			<p>However, it is in the paurāṇic age that the notion of the Mother-goddess, Devī, came to be associated with the three prominent deities (the Trimūrtis) Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva, thereby giving rise to a great number of her aspects.</p>
			<p>The three major goddesses are Sarasvatī (consort of Brahmā), Lakṣmī (consort of Viṣṇu) and Pārvatī (consort of Śiva).</p>
			<p>In the purāṇas, while there is an attempt to depict them as three aspects of one and the same Devī, there are also legends trying to project one of them as superior to and hence the mistress of, the other two.</p>
			<p>By and large, an overwhelming majority of the goddesses are either different facets of the goddess Pārvatī (the spouse of Śiva) or her attendants or her associates. In fact, even the word &#x2018;Devī&#x2019; has been specially reserved for her.</p>

			<word>Devībhāgavata</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The purāṇas or Hindu mythological lore, have been classed among the secondary scriptures of Hinduism. Yet, modern Hindu religious practices are, for the most part, dependent on them.</p>
			<p>The great antiquity of the core content of the purāṇas, known as <em>Purānāsaṁhitā</em>, is, by now, well-established. Over the centuries, it gave rise to the eighteen Mahāpurāṇas as we know them today. Its derivatives include the eighteen Upapurāṇas (minor works) also. The <em>Devībhāgavata</em> is one of the more well-known and fairly popular purāṇas.</p>
			<p>Whether the <em>Devībhāgavata</em> is a Mahāpurāṇa or only an Upapurāṇa, has been a contentious issue. If the Vaiṣṇavas (followers of the Viṣṇu cult) argue that the <em>Bhāgavata</em> in the list of Mahāpurāṇas is the <em>Viṣṇubhāgavata</em>, the Śāktas (followers of the cult of Śakti or the Divine Mother) vehemently assert that it is the <em>Devībhāgavata</em> that is meant. Since controversies lead to unnecessary and undesirable conflicts, and obstruct the process of spiritual evolution, it is better to ignore them.</p>
			<p>Some scholars opine that a śākta brāhmaṇa of Vārāṇasī (or Kāśī) might have composed it during the 11th or the 12th century.</p>
			<p>However, the text follows the general pattern of the other purāṇas.</p>
			<p>King Janamejaya (son of the well-known king Parīkṣit and grandson of Arjuna, the famous Pāṇḍava hero) incurred great sin for having massacred innumerable serpents in his Sarpayāga (Serpent-sacrifice, akin to a black-magical rite). He had performed it to avenge the death of his father by the bite of Takṣaka, the king of reptiles.</p>
			<p>To ward off the effects of this sin the sage Vyāsa taught him this <em>Devī-bhāgavata</em>.</p>
			<p>As the very name indicates, the main content of the work is the story of the exploits of the Devī (Mother Divine). It is almost identical with—though in greater detail—the story as delineated in the more well-known, but much shorter, work, the <em>Devīmāhātmya</em>.</p>
			<p>There are 12 skandhas or Books, the number of adhyāyas (Chapters) and ślokas (couplets or verses) being 318 and 18,457 respectively.</p>
			<p>A brief synopsis of the contents may now be given here, to get an idea of this work:</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 1</em> (chs. 20; śls. 1184)</h1>
			<p>Stories of Śuka, Hayagrīva, Madhu and Kaiṭabha and Brahmā&#x2019;s prayer to the Devī find a prominent place in this book.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 2</em> (chs. 12; śls. 723)</h1>
			<p>Stories of Vyāsa, Śantanu, Bhīṣma and the Pāṇḍavas are delineated here.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 3</em> (chs. 30; śls. 1746)</h1>
			<p>Story of the king Sudarśana of Kāśī who was a great devotee of the Devī and at whose request the Devī stayed back there as also details of the Durgāpūjā, known as Śaran-navarātri-vrata, the origin of which goes back to Śrī Rāma&#x2019;s first worship as per the advice of the sage Nārada find a prominent place in this section.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 4 </em>(chs. 25; śls. 1416)</h1>
			<p>Doctrine of Karma, stories of Nara-Nārāyaṇa and of Kṛṣṇa are the main contents of this skandha.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 5</em> (chs. 35; śls. 2094)</h1>
			<p>This skandha contains the entire story of the <em>Devīmāhātmya</em> (also known as <em>Durgāsaptaśatī</em> and <em>Caṇḍī</em>) but in greater detail. The story of Mahiṣāsura&#x2019;s birth and of his falling in love with the Devī before being obliged to fight with her and be killed, is an additional feature. The rest of the story is the same as in the other work.</p>
			<p>(See <ref>DEVĪMĀHĀTMYA</ref> for the details of the story.)</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 6</em> (chs. 31; śls. 1888)</h1>
			<p>Stories of Vṛtrāsura, Nahuṣa, Śunśśepha as also of Nārada&#x2019;s being deluded by the power of all-bewitching māyā of Lord Viṣṇu are the main themes dealt with here.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 7 </em>(chs. 40; śls. 2245)</h1>
			<p>Apart from stories and legends of the princess Sukanyā and her husband, the sage Cyavana, of Triśaṅku, Hariścandra and Viśvāmitra, this skandha gives many details of the various aspects of the Devī like Śākambharī and Gaurī. Some miscellaneous topics like Yoga, Bhaktiyoga, temples of Devī and her worship have also been dealt with.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 8</em> (chs. 24; śls. 834)</h1>
			<p>The special feature of this section is a detailed description of world geography, of Bhāratavarṣa (India), some astronomical factors as also a description of hells.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 9</em> (chs. 50; śls. 3617)</h1>
			<p>By far, this is the biggest of all the skandhas of this work. The well-known and popular story of Sāvitrī, other less known legends like that of Mahālakṣmī and Maṅgalacaṇḍī find a place here. Several mantras and procedures for meditation on some aspects of Devī like Rādhā, Durgā and Manasā are also given here.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 10</em> (chs. 13; śls. 508)</h1>
			<p>The story of <em>Devīmāhātmya</em> given in greater detail in the 5th skandha has been repeated here, though in a condensed form.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 11 </em>(chs. 24; śls. 1239)</h1>
			<p>This skandha is devoted entirely to sadācāra and pūjā, various ritualistic items connected with the daily routine of a religious person. Rules of good conduct, personal cleanliness, details of the rudrākṣa beads, some vratas or religious observances and vows, the sandhyā ritual, special worship processes, ritual repetition of the famous Gāyatrīmantra as also the details connected with the preparation and wearing of bhasma or vibhūti (sacred ash, dear to Śiva) are delineated in this section.</p>
			<h1><em>Skandha 12 </em>(chs. 14; śls. 963)</h1>
			<p>This small book gives some details regarding the Gāyatrīmantra and dīkṣā (initiation into spiritual life). It concludes with a description of the Ambāyajña (sacrifice conducted to please the Devī) performed by the king Janamejaya.</p>
			<p>On the whole, one has to concede, that this purāṇa successfully propagates the cult of the Devī or the Divine Mother and has given a lot of additional information useful to the spiritual aspirants.</p>

			<word>Devīgītā</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> of the <em>Mahā-bhārata</em> has become so well-known and so highly respected as a basic scripture by itself that several <em>Gītās</em> in imitation of the same have been composed in later times. Some of them are parts of other bigger works like the <em>Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Bhāgavata</em> (<em>vide Rāmagītā</em>, <em>Kapilagītā</em> and <em>Bhikṣugītā</em>) while others like the <em>Aṣṭāvakragītā</em> and the <em>Avadhūtagītā</em> are independent works. The <em>Devīgītā</em> belongs to the second category.</p>
			<p>It is in the form of a dialogue in 9 chapters between the Devī Pārvatī (as the teacher) and her father Himavān (as the disciple). She teaches the advaita doctrine as expounded by Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820). Advaitic experience can be obtained only by meditation on the Upaniṣadic texts like <em>tat tvam asi</em>. Such meditation becomes possible only to those who have a strong and pure mind. This, again, can be obtained only by the proper performance of one&#x2019;s duties as per one&#x2019;s varṇa (caste) and āśrama (station in life).</p>
			<p>Other subjects dealt with are: Viśvarūpa (universal form) of the Devī; aṣṭāṅga yoga or the eight steps of Yoga as taught by Patañjali (200 B. C.); other yogas viz., those of jñāna, karma and bhakti; temples of Devī and her worship (both Vedic and tāntrik) and so on.</p>
			<p>Obviously it is a later work of the Devī-cult.</p>

			<word>Devīmāhātmya</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;the greatness of the Devī [or the Goddess]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Devī-cult is centred round the concept and the worship of God as the Divine Mother. The <em>Devīmāhātmya</em> as also the <em>Devībhāgavata</em> are the two most important works of this cult.</p>
			<p>The roots of this cult can be traced to the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself. The <em>Ambhṛṇīsūkta</em> (10.125.1) and the <em>Rātrīsūkta</em> (10.127.1) are pointers to this. Some of the minor Upaniṣads like the <em>Devī Upaniṣad</em> as also the tantras (Śāktāgamas) have expounded this cult in greater detail.</p>
			<p>Gradually, as the paurāṇic religion became more popular, three aspects of the Devī—Sarasvatī, Lakṣmī and Pārvatī—were projected by the scriptures for worship and meditation. However, it is Pārvatī who has been almost exclusively meant by the word &#x2018;Devī&#x2019; and the innumerable goddesses considered as <em>her</em> aspects.</p>
			<p>The <em>Devīmāhātmya</em> is considered as a part of the <em>Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa</em> (chapters 78 to 90), though it is more likely to be an independent work, grafted on to this purāṇa later. It is also known by two more names: <em>Durgāsaptaśatī</em> (since it contains saptaśata or 700 verses extolling the greatness of Mother Durgā) and Caṇḍī (since it deals with the exploits of the fierce goddess Caṇḍī or Caṇḍikā).</p>
			<p>The work has thirteen adhyāyas or chapters divided into three Caritras or major sections as follows:</p>
			<p><em>Prathamacaritra</em>: Chapter 1.<br /><em>Madhyamacaritra</em>: Chapter 2, 3, and 4.<br /><em>Uttamacaritra</em>: Chapter 5 to 13.</p>
			<p>These three Caritras are devoted to the exposition of the greatness of the three aspects of the Devī, viz., Mahākālī, Mahā-lakṣmī and Mahāsarasvatī, in that order.</p>
			<p>The first section starts with the story of a king, Suratha by name, and the merchant Samādhi, both of whom had been deprived of their wealth and possessions by their own near and dear ones. They met at the hermitage of the sage Sumedhas, to where they had come, seeking peace. After hearing from each other about the tragedies that had struck them, they approached the sage Sumedhas, with the question as to why they were still mentally attached to their possessions and their relatives even though the latter had deliberately wronged them.</p>
			<p>In his long reply the sage described this blind attachment and infatuation as the direct result of the power of moha or māyā, the spell cast by the Devī or the Divine Mother on all the living beings. When their curiosity to know more was roused, the sage started describing in detail, the stories related to her.</p>
			<p>The first story concerns the Devī as Yoganidrā. At the end of a kalpa (cycle of creation) Nārāyaṇa was in deep sleep. Using this opportunity, two demons Madhu and Kaiṭabha—tried to attack and kill Brahmā (the creator, seated on the navel-lotus of Nārāyaṇa). Brahmā prayed to Yoganidrā (an aspect of Kālī), to come out of Nārāyaṇa so that he could wake up. She obliged, appeared before him and then disappeared. Nārāyaṇa then killed the demons and rescued Brahmā. With this ends the <em>Prathamacaritra</em> or the first section.</p>
			<p>The second section known as the <em>Madhyamacaritra</em> contains the story of Mahiṣāsura, the king of the asuras or demons. He had usurped the kingdom of heaven and driven away all the devas or gods including Indra. Then these gods under the leadership of Brahmā came to Viṣṇu and Śiva and recounted their tale of woe. As the two gods got angry, and a brilliant light emerged from their faces, the energies of all the others too emerged similarly out of them, merging into one huge mass of brilliant blazing light and power, which took the form of the goddess Durgā. As all the gods equipped her with their respective weapons, she went to Mahiṣāsura, challenged him for fight and ultimately killed him. The heavenly region was restored to the gods. The Devī Durgā promised to come to the rescue of the gods whenever they called upon her for help. Thus ends the second section.</p>
			<p>The last section called <em>Uttamacaritra</em> (or <em>Tṛtīyacaritra</em>) begins with the outrageous misdeeds of the demon brothers, Śumbha and Niśumbha, who too, like Mahiṣāsura, had forcibly occupied the heavenly regions and driven away the gods. Remembering the promise given by the Devī, the gods prayed to her. She manifested herself as Kauśikī Durgā, of bewitching beauty and started roaming about the Himālayan region. She was noticed by two servants of Śumbha who informed him about her presence in &#x2018;his kingdom,&#x2019; stressing, on her captivating beauty. When Śumbha sent messengers to her with a proposal for marriage, she informed them about her vow, taken out of &#x2018;ignorance,&#x2019; to marry only him who will conquer her in combat! All attempts by Śumbha&#x2019;s men, including several generals of his armed forces, to capture her, dead or alive, ended in total disaster. The Devī, with her emanations like Brahmāṇī, Nārāyaṇī, Kaumārī and others, successfully killed all the demons like Caṇḍa, Muṇḍa and Raktabīja. Finally, after withdrawing them into herself, she despatched both Niśumbha and Śumbha, to the world of Yama, the god of death, thereby ridding the world, of a great terror.</p>
			<p>After listening to these exploits of the Devī and learning from the sage Sumedhas the methods of worshipping her to get her grace, Suratha and Samādhi practised severe austerities for three years.</p>
			<p>They got her vision and obtained, through her grace, what they wanted. Suratha got back his kingdom whereas Samādhi succeeded in attaining supreme knowledge for which alone he had hankered.</p>
			<p>The work contains four hymns which are exquisitely beautiful and are a signal contribution to the hymnal literature.<br />They are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>(1) Brahmā&#x2019;s hymn to Yoganidrā—</dt>
				<dd>Ch. 1, śls. 72-87.</dd>
				<dt>(2) Hymn by all the gods, led by Indra, expressing their gratefulness after Mahiṣāsura was killed by Durgā—</dt>
				<dd>Ch. 4, śls. 1-27.</dd>
				<p>This hymn is known as <em>Indrādistuti</em>.</p>
				<dt>(3) Hymn by all the gods, on the bank of the river Gaṅgā in the Himālayas—</dt>
				<dd>Ch. 5, śls. 8-82.</dd>
				<p>This hymn is called <em>Aparājitāstotra.</em></p>
				<dt>(4) Hymn by all the gods, after Śumbha and Niśumbha were killed—</dt>
				<dd>Ch. 17, śls. 1-35.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This hymn is the famous <em>Nārāyaṇī-stuti.</em></p>
			<p>The entire <em>Devīmāhātmya</em> is considered as a <em>mantra</em>, endowed with mystical powers. That is why a ritual recitation of the same is encouraged, nay even recommended, for the fulfilment of one&#x2019;s desires.</p>
			<p>Such a ritual recitation normally consists of the following procedure:</p>
			<p>ācamana (ceremonial sipping of water before beginning any religious rite), prāṇā-yāma (breath-control), saṅkalpa (religious resolve stating the details of the ritual), dīpasthāpana (lighting a lamp and offering a simple worship to it, considering as a representation of the Devī), worship of the <em>Devīmāhātmya</em> book used for the ceremonial chanting, repetition of the śāpoddhāramantra to ward off the effects of the curses of the sages of yore, if any, and then the actual recital.</p>
			<p>The recital should include: <em>Kavaca-stotra, Argalāstotra, Kīlakastotra</em>, repetition of the well-known <em>Navārṇamantra</em> (which has to be received from a competent guru in initiation), recital of <em>Rātrisūkta</em>, the entire text of the <em>Devīmāhātmya,</em> the <em>Devīsūkta,</em> the <em>Rahasyatraya</em> (<em>Prādhānika</em>, <em>Vaikṛtika</em> and <em>Mūrti</em> Rahasyas), śāpoddhāramantra and kṣamāprārthanā (recital of the <em>Aparādhakṣamāpaṇastotra</em>).</p>
			<p>There are several modes of chanting for specific purposes like freedom from diseases, attaining wealth or position, for the birth of children and so on. These have to be learnt from teachers who are experts in the field.</p>
			<p>Recitations called <em>Śatacaṇḍī</em> (ten brāhmaṇas reciting it for four days—once on the first day, twice on the second day, thrice on the third day and four times on the fourth day) and <em>Sahasracaṇḍī</em> (with one hundred brāhmaṇas, the procedure being similar) are forms of congregational worship and are done for the welfare of the society.</p>
			<p>In all these rites, homa (offering of oblations into a duly consecrated fire) is also done.</p>
			<p>The <em>Devīmāhātmya</em> is highly revered even now and its recitation is quite popular.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The <em>Devīpurāṇa</em> is an Upapurāṇa, belonging to the cult of Śakti worship. The printed edition available now seems to be only a part of a much bigger original. It was probably composed in Bengal in the seventh century A. D.</p>
			<p>The book deals mainly with the exploits of the Devī, especially as Vindhya-vāsinī. However, many other topics also have been dealt with. They are:</p>
			<p>Various stories connected with Devī&#x2019;s incarnations; her relationship with Śiva and other gods; Śākta iconography and Śākta vows; some cults of Śiva, Viṣṇu and Gaṇapati; construction of towns and forts; different Vedic schools; the science of medicine; holy places; giving gifts; customs and usages of people and so on.</p>
			<p>The method of the worship of the Devī mentioned here is very different from that followed in present-day Bengal.</p>

			<word>Devīsūkta</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;hymn of the Devī or the goddess&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Worship of God as the Mother of the universe is a very ancient practice, especially in Hinduism. One of the oft-quoted authorities to prove this point is the <em>Devīsūkta</em> of the <em>Ṛgveda</em> (10.125.1-8).</p>
			<p>This sūkta or hymn is also known as the <em>Vāgāmbhṛṇīsūkta</em> since it was revealed to the woman ṛṣi Vāc who was the daughter of the sage Ambhṛṇa. It has eight mantras or stanzas wherein Vāc describes her mystical experiences and her identity with Paramātman or God.</p>
			<p>There are quite a few instances in the scriptural works wherein the sages who had attained mystical union with God had declared that they themselves were God (<em>vide Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> 1.4.10; <em>Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad</em> 3.1 and 2). Similar is the case here also.</p>
			<p>Commentators of the Viṣṇu cult identify her with Lakṣmī, the eternal consort of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa.</p>
			<p>The first verse declares that it is she (viz., Vāgāmbhṛṇī) that is moving in the form of the various Vedic deities like the eleven Rudras, the eight Vasus, the twelve Ādityas as also the Viśvedevas. It is she who is supporting and sustaining the gods Mitra, Varuṇa, Indra, Agni and the Aśvinīdevatās.</p>
			<p>Again, it is she who is sustaining the soma juice, and the gods Tvaṣṭā, Bhaga and Pūṣan. It is verily she who rewards a sacrificer when he performs it.</p>
			<p>She is the mistress of the whole world, awarding rewards to the worshippers. She is the primary deity propitiated in the vedic sacrifices. She exists everywhere.</p>
			<p>It is she who is responsible for all the psycho-physical activities in the living beings.</p>
			<p>Those who please her by proper acts of propitiation are elevated to the level of a ṛṣi (sage, a seer of mantras) or even Brahmā, the creator!</p>
			<p>It is she that strings the bow of Śiva when he decides to destroy the demons of the three cities (Tripurāsuras).</p>
			<p>She has created the svargaloka or heaven. She has also entered into all the worlds and all the beings. She it is, who is moving freely in the universe, even like the wind.</p>
			<p>Such is the greatness of the Devī.</p>
			<p>In spite of all the efforts of the various commentators, the purport of this hymn seems to remain rather elusive.</p>

			<word>Devī Upaniṣad</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a small Upaniṣad of only 32 mantras, assigned to the <em>Atharvaveda</em>. The mantras are both in prose and in verses. The Devī or God as the Divine Mother is the main theme. Verses included here seem to have been culled out from the <em>Devīsūkta</em> of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, the <em>Devī-māhātmya</em> of the <em>Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa</em> as also the <em>Durgāsūkta</em> of the <em>Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em>.</p>
			<p>Once all the gods approached the Devī (the Mother Divine) and asked her who she was. In reply she said she was Brahman and that the whole world comprising matter and souls, the five elements, the sacred and the secular sciences, the unborn and the born or in fact, all that exists every where, is herself. It is again she that exists in the form of the Rudras, the Vasus, and the Viśvedevas (various kinds of divine beings inhabiting the worlds). It is she that is helping Viṣṇu, Brahmā and others to sustain themselves. Due to her power and grace only, performers of Vedic sacrifices are able to reap their benefits.</p>
			<p>Hearing this, the gods praised her through a beautiful hymn: Obeisance to the auspicious goddess, the origin of the universe and the brilliantly shining deity. We take refuge in her, the goddess Durgā, Sarasvatī the mistress of speech, the consort of Śiva (as Dakṣa&#x2019;s daughter) and the power of Viṣṇu (Vaiṣṇavī). We bow down to her.</p>
			<p>The Upaniṣad then goes on to give the well-known Devīmantras like the pañcadaśākṣarī (<em>ka e ī la hrīm, ha sa ka ha la hrīm, sa ka la hrīm</em>) and the navākṣarī (<em>aiṁ hrīṁ klīṁ cāmuṇḍāyai vicce</em>).</p>
			<p>It concludes with a long list of the fruits one gets by the repetition of this Upaniṣad and the mantras therein.</p>

			<p>The word means an abode or a sacred place, a place of pilgrimage.</p>
			<p>The four well-known pilgrim centers—Badarīnātha in the north, Jagannātha-purī or Purī in the east, Rāmeśvara in the South and Dvārakā in the west—are specially known as &#x2018;Caturdhāmas&#x2019; (Cār Dhām in Hindī) and are coveted places of pilgrimage for all the Hindus.</p>
			<p>It is obvious that in the attempt at a visit to these centres, practically all the other important places of pilgrimage all over India too, are covered.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Some of the mystics of medieval India made serious attempts to weld the Hindus and the Muslims into one great brother-hood. Prāṇanātha was one of them. He must have lived during the period A. D. 1700-1750. He was an adept in the scriptures of both Hinduism and Islam. He founded a sect called the &#x2018;Dhāmī Sect,&#x2019; which was monotheistic in character and liberal in outlook.</p>
			<p>Members of this sect call God as &#x2018;dhāman or Home&#x2019;. Their religious life is founded on moral purity, compassion, service and love of humanity. In their places of worship, both Hindus and Muslims pray together.</p>

			<word>Dhanurveda</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;science of archery&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;Veda&#x2019; is a general term used to indicate any branch of organised knowledge. The word &#x2018;dhanus&#x2019; can mean weapons in general and the bow (and arrow) in particular. Hence &#x2018;Dhanurveda&#x2019; means military science or the science of archery. But, the latter sense is more common.</p>
			<p>Another name commonly used is &#x2018;Dhanurvidyā&#x2019;. It is supposed to be subsidiary to <em>Yajurveda</em>.</p>
			<p>The science itself is quite ancient and there are references to it even in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> and the <em>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>No scientific work known as <em>Dhanurveda</em> is extant now. However, a work called <em>Dhanurveda Saṁhitā</em> available now, is considered to be of a much later date.</p>
			<p>The <em>Agnipurāṇa</em> (chapters 249-252) as also the <em>Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa</em> (chapters 178-182) contain a lot of information about Dhanurveda.</p>
			<p>Weapons of war are generally classified into four groups: Yantramukta (discharged by a contrivance or machine); Pāṇimukta or hastamukta (discharged by hand); Muktāmukta (discharged by hand or used by holding in hand) and amukta (used directly by hand). The examples are arrow, discus, spear and sword respectively.</p>
			<p>The dhanurvidyā is concerned exclusively with archery. Use of bows and arrows was quite common even up to the 16th century.</p>
			<p>Several varieties of the bows. depending upon the material out of which they are made, are mentioned in certain works like the <em>Arthaśāstra</em> of Kauṭilya (300 B. C. They are: kārmuka (made of palm-tree), kodaṇḍa (of bamboo), druṇa (of sandalwood) and dhanu (of bone or horns). Another division is two fold: śārṅga (made of śṛṅga or horns) and vaṁśa (made of bamboo).</p>
			<p>Sometimes these classifications are made keeping the size and the weight in view. One work, the <em>Kodaṇḍamaṇḍana</em>, gives eighteen such varieties.</p>
			<p>In our epics and purāṇas, the Śārṅga of Viṣṇu, the Pināka of Śiva, the Kodaṇḍa of Śrī Rāma and the Gāṇḍīva of Arjuna are known as formidable weapons.</p>
			<p>Since bows are useless without arrows, a lot of information has been provided by these works on the arrows also. They are prepared out of bamboo or steel. Usually feathers of birds are stuck at the back end. Sometimes poisonous substances would be smeared on the front end. Five kinds of arrows—veṇu, śara, daṇḍaśara, śalāka and nārāca—are known to have existed. When discharged with appropriate mantras, they would get transformed into very powerful missiles called &#x2018;astras&#x2019;. Some of the famous astras are Brahmāstra, Pāśupatāstra, Nārāyaṇāstra, Āgneyāstra and Sarpāstra.</p>
			<p>The bag in which the arrows are kept and tied to one&#x2019;s back is called &#x2018;tūṇīra&#x2019;. Some great warriors who had been blessed by the divine powers or deities had &#x2018;akṣaya-tūṇīras,&#x2019; a bag of arrows which would never become empty!</p>
			<p>For discharging the arrows effectively, several postures like samapāda, maṇḍala, ālīḍha and daṇḍayāta have been prescribed which also have to be learnt from a competent teacher like other aspects of archery.</p>
			<p>Though dhanurvidyā was a part of military science, only a brāhmaṇa could be a teacher and even the kṣattriya boys and youth had to learn from him!</p>
			<p>Agastya, Paraśurāma and Bhāra-dvāja were the greatest teachers of this science of archery.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Whether the stars and planets in the sky have any effect on our life here and now, has been a fascinating subject of study for several centuries. This has resulted in the evolution of a regular science called Jyautiṣa (also Jyotiṣa) or astrology.</p>
			<p>Hindu astrological works divide the zodiac—the annual path of the sun round the earth—into 12 equal parts of 30&#xb0; each. Each of these is called a &#x2018;rāśi&#x2019; (a zodiacal sign). The sun travels through these 12 rāśis in a year. The time taken by the sun to travel through one rāśi is the length of a solar month.</p>
			<p>The Dhanus or Dhanūrāśi (also called Taukṣika) is the 9th in the series of 12 and is called Sagittarius (archer) in Greek astrology. It resembles an archer. It comprises the two nakṣatras, Mūlā and Pūrvāṣāḍhā as also the first quarter of Uttarāṣāḍhā.</p>
			<p>If time is considered as a personified being (&#x2018;kālapuruṣa&#x2019;) then Dhanūrāśi forms his thighs. Guru or Bṛhaspati (Jupiter) is said to be the lord of Dhanūrāśi.</p>
			<p>During a day of 24 hours, as the earth goes round itself once, the sun appears to move through all the 12 rāśīs, though the duration of its being seen in each of the rāśis varies. For the Dhanūrāśi it is 5 ghaṭikās and 30 vighaṭikās i.e, 2 hrs. and 12 mts. These movements and their durations are needed in astrological calculations.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;[place sanctified by] the extremity of the bow [of Rāma]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Also spelt as &#x2018;Dhanuṣkoḍi,&#x2019; it is an important place of pilgrimage of hoary antiquity, contiguous with the land-mass of the island of Rāmeśvaram. It got its name from the ancient legend that Rāma, at the request of the king Vibhīṣaṇa, destroyed the bridge he had got built by the monkey-army, with the koṭi (= extremity) of his dhanus (= bow), so that there would be no future invasions of Laṅkā, after its being handed over to Vibhīṣaṇa.</p>
			<p>This small, but beautiful, temple-town situated at a distance of 20 kms. (12.5 miles) from Rāmeśvaram was almost totally devastated by the fierce cyclone of A. D. 1964. Miraculously, only the temple of Kodaṇḍarāmasvāmi survived. It is standing there in its place even today.</p>
			<p>It can be approached by any four-wheeler for a distance of 10 kms. (6.2 miles), the rest of the distance being traversed on foot, since it is laden with sand.</p>
			<p>Where the Kodaṇḍarāmasvāmi temple stands at present (8 kms. or 5 miles from Rāmeśvaram), is said to be the place of surrender of Vibhīṣaṇa (younger brother of Rāvaṇa) at the feet of Rāma.</p>
			<p>The temple itself—of Draviḍian archi-tecture—contains the images of Rāma, Sītā, Lakṣmaṇa, Hanumān and Vibhīṣaṇa.</p>
			<p>At Dhanuṣkoṭi, the Bay of Bengal meets the Indian Ocean. This place is called Ratnākara. Pilgrims take a bath here and perform śrāddhas (obsequial rites).</p>
			<p>There are a number of boulders in shallow waters up to Sri Lanka. This—though called &#x2018;Adam&#x2019;s Bridge&#x2019;—may be the remnant of the famous bridge which Rāma got built during his invasion of Laṅkā. A recent satellite picture seems to indicate the remnants of a very old bridge of boulders here.</p>
			<p>At the edge of the island, there is a range of sand-dunes popularly called &#x2018;floating stones&#x2019;.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Āyurveda, the science of health and longevity, is very ancient. Dhanvantari is said to be the originator of this science.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Considered as a partial manifestation of Viṣṇu and the physician of the gods, Dhanvantari rose from the ocean of milk at the time of churning it (See <ref>SAMUDRA-MATHANA</ref> for details.) with the amṛta-kalaśa or pot of ambrosia in his hands.</p>
			<p>He was reborn as Divodāsa, the king of Kāśī and composed a standard and basic work on the Āyurveda, comprising eight sections.</p>
			<p>Dhanvantari has been mentioned in several works such as <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, <em>Harivaṁśa </em>and<em> Bhāgavata</em>.</p>
			<p>In course of time, &#x2018;Dhanvantari&#x2019; became a title for the very best of physicians, one who had mastered the administration of 300 medicines, the other two titles being bhiṣak (expert in 200 medicines) and vaidya (expert in 100 medicines).</p>
			<p>Nineteen works authored by Dhanvantari have found mention in other standard works. Some of them are: <em>Cikitsā-dīpikā, Bālacikitsā, Dhanvantari-nighaṇṭu, Vaidya-bhāskarodaya</em> and <em>Āyurveda-sārāvalī</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em>Dhanvantari-nighaṇṭu</em> is considered as the most ancient of these works.</p>
			<p>Dhanvantari icons are shown in various postures. A two-armed figure holding the amṛtakalaśa or the pot of ambrosia is the most common. He is shown with four or even six arms, holding the emblems of Viṣṇu like śaṅkha and cakra, apart from the amṛtakalaśa. Sometimes he is shown as bathing himself with the amṛta or nectar, pouring it from the pot.</p>
			<p>In one of the more curious forms he is shown holding a leach in one of his hands, suggesting blood-letting or surgery.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Controlling the vagaries of one&#x2019;s mind and concentrating it on a particular subject has been a life-time&#x2019;s ambition for many a cultured human being. Patañjali (200 B. C.), the ancient teacher of Yoga, has given us enough material and guidance in this regard in his incomparable work, the <em>Yogasūtras</em>.</p>
			<p>Out of the eight standard steps he recommends, dhāraṇā is the sixth. It is the fixing of attention on a definite locus, such as the lotus of the heart (imagining a red, twelve-petalled, lotus in the region of the heart for purposes of meditation), the light in the brain (imagining a brilliant light in the crown of the head), on the tip of the nose or the tongue, or on an external object like the moon or the image of a god and so on.</p>
			<p>It is natural for the fickle mind to get distracted and run away from this object of concentration. However, it is to be repeatedly brought back through strenuous efforts until it develops into dhyāna or continuous flow (of the mind) towards the object.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Temples have exerted a great influence on the Hindu society for several centuries. Though the ancient temples built of perishable materials like wood, have disappeared due to the ravages of nature and time, those built of stones have survived. One such is the Pañca-keśvara temple—also known as Dorānātha temple—at the village Dhāreśvara, near the town Kumaṭa in the North Kanara district of Karnataka. It is a beautiful temple built in the Cāḷukyan style. There is a nice tank just inside the main compound. There are also two &#x2018;hero-stones&#x2019; (<em>Vīragallu</em>, a stone slab or pillar erected in honour of a hero who fought for the people) and a stone edict (A. D. 1083) containing the description of a gift by the local queen.</p>
			<p>According to mythological accounts, when Rāvaṇa, the demon king of Laṅkā, was bringing the ātmaliṅga (śivaliṅga) from Kailāsa, it got stuck on the ground at Gokarṇa (in North Kanara, Karnataka). Rāvaṇa could not dislodge the liṅga from the ground but succeeded in pulling out the cloth and thread from it and threw it away. The thread fell at Dhāreśvara and became a liṅga.</p>
			<p>There are many beautiful images in the area around Dhāreśvara like those of Narasiṁha and Veṇugopāla. There is a broad road in front of the temple for the rathotsava or temple-car festival.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;that which supports&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
			<p>Our scriptures are full of eulogy for dharma. Who has not heard of the famous quotation from the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, &#x2018;dharma eva hato hanti dharmo rakṣati rakṣitaḥ,&#x2019; &#x2018;It is dharma that destroys (us) when destroyed; it is dharma again that protects (us) when protected by (us)&#x2019;? Or, that famous sentence put in the mouth of Gāndhārī, &#x2018;yato dharmastato jayaḥ,&#x2019; &#x2018;Where there is dharma, there victory also is&#x2019;? Consequently we are advised in poignant terms to accumulate dharma in our lives: &#x2018;anityāni śarīrāṇi vibhavo naiva śāśvataḥ, nityaṁ sannihito mṛtyuḥ kartavyo dharma-saṅgrahaḥ,&#x2019; &#x2018;(Our) bodies are short-lived, wealth does not last long, death is constantly knocking at our door; (so) accumulation of dharma is a must.&#x2019;</p>
			<h1>WHAT IS DHARMA?</h1>
			<p>What is this &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; about which our scriptures and great men have waxed so eloquent throughout our history?</p>
			<p>As is the case with many other Sanskrit words, it is rather difficult to give an exact translation of the word dharma. It has been variously translated as &#x2018;religion,&#x2019; &#x2018;law,&#x2019; &#x2018;duty,&#x2019; &#x2018;religious ordinance or rite,&#x2019; &#x2018;code of conduct&#x2019; and so on. It can mean anyone or more or all of these, depending upon the context. The reason seems to be that the word itself has been used in various senses down the ages and its meaning as also scope has been enlarged. It will be worthwhile to study this development.</p>
			<p>It is universally accepted that the word dharma comes from the root &#x2018;dhṛ&#x2019; (&#x2018;to uphold,&#x2019; &#x2018;to support,&#x2019; &#x2018;to sustain&#x2019;). An oftquoted verse from the <em>Mahābhārata</em> says: &#x2018;dhāraṇāt dharmam ityāhuḥ dharmo dhārayate prajāḥ,&#x2019; &#x2018;They call it dharma since it upholds; it is dharma that upholds the people (of the world).&#x2019;</p>
			<p>That which upholds this created universe, supports it and sustains it, without which the universe just falls apart, is dharma. Viewed from this standpoint, dharma is none other than God Himself. It is what the Upaniṣads describe as <em>sat</em> or <em>tat</em>, the very essence of one&#x2019;s being. Whatever conduct or way of life helps us to reveal this fundamental principle in us, can also be called dharma, though in a secondary sense. Hence religious rites, ceremonies and observances, fixed principles of conduct, privileges, duties and obligations of a man depending upon his stage of life and status in society, even rules of law, customs and manners of society—everyone of these can be included under the term dharma.</p>
			<h1>ṚTA AND SATYA</h1>
			<p>It may be interesting and instructive to turn our attention to two more ancient words, ṛta and satya, which are closely connected with, if not forms of, dharma. The word ṛta has been used profusely in the Vedas, especially in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> and the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>. The word in its simplest form, seems to indicate a straight or direct line and so, universal laws of nature, an impersonal order. When extended to the moral world, it denotes a straight conduct based on truth which itself is also dharma. It has also been used in the sense of an inner awareness of what is true, based on the scriptural teachings and the needs of the duties on hand. When this awareness expresses itself through words and actions, it becomes satya. Thus we see that the meanings of all the three words more or less coalesce.</p>
			<h1>DHARMA AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD</h1>
			<p>Since everything in this world appears to have a beginning and an end, with an intervening period of existence, it is but natural for the human intelligence to conceive of a beginning for this creation and to posit an eternal God who existed before creation and from whom creation proceeded. For instance: &#x2018;sadeva somyeda-magra āsīt, ekamevādvitīyam... tadaikṣata bahu syām prajāyeya iti,&#x2019; &#x2018;My dear (boy), in the beginning Sat alone existed, the One without a second. It reflected, &#x201c;May I become many! May I be born!&#x201d; &#x2019; (<em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> 6.2.1-3). The &#x2018;many&#x2019; that were created, needed a central integrating force, a law or a principle; for, otherwise, chaos would result. This law or principle is dharma. Even this was created by God himself: &#x2018;tat śreyorūpam asṛjata dharmam... tasmāt dharmāt param nāsti... yo vai sa dharmaḥ satyaṁ vai tat,&#x2019; &#x2018;He specially created that dharma, of the form of the highest good... therefore there is nothing higher than that... that dharma is verily satya&#x2019; (<em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> 1.4.14). This dharma is the firm foundation upon which the entire universe stands (&#x2018;dharmo viśvasya jagataḥ pratiṣṭhā&#x2019;—<em>Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> 79.7). Obviously here, dharma means righteous behaviour based on truth and knowledge of the unity in spite of the diversity, and capable of bringing the highest good to the whole creation. All other meanings, senses and derivations of this in later literature are corollaries of this central idea.</p>
			<h1>DHARMA AS DUTIES</h1>
			<p>The word dharma occurs in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> fifty-six times (e.g., 5.63.7; 5.72.2; 9.7.1; 9.25.2; 10.88.1; 10.170.2). But in almost all these places it has been used in the sense of duty or action which contributes to the sustenance of the world (&#x2018;jagad-dhāraka-karma&#x2019;). In the Upaniṣads, this sense becomes more explicit. As a member of the society each one of us has certain duties and obligations which must be discharged by performing the prescribed actions. This sustains the structure of the society. Similarly, in our journey towards perfection we have to pass through several stages of spiritual development and each such stage devolves upon us certain duties or a code of conduct. This helps to sustain our inner development and simultaneously contributes to the well-being of the society also. The seeds of this—which is well-known as varṇa-āśrama-dharma in later literature—are to be found in the <em>Puruṣasūkta</em> and in the earlier Upaniṣads also. For instance, in the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> passage already quoted (1.4.14) there is clear reference to dharma as a force that regulates even a kṣattriya, who by virtue of his position as a ruler, could misuse his powers for self-aggrandizement. In the famous passage of the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (2.31.1) the reference to the duties of āśramas is crystal clear: &#x2018;trayo dharmaskandhā yajño&#x2019;dhyayanaṁ dānamiti prathamaḥ...&#x2019; &#x2018;Dharma has three branches. Performance of sacrifice, study of scriptures and giving gifts—this is the first.&#x2019;</p>
			<h1>DHARMA IN THE UPANIṢADS</h1>
			<p>Sometimes, the word dharma has also been used in the Upaniṣads in the sense of apūrva of the Pūrva Mīmāṁsā System (<em>vide Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> 2.5.11—&#x2018;ayaṁ dharmaḥ sarveṣām bhūtānām madhu&#x2019;). This apūrva is nothing but the subtle effect of an action performed as per the directions of the scriptures, which will produce suitable results later.</p>
			<p>In rare cases, the word has also been used to denote the ātman or the Self: &#x2018;aṇureṣa dharmaḥ,&#x2019; &#x2018;This Self is very subtle&#x2019; (<em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> 1.21); &#x2018;evaṁ dharmān pṛthak paśyan,&#x2019; &#x2018;thus, considering the selves to be separate&#x2019; (i.e., &#x2018;different in different bodies&#x2019;) (ibid 4.14).</p>
			<p>In the <em>Ācāryopadeśa</em> of the <em>Taittirīya Upaniṣad</em>, the word dharma has been clearly used in the sense of obligatory works: &#x2018;dharmaṁ cara,&#x2019; &#x2018;Perform your ordained actions&#x2019; (1.11.1).</p>
			<h1>DHARMA IN THE GĪTĀ</h1>
			<p>Coming to the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, we find the term used in a more definite and clear sense. Dharma is righteousness, the basis of all puruṣārthas (18.34). It is one&#x2019;s duty ordained by the scriptures as per one&#x2019;s varṇa and āśrama, by properly performing which, man attains both well-being in this world (abhyudaya) and highest good (niśśreyasa) (<em>vide</em> 4.8; 18.31; 1.40; 7.11 etc.). Sometimes it has also been used as synonymous with ātmajñāna (<em>vide</em> 9.3) or with Karmayoga (2.40).</p>
			<h1>DHARMA IN THE RĀMĀYAṆA</h1>
			<p>Let us now turn to the two epics. The very name <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> has been explained as &#x2018;rāmasya ayanaṁ vṛttaṁ caritam,&#x2019; &#x2018;the path trodden by Rāma or the conduct of Rāma.&#x2019; Śrī Rāma is the hero here, depicted as the ideal man. His conduct was in perfect conformity with dharma as taught and understood then. To such an extent did he go that he has been described by the sage Vālmīki as &#x2018;rāmo vigrahavān dharmaḥ,&#x2019; &#x2018;Rāma is dharma personified&#x2019;. To speak the truth and to keep up the promise given, under all circumstances—this is the keynote of dharma in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>. No hardship is too great, no sacrifice is too great, when compared to the fulfilment of this dharma. Rāma had the full power and strength to vanquish Daśaratha or anybody else and anoint himself as the king. Yet he did not do it since he was afraid of adharma (<em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> 2.53.26). To please his father and help him keep up his promise to Kaikeyī he was prepared to jump into the fire or consume deadly poison or drown himself in the ocean (ibid., 2.18.28-29). He was ready to give up his life or Sītā or even Lakṣmaṇa but would never break the promise once made (ibid., 3.10.19). He was not at all hesitant to forsake even Sītā in order to set up a very high standard of family life. Since his observance of dharma was dynamic, we can safely surmise that he set up new norms of dharma by accepting the hospitality of Guha and Śabarī, by refusing to have more than one wife and by forcing Vibhīṣaṇa to conduct the last rites of Rāvaṇa.</p>
			<h1>DHARMA IN THE MAHĀBHĀRATA</h1>
			<p>The <em>Mahābhārata</em> is a veritable encyclopaedia of dharma. It is here that the well-known definition of dharma (&#x2018;dhāraṇād dharmamityāhuḥ&#x2019;) already quoted, occurs. The epic gives a detailed delineation of the varṇāśrama-dharmas. The dhārmic virtues like satya and ahiṁsā are highly extolled. Performance of ordained duties, however small or mean or repulsive they may appear to be, is recommended and eulogised through the stories of Dharmavyādha, Tulādhāra and the simple housewife. The idea of the four puruṣārthas is well-developed, giving worldly life and worldly pursuits a decent place in the scheme of life. Another very interesting feature of this epic is the relaxation of the well-known moral standards and norms in times of distress and emergencies (termed as āpad-dharma) which bespeaks of the robust common sense of the author of the epic.</p>
			<h1>DHARMA IN MĪMĀṀSĀ AND VAIŚEṢIKA SYSTEMS</h1>
			<p>It may not be out of place here to refer to two more interpretations of dharma. Jaimini in his <em>Pūrvamīmāṁsā Sūtras</em> (1.1.2) uses the word in a very restricted sense: &#x2018;codanā-lakṣaṇo&#x2019;rtho dharmaḥ,&#x2019; &#x2018;Dharma is the desirable goal or result that is indicated by injunctive (Vedic) passages&#x2019;. So, dharma means the Vedic ritualistic actions leading to happiness here or hereafter. Kaṇāda on the other hand, gives a more liberal definition: &#x201c;yato&#x2019;bhyudaya-niśśreyasa-siddhiḥ sa dharmaḥ,&#x201d; &#x2018;Dharma is that from which will result both worldly well-being and final beatitude&#x2019; (<em>Vaiśeṣika Sūtras</em> 1.2).</p>
			<h1>DHARMA IN SMṚTIS AND DHARMAŚĀSTRAS</h1>
			<p>However it is in the smṛtis that we come across a very detailed treatment of the subject of dharma in all its intricacies. That is why they have been rightly designated as &#x2018;Dharmaśāstras.&#x2019; If dharma is the Cosmic Law which holds together the beings of the world and sustains them, it is very necessary that they be given detailed practical instructions about the way of life which helps them to be always in step and in tune with this dharma. Since human beings, like animals, are gregarious by nature, these instructions naturally have to have a sociological bias. This is exactly what the dharmaśāstras have done when they delineate the varṇa-āśrama-dharmas. True to the tradition of our motherland, all the dharmaśāstras owe their allegiance to the Vedas. In addition, they also accept the words and conduct of saints, sages and seers well-versed in the knowledge of the Vedas, as authoritative in determining dharma (<em>vide Manusmṛti</em> 2.6; <em>Gautama Dharmasūtras</em> 1.1-2; <em>Āpastamba Dharmasūtras</em> 1.1.1.2; <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em> 1.7).</p>
			<p>Since man is a rational being and since life-situations are sometimes quite intriguing, the dharmaśāstras wisely recognised the need for reflective morality also, as for instance in <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em> (1.7): &#x2018;śrutiḥ smṛtiḥ sadācāraḥ svasya ca priyamātmanaḥ samyaksaṅkalpajaḥ kāmo dharmamūlam idaṁ smṛtam,&#x2019; &#x2018;The Vedas, smṛtis, usages of good men, what is agreeable to one&#x2019;s self and desire born of deliberation—these are traditionally recognised as the source of dharma&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Hinduism considers man&#x2019;s life as a long journey towards perfection. In this journey, natural desires and inclinations of man to possess and enjoy the good things of life cannot be overlooked. Hence the dharmaśāstras provide for these in their scheme of life while amplifying the theory of the puruṣārthas. Great care has been taken to give detailed rules and regulations in the acquisition of artha (wealth) and kāma (enjoyment of fleshly desires) within the framework of dharma. However, following in the footsteps of the <em>Jñānakāṇḍa</em> (section that deals with spiritual wisdom) of the Vedas, they always stress the importance of trying for mokṣa or liberation as the summum bonum of life (<em>vide</em> <em>Manusmṛti</em> 12.116 to 125).</p>
			<p>No society under the sun is absolutely homogeneous. Differences do exist. Even the five fingers of our own hand exhibit this principle. The dharmaśāstras recognised this natural division, called it God-made and gave detailed instructions regarding the duties and responsibilities of various groups or varṇas of society towards one another in their group and towards other groups. Stressing that these divisions were evolved due to guṇa (quality) and karma (vocation), they have also provided for stringent punishments for derelictions of duty and rewards for sincere performance. Relaxations of these rules have however been provided for, in times of distress.</p>
			<p>While dealing with the duties of a king, the dharmaśāstras have given us a fairly well-developed form of Indian Jurisprudence. Fairness and justice occupy the central place in all these rules (<em>vide Manusmṛti</em>, chapters 8 &amp; 9).</p>
			<p>In consonance with the same principle that life is a long journey towards perfection, stations (āśramas) have been provided in a man&#x2019;s life for effecting this perfection gradually. Detailed directions have been provided with regard to each of the āśramas.</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras have not forgotten to provide for some basic rules common to all the varṇas and āśramas (sāmānya-dharmas). A perusal of these will reveal to us the great stress laid on the moral life.</p>
			<p>To err is human, to forgive divine. For the Divine to forgive, the human being must make himself pure by recognising his own sins and repenting for them. The dharmaśāstras have given us a detailed treatment of the various kinds of sins and necessary expiations or prāyaścittas (<em>vide Manusmṛti</em>, chapters 10 &amp; 11; <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em>, 3.205 to 327; <em>Vasiṣṭha Dharmasūtras</em>, chapters 20 to 28).</p>
			<p>Apart from these, the dharmaśāstras also deal with the saṁskāras or sacraments which purify human beings, making them better fitted for the spiritual journey in life.</p>
			<p>We thus see that the concept of dharma has undergone a healthy evolution over the years, always keeping to the core meaning.</p>
			<h1>DHARMA, NOT A STAGNANT CONCEPT</h1>
			<p>Sometimes it is alleged that the Hindu society is very conservative and its dharma (as social laws, customs and manners) is outmoded and stagnant. An impartial study of the smṛtis shows, on the other hand, that social laws have been constantly changed, depending on the needs of the times. Even Manu and Yājñavalkya, the earliest smṛtikāras, say that when a dharma (a law or rule or custom) is hated or disliked by people (lokavikṛta) it must be given up (<em>vide Manu</em> 4.176). Throughout the social history of India we find the rules and regulations being changed to suit the tastes and needs of the people, though of course, the central spiritual principles have always been kept intact. Criticism of Vedic ritualism by the Upaniṣads, changes in the views regarding anuloma marriages<aside>Marriage of higher caste men with women of lower castes.</aside> and food, the kali-varjya principle<aside>That certain acts permitted in the earlier ages should not be permitted in this age of Kali. For instance, animal sacrifice in Vedic sacrifices.</aside>—all these clearly show that the Hindu sages and law-givers were endowed with immense common sense and that the Hindu society had always been dynamic.</p>
			<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
			<p>Thus the history of dharma from the most ancient days up to the modern period shows that it has always been dynamic and a very real force to reckon with in the life of our nation.</p>
			<p>We have seen how dharma which was conceived of as the Cosmic Law was gradually metamorphosed into duties and responsibilities prescribed for various beings in different stages of evolution in life, but always based on the principle that this evolution should ultimately bring about spiritual enlightenment. If this fact is kept in mind and all the members of the society act according to dharma, there is no reason why all should not live in happiness and peace. After all, the saying, &#x2018;dharmo rakṣati rakṣitaḥ&#x2019; of the great ṛṣi Vyāsa cannot go in vain!</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>How the jīvātman or the individual soul knows an object, whether such know-ledge or consciousness is accidental to it or innate to it, is a subject of discussion in the darśanas or Indian philosophical systems.</p>
			<p>If the Advaita Vedānta posits the view that consciousness is the very nature of the soul, the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta as expounded by Rāmānuja (A. D. 1017-1137) asserts that jñāna or consciousness is always present in Īśvara or God and the jīva or the soul as their dharma or attribute.</p>
			<p>This dharmabhūtajñāna or attributive consciousness is &#x2018;ajaḍa&#x2019; (non-material and also non-spiritual). It illumines itself and other objects. It always exists <em>for another</em> and never for itself. That is, it cannot know itself, but illumines objects for the conscious subject for whom it is an attribute.</p>
			<p>This dharmabhūtajñāna is eternal and all-pervasive in the case of Īśvara, the nityasūris (eternally illumined souls) and the liberated souls. However, in the case of the jīvātman (the soul in bondage) it is contracted or obscured. When the jīvātman realises the beatific form of the Divine through the yogas of karma, jñāna and bhakti, his dharmabhūtajñāna also expands to infinity and becomes perfect.</p>
			<p>Terms such as mati, prajñā, saṁvit and śemuṣī are all synonyms of dharma-bhūtajñāna.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (200 B. C.) is a well-known ancient treatise that deals with the art and science of concentration. This word &#x2018;dharmameghasamādhi&#x2019; is a technical term used there in the sūtra 4.29.</p>
			<p>Viveka (discrimination that the puruṣa or the soul, who is of the nature of consciousness, is separate and distinct from the prakṛti or insentient nature) and vairāgya (dispassion towards prakṛti and its products) are the two basic disciplines that ultimately lead to the purification of the mind and consequent experience of oneself as pure consciousness. When this is achieved through samādhi or perfect concentration, then even the seeds of old saṁskāras or tendencies that might rise up and disturb the mind, are completely transcended.</p>
			<p>But this experience of prasaṅkhyāna or knowledge that one is the conscious spirit, separate and different from the prakṛti, may produce a sort of attachment to that state itself as also to the psychic powers that may result from it. However elevated it is, an attachment even to that state is to be overcome. The yogi who is not attracted even by this, attains &#x2018;dharmameghasamādhi&#x2019;. In this state his vivekakhyāti (knowledge or experience of his separateness from the insentient prakṛti) is constant, continuous and permanent. Such a state is called &#x2018;dharma-meghasamādhi,&#x2019; because it &#x2018;rains&#x2019; on him, like the rainbearing cloud (= megha), the &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; or the special quality of not being affected by any type of karma he does—because he is now a liberated person—which karma is aśukla-kṛṣṇa, neither white (good) nor black (bad), incapable of producing any fruits.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Situated at a distance of about 50 kms. (31 miles) from the city of Madras (now called &#x2018;Chennai&#x2019;), on an open beach, is the village Mahābalipuram or Māmalla-puram, by name. It has carved for itself an important place in the archaeological map of India since it contains ancient rock-cut temples called &#x2018;Rathas,&#x2019; belonging to the period A. D. 670 to 700 and built by the Pallava king Rājasiṁha, also known as Narasiṁhavarman.</p>
			<p>These Rathas, seven of them, have withstood the vagaries of time and weather, since they have been cut in granite and in single blocks or big boulders. The Dharmarājaratha is the biggest of them. (A &#x2018;ratha&#x2019; is a chariot or a temple-car, the same as a vimāna or the shrine of the temple.)</p>
			<p>This Ratha is almost a square structure, measuring 8 metres by 8 metres and rising up to 10.5 meters (26 ft. square and 35 ft. in height). It has three storeys including the ground floor. There are a number of images of Hindu gods like Śiva, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Ardhanārīśvara, Narasiṁha and Varāha. Over these images are short epigraphs containing the name of the king who built the Ratha.</p>
			<p>This Ratha too, as the others, seems to be incomplete. It looks as though the construction was suddenly stopped.</p>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>The concept of dharma and its appli-cation to the various aspects of life is of fundamental importance in Hinduism. The concept itself has undergone several changes over the centuries. As derived from the root &#x2018;dhṛ&#x2019; (&#x2018;to support, to sustain&#x2019;), the most general meaning of the word &#x2018;dharma&#x2019; is &#x2018;that which supports and sustains&#x2019;. Gradually it came to acquire several senses such as—ordinance, usage, duty, right, justice, morality, virtue, reli-gion, good works, function or characteristic. However, the sense of &#x2018;duties and responsibilities based on some fundamental moral virtues&#x2019; became most widely accepted.</p>
			<h3>Sources of Dharma</h3>
			<p>The Vedas being the primary scriptures of Hinduism, naturally get the pride of place as the definer and the source of dharma. But, with the growth of the human society and the consequent problems it had to face, there arose a great need to expand the scope of and to delve deeper into, the concept itself. It is this that gave rise to the composition of the later works, now included under the comprehensive term &#x2018;dharmaśāstras.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>According to all these works, the sources of dharma are: the Vedas; the smṛtis; the teachings and conduct of persons who are well-versed in the scriptures and are of unblemished character; one&#x2019;s own conscience.</p>
			<h3>Growth of the Dharmaśāstras</h3>
			<p>Though the Vedas do not have positive precepts on matters of dharma—concerning personal conduct and social regulations as understood and defined by the later works, they do contain incidental references to various topics that fall under the domain of the dharmaśāstras. There are at least 50 passages in the Vedas that shed light on the forms of marriage, different kinds of sons, adoption of a son, partition, inheritance, śrāddha ceremony and strīdhana or property that should rightfully accrue to women. All these topics have been dealt with in much greater detail in the dharmaśāstras.</p>
			<p>The first stage in the evolution of the dharmaśāstras is met with in the Vedāṅga (&#x2018;limb of the Veda&#x2019; or a subsidiary of the Veda) called &#x2018;kalpasūtras.&#x2019; &#x2018;Kalpa&#x2019; means procedure, the &#x2018;how&#x2019; of a thing.</p>
			<p>The kalpasūtras comprise four sections:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>śrautasūtras;</li>
				<li>gṛhyasūtras;</li>
				<li>dharmasūtras and</li>
				<li>śulbasūtras.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The first and the last are directly concerned with Vedic sacrifices. Whereas the gṛhyasūtras deal with the rites and ceremonies to be performed by a householder in his house (gṛha = house), the dharmasūtras are concerned with the more general and social aspects of dharma, the conduct of human beings as members of a society, of a community. However, these two are interconnected and even inter-dependent.</p>
			<p>In the gṛhyasūtras and the dharma-sūtras, the language is archaic and the delineation of the subjects is not very systematic. Hence the need arose for the composition of another class of works, now well-known as &#x2018;smṛtis,&#x2019; written in a more intelligible language and mostly in poetical verses, to facilitate easy remembrance. Quite a few of these smṛtis are now available in print.</p>
			<p>Though the dharmasūtras in general, are more ancient than the metrical smṛtis, it is equally possible that some from the latter group like the <em>Manusmṛti</em>, are as old as the former or even older. At least, the core-content could be so.</p>
			<p>As the implementation of the rules of conduct in the society progressed, problems, including differences of opinion must have cropped up. Hence, commentaries on these works, attempting to expand the ideas given there or clear the doubts and anomalies, were written by competent scholars, thus enriching the whole field of dharmaśāstra literature.</p>
			<p>As the number of such compositions increased, it became necessary to produce ready-reference material, containing abstracts, surveys and reviews, of all the matter available on that subject. This gave rise to another class of works known as &#x2018;nibandhas&#x2019; or digests.</p>
			<p>The two epics—the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> and the <em>Mahābhārata</em>—as also many of the purāṇas contain a lot of material that should normally be the concern of the dharmaśāstras. The nibandhas, naturally, have made good use of this material at the appropriate places.</p>
			<p>Hence any standard work on the dharmaśāstras should avail of all the relevant stuff provided by these various sources.</p>
			<h3>Topics of the Dharmaśāstras</h3>
			<p>The topics generally dealt with in the dharmaśāstras fall under three broad groups: ācāra (general conduct), vyavahāra (social conduct, law and order) and prāyaścitta (expiatory rites for transgressions).</p>
			<p>They may now be described briefly.</p>
			<h3>Ācāra</h3>
			<p>Unless the body-mind complex is kept clean and pure, both physically and ceremonially, a human being cannot attain dharma in its two primary aspects, viz., abhyudaya (worldly progress) and niśśre-yasa (spiritual welfare). This is achieved by strictly following ācāra or the code of conduct, prescribed to be followed in one&#x2019;s personal life. This code as ordained in the śruti (the Vedas), the smṛtis (the secondary scriptures) and sadācāra (conduct of the sagely persons) should be practised meticulously, without indolence or neglect. Sadācāra (good conduct) leads to long life, fulfilment of desires and attainment of wealth, whereas durācāra (bad and sinful conduct) results in disease, suffering, short-life and ill-fame.</p>
			<p>The ācāra or sadācāra concerns mainly what are termed as &#x2018;ṣaṭkarmas&#x2019; or six daily rituals. They are: snāna &amp; sandhyā (bath and the sandhyā ritual), japa (repetition of Vedic mantras or God&#x2019;s name), homa (oblations into a consecrated fire), devapūja (worship of gods), ātithya (entertaining the guests) and vaiśvadeva (offering cooked food to all the gods).</p>
			<p>Tarpaṇa or ceremonial offering of water with appropriate mantras, to devas (the gods), ṛṣis (sages) and pitṛs (manes) is also included in the daily routine.</p>
			<p>Some aspects of these karmas like bath, worship of one&#x2019;s family deity, repetition of the divine name and entertaining guests, apply to persons of all castes without any distinction.</p>
			<p>As an important part of the &#x2018;ācāra-kāṇḍa&#x2019; (section dealing with the ācāras), the ṣoḍaśasaṁskāras or 16 purificatory sacraments are also delineated. Upa-nayana (investiture with the sacred thread called &#x2018;yajñopavīta&#x2019; and the imparting of the famous Gāyatrī-mantra), vivāha (marriage) and antyeṣṭi (after-death ceremonies) are the most prominent of the 16 sacraments.</p>
			<p>Another aspect of life, which is cardinal to Hindu religion and society, viz., the varṇa-āśrama-dharmas, has also been given the primary place in all the dharmaśāstra works in the ācāra section.</p>
			<h3>Vyavahāra</h3>
			<p>Though the word &#x2018;vyavahāra&#x2019; refers to the general social conduct, in the dharmaśāstras it is used in a more technical sense, that of civil and criminal law.</p>
			<p>In this section 18 subjects have been dealt with. Some of them are: ṛṇādāna (debts), sambhūya-samutthāna (partnership), saṁvid-vyatikrama (breach of contract), kraya-vikraya (purchase and sale), svāmi-pāla-vivāda (disputes between the master and the servant), sīmāvivāda (boundary disputes), daṇḍapāruṣya (assault), vākpāruṣya (libel), steya (theft), strīsaṅgrahaṇa (abduction of women), strīpuṁdharma (relation between husband and wife) and vibhāga (partition).</p>
			<p>The king&#x2019;s court was the judiciary. He was assisted by men of knowledge, wisdom and character in the dispensation of justice. He could also depute a judge to act on his behalf. There were duly appointed persons to oversee the implementation of the decisions taken by the court.</p>
			<h3>Prāyaścitta</h3>
			<p>To err is human. Human beings are prone to commit errors of omission and commission. If they do not realise their faults and mistakes, and do not reform themselves, they have to suffer a lot. This reformation has to be in two stages: repentance and a firm resolve that the mistake will not be repeated; expiation for the ones already committed.</p>
			<p>The mistakes are called &#x2018;pātaka or pāpa&#x2019; (sin) and the expiations, &#x2018;prāyaścitta&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The prāyaścitta sections of the dharmaśāstras describe the various types of sins, categorise them into mahāpātakas (mortal sins) and upapātakas (venial sins) and prescribe the necessary expiations.</p>
			<p>Sins like brahmahatyā (killing a brāhmaṇa), surāpāna (drinking wine and other intoxicating liquids) and incest are classed among the mahāpātakas. Minor sins like forsaking the sacred fires, offending the guru (Vedic teacher), minor thefts, non-payment of debts, selling prohibited articles, cutting down trees or killing harmless animals and so on, are grouped under upapātakas.</p>
			<p>The prāyaścittas can vary from certain modes of tapas (austerities) like fasting, japa (repetition of certain Vedic formulae or names of God), dāna (giving gifts), going on a pilgrimage (for minor sins), right up to religious suicide (for heinous sins).</p>
			<h3>The Philosophy of the Dharmaśāstras</h3>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras are not only based on the Vedas, but, amplify their teachings for better application at day-to-day practical level. Of course, they do not forget to emphasise that the final goal of human life is the attainment of God who is one without a second, who is called by various names, who is the Supreme Ruler of the universe, the origin of creation and its final destination.</p>
			<p>It is admirable that the dharma-śāstras have recognised the importance of the physical body—its health, strength and energy as also its protection against dangers in times of emergency—as basic to any achievement in life, whether spiritual or temporal. Hence they advise everyone to protect his life and limb by all means at his disposal.</p>
			<p>However, this is only the first step. Equally important is the cultivation of moral values. All the dharmaśāstra works, without exception, lay great stress on the sāmānya-dharmas or universal principles of truth, self control, decent and dignified behaviour (especially towards the women-folk), earning one&#x2019;s livelihood by honest and right means, performing one&#x2019;s duties and discharging the obligations to one&#x2019;s family and the society, not harming others, personal and environmental cleanliness, study of (or listening to) sacred literature, a certain degree of austerity and devotion to God.</p>
			<h3>Some Important Dharmaśāstra Works</h3>
			<p>The dharmaśāstra literature (in Sans-krit) is very vast. Apart from the well-known works directly composed on the topics of the dharmaśāstras, there are innumerable verses spread over the two epics and the purāṇas dealing with the various aspects of the subject. Here, an attempt will be made to give a very brief account of the more ancient and important of the works.</p>
			<h1>DHARMASŪTRAS</h1>
			<h3>Āpastamba Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>This work forms the 28th and the 29th praśnas or sections of the bigger work, the <em>Āpastamba Kalpasūtras</em>. It belongs to the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>. When compared with the <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em> of the same author, there are a few sūtras which are identical and the topics are inter-related. It may be assigned to the period 450-350 B. C. The style is more archaic and the sūtras are very concise.</p>
			<p>A wide range of topics normally dealt with in the dharmaśāstras are found here also though the prāyaścitta portion is more elaborate. One of its peculiarities is that it abounds in the technical terms and doctrines of the Pūrvamīmāṁsā school.</p>
			<h3>Auśanasa Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>Kāvya Uśanas is an ancient sage mentioned even in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>.</p>
			<p>There is an <em>Auśanasa Dharmaśāstra</em> mostly in prose, available now, though in parts. The topics dealt with are: aśauca (impurity on birth and death), the four varṇas and some mixed castes, prāya-ścittas and śrāddha (obsequial rites).</p>
			<p>The <em>Auśanasa Dharmasūtras</em> is in prose and contains material identical with that of some parts of the <em>Manusmṛti</em>. From the writings of other authors it is possible to assume that a bigger sūtra work was available, dealing with all the three aspects of ācāra, vyavahāra and prāyaścitta.</p>
			<p>Another dharmaśāstra and also a smṛti, both ascribed to Uśanas are available now either in print or in the manuscript form. The former has 51 verses and deals mainly with the mixed castes such as sūta and māgadha. The latter has 600 verses in 9 chapters and deals with such topics as upanayana and śrāddha.</p>
			<h3>Baudhāyana Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>Baudhyāna probably lived during the period 600-300 B. C. and belonged to South India. His work on all the four branches of the Kalpa are available now.</p>
			<p>The <em>Dharmasūtras</em> is in 4 praśnas or khaṇḍas (sections). The subjects dealt with are: upanayana, duties of a brahma-cārin, several purificatory rites, forms of marriage, śrāddha ceremonies, saṁnyāsa and some rites for securing siddhis or supernatural powers.</p>
			<p>The <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em> deals mainly with the saṁskāras.</p>
			<h3>Gautama Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>This ancient work is entirely in prose and can be assigned to the period 600-400 B. C. It has 28 chapters.</p>
			<p>The topics dealt with are: details of the upanayana for the various varṇas, the four āśramas, avocations of the four varṇas, saṁskāras or sacraments, details of the duties of a king including crime and punishment, duties of women, prāyaścittas, rules of partition of property and a few other minor topics.</p>
			<h3>Hārīta Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>Hārīta is considered as an ancient teacher since he has been quoted by Āpastamba, Baudhāyana and Vasiṣṭha. The work available now has thirty chapters. He speaks of eight kinds of marriages, of which kṣāttra and mānuṣa have replaced ārṣa and prājāpatya given in other works. He mentions two kinds of women, brahmavādinīs and sadyovadhūs, the former being entitled to undergo upanayana, to the study of the Vedas and even to the maintenance of Vedic fires.</p>
			<p>This work may be assigned to the period 600-300 B. C.</p>
			<h3>Hiraṇyakeśi Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>This treatise forms the 26th and the 27th praśnas of the <em>Kalpasūtras</em> by Hiraṇyakeśin. It has borrowed profusely from the sūtra works of Āpastamba and Bhāradvāja. Hence, it is not considered as an independent authority.</p>
			<p>The author belonged to the Taittirīya school of <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em> and lived in the Konkan region (West Coast, South India).</p>
			<h3>Vaikhānasa Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>The work as available now, is a small one. It is also called <em>Vaikhānasa-dharma-praśna</em>. It is considered as a later production, by a devotee of Nārāyaṇa and may belong to the period A. D. 300-400. It could be a redaction of an earlier work.</p>
			<p>It mentions four kinds each, of brahmacārins, gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas and saṁnyāsins.</p>
			<p>Purification of golden and other metallic objects as also other things before their use, mentioned here seems to be interesting.</p>
			<h3>Vasiṣṭha Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>Assigned to the period 300-100 B. C. this work is not a part of a kalpasūtra. It is very similar to the <em>Dharmasūtras</em> of Baudhāyana and Gautama.</p>
			<p>The topics dealt with are almost the same as in other, similar, works. He mentions only six forms of marriage, allows niyoga (levirate) and the remarriage of child-widows. Administration of justice by the king is another important subject dealt with.</p>
			<h3>Viṣṇu Dharmasūtras</h3>
			<p>This book professes to be a revelation of Viṣṇu in his Varāha or Boar-incarnation. It is said to belong to the Kaṭha school of the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>. It has a hundred chapters in mixed prose and verse, of which some parts are in common with the <em>Kāṭhaka Gṛhyasūtras</em>, popular in Kashmir.</p>
			<p>It draws heavily on the <em>Manusmṛti</em>. Rājadharma (duties of a king), crime and punishment, twelve kinds of sons, mixed castes and funeral rites are some of the topics dealt with.</p>
			<p>The date of the older part of this treatise is fixed as 300-100 B. C.</p>
			<h1>SMṚTIS</h1>
			<h3>Aṅgirasa Smṛti</h3>
			<p>Aṅgiras is one of the ten primordial sages and has been mentioned even in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>.</p>
			<p>Three smṛtis bearing his name have been published so far. The first one has 72 verses and is probably an abridgement. It deals mainly with prāyaścittas.</p>
			<p>The second one has 168 verses, the subject being, again, prāyaścittas. It mentions some of the well-known authors of smṛtis like Āpastamba, Śaṅkhalikhita and Sumantu.</p>
			<p>The third one has 1200 verses and is different from the other two editions.</p>
			<h3>Atri Smṛti</h3>
			<p>Atri was an ancient writer on dharma. Even Manu refers to him.</p>
			<p>There is one <em>Ātreya Dharmaśāstra</em> available in 9 chapters. The work is in verses as well as in prose, in the sūtra form.</p>
			<p>The topics dealt with are: gifts, prayers, austerities and expiations.</p>
			<p>The work refers to a number of foreign tribes such as Śakas, Yavanas, Bāhlīkas and Paraśas.</p>
			<p>There are other works styled <em>Atri Smṛti</em> or <em>Atri Saṁhitā</em> available in the manuscript form. They contain secret expiations for sins. They also deal with gifts and ācāra.</p>
			<p>Another <em>Atri Saṁhitā</em>, available in print has 400 verses and deals with the duties of the four castes.</p>
			<p>Two more works—<em>Laghu Atri</em> and <em>Vṛddha-ātreya Smṛti</em> are also available.</p>
			<h3>Bṛhaspati Smṛti</h3>
			<p>Bṛhaspati was an ancient teacher of arthaśāstra (economics and political science). He probably wrote a dharmasūtra work which is not available now. He has been quoted by several writers on the dharmaśāstras. Some writers consider him as an atheist.</p>
			<p>The <em>Bṛhaspati Smṛti</em> available now has seven sections (mostly in verses) dealing with vyavahāra (social conduct), ācāra (general conduct) including āpad-dharma (emergency measures) and prāyaścitta.</p>
			<p>He is assigned to the period A. D. 300-500.</p>
			<h3>Bṛhat-Parāśara Smṛti</h3>
			<p>This is an extensive work of a late period, in 12 chapters comprising 3000 verses. It seems to be a recast of the <em>Parāśara Smṛti</em> by one Suvrata. The subjects dealt with are: ṣaṭkarmas or six items of the daily routine, saṁskāras, aśauca, prāyaścittas, duties of the four āśramas, rājadharma (a king&#x2019;s duties and responsibilities) and yogic disciplines.</p>
			<h3>Dakṣa Smṛti</h3>
			<p>This smṛti is an old one. Printed texts have 220 verses distributed in seven chapters. The subjects treated are: the four āśramas, daily round of duties of the dvijas, various types of action, making gifts, aśauca, yoga and its limbs, philosophies of the dvaita and the advaita schools.</p>
			<p>This smṛti has been extensively quoted by others.</p>
			<h3>Devala Smṛti</h3>
			<p>Devala is a sage whose name often appears in the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, sometimes, along with another sage Asita. A dharma-sūtra treatise—probably an extensive one—has been attributed to him. It perhaps contained sections on ācāra, vyavahāra and śrāddha, as can be guessed by the numerous quotations in other works.</p>
			<p>The <em>Devala Smṛti</em> available now seems to be a late work. It is in 90 verses and deals with purificatory rites.</p>
			<h3>Gobhila Smṛti</h3>
			<p>There is a gṛhyasūtra work of Gobhila belonging to the <em>Sāmaveda</em>. The <em>Gobhila Smṛti</em> available now has 491 verses in three sections. Topics like yajñopavīta, upākarma and śrāddha are dealt with in this work.</p>
			<h3>Kātyāyana Smṛti</h3>
			<p>Nārada, Bṛhaspati and Kātyāyana are the Trinity of sages considered as authorities in ancient Hindu Law. His work as available now has 973 verses (with an addenda of another 121 verses). Portions of the work on the vyavahāra section are yet to be recovered. He might have lived during the period 4th to 6th cent. A. D.</p>
			<p>Another work, also attributed to Kātyāyana is available in 3 sections comprising 29 chapters and about 500 verses. The contents are: details of wearing the sacred thread, worship of Gaṇeśa and the various goddesses in religious rites, some information connected with Vedic sacrifices, chanting of Vedic mantras, śrāddha and aśauca.</p>
			<h3>Manusmṛti</h3>
			<p>The <em>Manusmṛti</em> is the most ancient and authoritative among the extant metrical treatises on dharma. It has 12 chapters and 2684 verses, covering all the three aspects of a typical dharmaśāstra as follows: ācāra (chs. 1-7), vyavahāra (chs. 8-10) and prāyaścitta (chs. 11 &amp; 12).</p>
			<p>The topics dealt with include: creation of the world, four āśramas, the sixteen saṁskāras, śrāddha, the four varṇas (castes), disputes and their resolution, āpad-dharmas (conduct during emergencies), the mortal sins and their expiation, good and bad deeds as also the nature of the Ātman.</p>
			<p>The extant work may be assigned to the period 300 B. C. It may have undergone quite a few redactions.</p>
			<h3>Nārada Smṛti</h3>
			<p>The printed edition of this work has 21 chapters and 1028 verses. It was probably composed during A. D. 100-300.</p>
			<p>It follows the <em>Manusmṛti</em> closely. It has been quoted by a few authors of nibandhas. The contents are generally the same as in the other dharmaśāstras. Nārada differs from Manu in some respects and has introduced many sub-divisions in the major topics. His classification of impotent persons, women who can remarry, as also some of the juristic and political principles distinguish it from other works.</p>
			<h3>Parāśara Smṛti</h3>
			<p>Though Parāśara was an ancient sage, the present work available in print must be a product of several revisions. The <em>Parāśara Smṛti</em> is said to be the ideal guide for this Kaliyuga or the Iron-age. It has 12 chapters and 592 verses. It deals only with ācāra and prāyaścitta.</p>
			<p>The contents are: the four yugas, the six daily duties, Vedic study, duties of a householder, the four varṇas and their duties, remarriage of widows under certain conditions, purification of various articles of use and expiations of various types for sins.</p>
			<p>Two more works—the <em>Bṛhat-Parāśara</em> and the <em>Vṛddha-Parāśara</em>—are also available which are obviously later compositions.</p>
			<h3>Saṁvarta Smṛti</h3>
			<p>The <em>Saṁvarta Smṛti</em> as available in print today has 230 verses. It contains very ancient material. The extant work may be an epitome of the original smṛti. It is in the form of teaching given by the sage Saṁvarta to Vāmadeva and other sages.</p>
			<p>Its main contents are: rules of conduct for the brahmacārin; prāyaścittas for lapses on the part of the brahmacārin and others; duties of householders, forest hermits and monks.</p>
			<p>Other authors have referred to the views of Saṁvarta on topics of vyavahāra by quoting him.</p>
			<h3>Vyāsa Smṛti</h3>
			<p>There is a smṛti ascribed to Vyāsa and is available now. It has four chapters and 250 verses. It can be assigned to the period A. D. 200-500.</p>
			<p>The contents can be summarised as follows: authoritativeness of the Śruti, the smṛti and the purāṇas; the sixteen saṁskāras; mixed castes; duties of a brahmacārin; marriage; nitya (obligatory) naimittika (occasional) and kāmya (desire-motivated) karmas; eulogy of the householder stage and a few other related topics.</p>
			<h3>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</h3>
			<p>Yājñavalkya is a highly respected and one of the most brilliant and outstanding sages of ancient India. The <em>Śukla Yajurveda</em> was revealed to him.</p>
			<p>The smṛti that goes in his name now, has 1010 verses distributed among the three kānḍas or sections dealing with all the three topics: ācāra, vyavahāra and prāyaścitta. The whole work is well-organised and is in the classical anuṣṭubh metre.</p>
			<p>The subjects dealt with can be briefly stated as follows: saṁskāras, marriage, varṇa and jāti, dāna, śrāddha, details of civil disputes and the methods of solving them, crime and punishment, aśauca and prāyaścittas as also some miscellaneous topics.</p>
			<p>The original text must have undergone several revisions. The present form probably belongs to the period 100 B. C. to A. D. 300.</p>
			<h3>Yama Smṛti</h3>
			<p>Yama was probably a great sage since his views have been quoted even in the <em>Vasiṣṭha Dharmasūtras</em>.</p>
			<p>The extant smṛti has 78 verses dealing with prāyaścitta and śuddhi (purificatory rites).</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that he prescribes punishment for cutting trees, shrubs, plants and creepers, especially if they have flowered or have fruits!</p>
			<h1>NIBANDHAS</h1>
			<h3>Caturvargacintāmaṇi</h3>
			<p>This is an encyclopaedic work by Hemādri on ancient religious rites and observances. It might have been composed during the period A. D. 1260-1270. Four volumes containing 6000 verses have so far been printed. The complete work has not been recovered till now. The four puruṣārthas form the main content of the work. The topics of vrata (religious rites and observances), dāna (gifts), śrāddha (obsequial ceremonies) and kāla (time and proper periods for the observance of religious rites) have been dealt with in great deal.</p>
			<h3>Kalpataru</h3>
			<p>The <em>Kalpataru</em> or the <em>Kṛtya-kalpataru</em> of Lakṣmīdhara is a voluminous work in fourteen kāṇḍas or Books. Lakṣmīdhara was a minister in the cabinet of the king Govindacandra of Kanauj (A. D. 1114-1154).</p>
			<p>This treatise has exercised tremendous influence in North India for over 500 years.</p>
			<p>The subjects dealt with in these fourteen kāṇḍas are: duties of brahma-cārins and gṛhasthas, āhnika, śrāddha, vratas, pūjā (worship of gods), pilgrimage, prāyaścittas, śuddhi, duties of a king, law and administration, śāntis (propitiatory rites) and mokṣa (liberation).</p>
			<h3>Nirṇayasindhu</h3>
			<p>An extensive and erudite work of Kamalākara Bhaṭṭa, this was probably composed around A. D. 1612. About a hundred smṛtis and three hundred authors of nibandhas have been named in this treatise.</p>
			<p>The topics dealt with are: kāla, vratas, saṁskāras, Agnihotra, śrāddhas, kalivarjyas (actions forbidden in the Kaliyuga), aśauca and also saṁnyāsa.</p>
			<h3>Smṛticandrikā</h3>
			<p>This is a well-known digest on the dharmaśāstra topics, by Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa (circa A. D. 1150-1225), most probably from South India.</p>
			<p>The contents are: varṇa-āśrama-dharmas; saṁskāras; daily duties of a dvija; sandhyā, śrauta and smārta rites; rules about food; the five daily sacrifices; procedure of law-courts; dāyabhāga; and śrāddhas.</p>
			<p>Though several writers composed works styled <em>Smṛticandrikā</em>, it is only Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa&#x2019;s work that is held as authoritative and relied upon.</p>
			<h3>Smṛtikaustubha</h3>
			<p>Composed around the period A. D. 1645-1695 by Anantadeva (grandson of the famous Marathi saint and poet Eknāth), this vast digest deals with several topics such as: the sixteen saṁskāras, rules for adoption, festivals and sacred days, vāstu śāstra (architecture and town planning), coronation of a king, homas and śāntis.</p>
			<h3>Smṛtiratnākara</h3>
			<p>Caṇḍeśvara (circa A. D. 1314), the author of this extensive digest was a minister in the court of the king Bhaveśvara of Mithilā. This work is also known as the <em>Ratnākara</em>. It contains seven sections, each of them being called &#x2018;Ratnākara&#x2019;. They are: <em>Kṛtyaratnākara, Dānaratnākara, Śuddhiratnākara, Pūjā-ratnākara, Vyavahāraratnākara, Vivāda-ratnākara</em> and <em>Gṛhastharatnākara.</em></p>
			<p>The subjects dealt with comprise the following areas: vratas, duties of house-holders, various kinds of gifts, civil and criminal law, aśauca as also pūjā.</p>
			<h3>Smṛtitattva</h3>
			<p>This is the work of Raghunandana (A. D. 1510-1580), the last great writer of Bengal on the dharmaśāstras. It is divided into 28 sections, each being called &#x2018;tattva&#x2019;, such as <em>Tithitattva</em>, <em>Durgāpūjātattva</em>, <em>Dāyatattva</em> and so on. The topics delineated include—purificatory rites, sacraments, festivals like Janmāṣṭamī and Durgotsava, civil law, public utility works, religious observances, establishment of temples, śrāddha and so on.</p>
			<h3>Vīramitrodaya</h3>
			<p>The <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> of Mitramiśra (circa A. D. 1610-1640) is a vast digest of dharmaśāstras, the second largest in size. Each of the sections is named as a &#x2018;prakāśa,&#x2019; such as <em>Vyavahāraprakāśa</em>, <em>Saṁskāraprakāśa</em>, <em>Rājanītiprakāśa</em> and so on.</p>
			<p>The contents include the following topics: āhnika, pūjā, pilgrimage, civil law, saṁskāras, rājanīti or political science, giving gifts, purificatory rites, śrāddha, prāyaścittas, bhakti and mokṣa.</p>
			<h3>Other Sources</h3>
			<p>Apart from the dharmasūtras, the smṛtis and the nibandhas, another factor that has contributed significantly to the enormous growth of this class of literature is the composition of learned commentaries on these works. These commentaries have explained the originals, expounded the various doctrines and subtle points and resolved many doubts and misgivings, thus giving a clear practical direction for implementing the various rules of the originals.</p>
			<p>The following table gives some idea of these commentaries:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Commentaries of Haradatta, Maska-rin and Asahāya on the <em>Gautama Dharmasūtras</em>.</li>
				<li>Bhāṣyas (expositions) of Medhātithi, Kullūka and five others on the <em>Manusmṛti</em>.</li>
				<li> <em>Bālakrīḍā</em> of Viśvarūpa, <em>Mitākṣarā</em> of Vijñāneśvara and <em>Dikpālikā</em> of Śūlapāṇi on the famous <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em>.</li>
				<li> <em>Parāśara-mādhavīya</em> by Mādhavā-cārya (Vidyāraṇya) and <em>Vidvanmanoharā</em> of Nandapaṇḍita on the <em>Parāśara Smṛti</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <em>Arthaśāstra</em> of Kauṭilya (300 B. C.) along with its two commentaries <em>Nayacandrikā</em> of Mādhava Yajvan and <em>Pratipadapañcikā</em> of Bhaṭṭa Svāmin contains a lot of material on vyavahāra and rāja-dharma, two of the important topics discussed by most of the dharmaśāstras.</p>
			<p>The <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>, though a kāvya or a literary composition, contains quite a few references to some of the topics discussed in the dharmaśāstra treatises. Details of the coronation of a king, effects of anarchy, sins (and expiations), duties and responsi-bilities of a king, obsequial rites, value of truth, and, duties and virtues of women—all these topics have found a place in the epic, here and there.</p>
			<p>Similarly, the <em>Mahābhārata</em> also contains a lot of material that comes under the purview of the dharmaśāstras. The following are the subjects dealt with, some briefly, others more exhaustively: coronation, evils of anarchy, ahiṁsā (non-violence), the dharmas of the varṇas and āśramas, ācāra, āpad-dharmas, pilgrimage, giving gifts, dāyabhāga, expiations for sins, rules regarding food, political science (in detail), marriage and śrāddha.</p>
			<p>The eighteen principal purāṇas as also some of the minor ones contain extensive and very rich material on the various topics discussed in the dharma-śāstras. That is why the commentators and the authors of the nibandhas have quoted from them profusely.</p>
			<p>A brief list of these topics as they appear in the purāṇas may now be given:</p>
			<p>ācāra, āhnika, aśauca, varṇa-āśrama-dharmas, rules about food, dāna, kali-varjya (what is prohibited in the Kaliyuga), sins and their expiations, duties of a king, saṁskāras, śāntis, śrāddha, pilgrimages, vratas, vyavahāra and yugadharmas (special characteristics of the four yugas).</p>
			<h3>Epilogue</h3>
			<p>The Hindu society has had a chequered history over the last 2500 years. The dharmaśāstras too, have grown over the same period, not only to voluminous but also to highly refined, proportions. They have played a very significant part in preserving the unity and solidarity of the society to a considerable extent.</p>
			<p>This they have done by:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>preserving the basic values of life compressed in one omnibus term called &#x2018;dharma.&#x2019;</li>
				<li>stressing the duties and respons-ibilities towards the society <em>much more</em> than rights and privileges.</li>
				<li>making the necessary adjustments to suit the needs of the changing times.</li>
				<li>not allowing any socio-political rule to have an absolute status, but always preferring a well-established custom to the rule in the Book.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As long as there were Hindu rulers to enforce the code of conduct as prescribed by the dharmaśāstras, there was order and peace in the society. When the political power passed into the hands of ruthless alien rulers, even a safe and honourable existence became a serious problem. Hence the religious and social leaders, swimming against the current, made supreme efforts to preserve the unity and integrity of the society by modifying the ācāra and the prāyaścitta parts of dharma as much as possible, since the vyavahāra part had practically passed out of their hands.</p>
			<p>There is a charge that the writers of the dharmaśāstras of later periods (A. D. 1000 onwards) unnecessarily went into great depths to discuss small details. One should not forget that, by this time, the dharmaśāstras had become an important subject for study and discussion even in the academic circles of the day, in the traditional institutions like Maṭhas, Pāṭhaśālas and Vidyālayas. Hence, this scholarship was both necessary and useful in those circles.</p>
			<p>Another accusation levelled against these dharmaśāstras is that they were meant only for the first three castes, that too for the brāhmaṇas and the kṣattriya rulers, and were not very helpful to the others. The reply is that the society of those days was like that and hence these works had to be in tune with the same. An examination of these works also reveals the startling fact that the higher a person was in the social hierarchy, more stringent were the rules guiding or binding him! And, this certainly is not a point for pointing the finger of accusation!</p>
			<p>Again, the dharmaśāstras in general, have all along maintained that any rule disliked by the majority of the people should be replaced by a more agreeable one. The principle of kalivarjya or āpad-dharma is a case to the point.</p>
			<p>After India gained political freedom, drastic changes have been made in the structure of general laws and Hindu Law, correcting many an imbalance of the past ages. In spite of this, if justice is not being meted out to the weaker sections of the society, the fault obviously lies elsewhere!</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;Ocean of dharma&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>For over two millennia, Hindu society has been guided and regulated by a special class of literature known as the dharma-śāstras. These works have prescribed rules of conduct for a person both at the individual and at the social level.</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstra literature has three aspects: the dharmasūtras, the smṛtis and the nibandhas.</p>
			<p>The nibandhas are digests containing a lot of information on various aspects of dharma and its application, culled from a number of authoritative sources.</p>
			<p>The <em>Dharmsindhu</em>—also known as the <em>Dharmasindhusāra</em> or <em>Dharmābdhi-sāra</em>—of Kāśīnātha Upādhye, is a leading and popular work especially in the Maha-rashtra State, guiding Hindu religious observances. It might have been composed during the period A. D. 1790-91.</p>
			<p>The book is divided into three paricchedas or sections. The topics dealt with in it may be summarised as follows:</p>
			<p>divisions of the year, the seasons and the times considered auspicious or inauspicious for religious and social rites; sacraments like upanayana and marriage; āhnika or the daily duties of a dvija (a member of the first three castes); śrāddhas or obsequial rites.</p>
			<p>It seems to have derived inspiration from another, better known, work called <em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> of Kamalākara (A. D. 1612).</p>

			<word>dharmaskandha</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;branch of dharma&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is an expression peculiar only to the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (2.23.1).</p>
			<p>&#x2018;Skandha&#x2019; means a division. &#x2018;Dharma&#x2019; means a way of life. The three ways of life mentioned are those of the householder, the forest-dweller and the Vedic student.</p>
			<p>The householder keeps and tends the Vedic fires, and, performs sacrifices. He also studies the Vedas to retain the knowledge he has already gained. Giving gifts to the needy is his another duty. He is the first dharmaskandha.</p>
			<p>The forest-dweller (as also the mendi-cant) is meant by the word &#x2018;tapas&#x2019; or austerity, because he leads an austere life. He is the second dharmaskandha.</p>
			<p>The Vedic student entirely devoted to the study of the scriptures and service to the guru is the next, the third dharma-skandha.</p>
			<p>According to this Upaniṣad, all of them (after death) go to puṇyalokas or heavenly regions attainable by religious merit.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This is a place of pilgrimage very popular among the people of Karnataka State. It is situated at a distance of 75 kms. (46 miles) to the east of the city of Mangalore, near the west coast. The river Netrāvatī flows close by.</p>
			<p>This place was originally known as Kuḍuma (or Koḍuma). According to the local legends, a pious Jain couple who lived here, were commanded by four dharmadevatās—Kālarāhu, Kālarakāi, Kumārasvāmi and Kanyākumārī—to establish a temple for themselves, which was done. Later on, a Śiva temple with a liṅga was also built. Sometime during A. D. 1513 Vādirāja (A. D. 1480-1600), a great saint of the Sode Maṭha of the Mādhva tradition, arrived here. He re-established the liṅga at the Śiva temple with proper rites and named the town as Dharmasthala. The descendants of the original Jain couple, with the surname Heggaḍe (or Pergaḍe), are the dharma-darśis (chief trustees) of the whole complex.</p>
			<p>The temple of Śiva—now known as Mañjunātheśvara—is the central shrine and the chief attraction of the pilgrims. The main doors are covered with silver plates. The four corners have four small kalaśas or pinions.</p>
			<p>The worship in this main temple is managed by the Vaiṣṇava brāhmaṇas of the Mādhva tradition.</p>
			<p>The following are the major festivals observed in this temple: Lakṣadīpotsava in the month of Kārttika (November); Gaṇeśacaturthī; Mahāśivarātri; Dīpāvalī; nine-day festival during Meṣa-saṅkrānti (in April) including rathotsava (temple-car-festival) and worship of Divine Mother during Navarātri (October).</p>
			<p>There are smaller temples dedicated to the four dharmadevatās and Aṇṇappa (a benevolent spirit).</p>
			<p>The huge stone image of Bāhubali, a great saint of Jainism, is another attraction of this place. It is nearly 12 metres (39 ft.) high and is mounted on a pedestal of 4 metres (11 ft.). It was installed in A. D. 1982.</p>
			<p>The large campus has several guest houses and excellent arrangements to feed the thousands of pilgrims that constantly throng the place.</p>
			<p>People of all religions visit this pilgrim centre in large numbers maintaining perfect peace and harmony.</p>
			<p>The management is running a large number of educational and public utility institutions spread all over the Karnataka State.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Dharmasūtras are the third aspect or branch of the Kalpasūtra literature, the last of the six Vedāṅgas (subsidiary sciences of the Vedas). Also known as the Sāmayācārika sūtras, they deal mainly with ācāra and vyavahāra (code of conduct in personal and social life) as also the varṇāśramadharmas.</p>
			<p>Though the Gṛhyasūtras and the Dharmasūtras are closely connected and the topics are sometimes overlapped, the former confines itself mainly to pākayajñas and saṁskāras (See <ref>VEDIC SACRIFICES</ref> and <ref>SAṀSKĀRAS</ref>.) whereas the latter, to varṇāśramadharmas.</p>
			<p>The following is a list of the Dharma-sūtras available now:</p>
			<p><em>Ṛgveda, :, Vāsiṣṭha Dharmasūtras</em></p>
			<p><em>Śukla Yajurveda, :, Śaṅkha-Likhita Dharmasūtras</em></p>
			<p><em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>, :, <em>Āpastamba Dharmasūtras Baudāyana Dharmasūtras Hārīta Dharmasūtras Hiraṇyakeśi Dharmasūtras Vaikhānasa Dharmasūtras Viṣṇu Dharmasūtras</em></p>

		<description>
			<p>Once, a brāhmaṇa who was an expert in archery, accidentally killed a sage and was cursed by him to be born as a butcher. He was reborn as the butcher Dharma-vyādha in the city of Mithilā. He was deeply devoted to his parents and served them with great fervour.</p>
			<p>Kauśika, a brāhmaṇa mendicant, was directed by a devout house-wife to learn the secrets of dharma from Dharmavyādha of Mithilā. When Kauśika approached Dharmavyādha, he was pleased to teach him the utility and the significance of performing one&#x2019;s duties in life, however unpleasant they may appear to oneself or to others. Such Karmayoga, as it is rightly called, leads to purification of one&#x2019;s mind and ultimately, to spiritual enlightenment.</p>
			<p>His teachings—which appear in the <em>Vanaparva</em> of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> (chapters 207-216)—deserve the name &#x2018;Vyādhagītā&#x2019;.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>In spite of the desire of an overwhelming majority of the people of the world to live in peace, wars have existed, from times immemorial. Recognising it as a fact of life and even approving of it in certain circumstances, (as in the case of defending one&#x2019;s territorial integrity or dharma) the great sages of India have evolved, over the years, some general rules to be observed during the course of a battle or a war. A war fought under these rules is a &#x2018;dharmayuddha&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The <em>Manusmṛti</em> (7.90-94) gives some interesting rules. They are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>One should not use poisonous arms or deceitful means.</li>
				<li>A foe in a disadvantageous position must not be struck.</li>
				<li> One who has surrendered must be protected.</li>
				<li> Those who are fleeing, the unarmed one, non-combatants or those fighting with others should not be attacked.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When Rāvaṇa was worsted in his very first encounter with Rāma, Rāma let him off to return alive to his place and come back after recouping and replenishing for another round. This is a glorious example of dharmayuddha.</p>
			<p>In the Kurukṣetra, the battle used to start after sunrise and stop at sunset. In the night the combatants moved freely in one another&#x2019;s camps enquiring about the health and welfare of their enemies or expressing their condolences for the dead! This was a part of the dharma-yuddha tradition.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;that which exists [in all]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This word is used in several senses. In the darśanas or treatises on philosophy it stands for the pañcabhūtas or the five elements, viz., earth, water, fire, air and sky (or space or ether).</p>
			<p>In the ancient medical sciences, seven dhātus which sustain our body (&#x2018;sapta-dhātus&#x2019;) are mentioned. They are: rasa (chyle), asṛk or rakta (blood), māṁsa (flesh), medas (fat), asthi (bone), majjā (marrow) and śukra (semen).</p>
			<p>Metals dug out from the bowels of earth like gold and silver as also precious stones are also known as &#x2018;dhātu&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>In Sanskrit grammar, the word means the root form of a verb, like <em>bhū</em> (= to exist).</p>

			<word>dhātuprasāda</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;by the grace of dhātu&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This is a technical term that appears only in the <em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> (1.2.20).</p>
			<p>While describing the nature of the ātman (the Self), Yama declares that he is smaller than the smallest as also greater than the greatest. He is established in the cave of the heart of all living beings.</p>
			<p>One who realizes him and his greatness becomes free from all sorrow and suffering.</p>
			<p>This is preceded by two conditions: to be akratu and to receive dhātuprasāda.</p>
			<p>To become an akratu or free from volition, the aspirant should avoid all desires and desire-motivated actions. Not being agitated thus by desires, his mind and senses which are called dhātu since they support the living beings, become propitious unto him. This is dhātuprasāda.</p>
			<p>However, the Bhakti schools of Vedānta interpret the word &#x2018;dhātuprasādāt&#x2019; as &#x2018;by the grace of Paramātman or God&#x2019;. So, the jīva or the individual soul is able to understand the greatness of God through his grace and thus transcends all sorrow.</p>
			<p>This verse is repeated in the <em>Śvetā-śvatara</em> (3.20) and <em>Mahānārāyaṇa</em> (8.3) Upaniṣads also.</p>

			<p>One of the important sages mentioned in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> is Dhaumya. He was the son of Vyāghrapāda and the teacher of another well-known sage (a great devotee of Śiva) Upamanyu.</p>
			<p>Being the royal priest of the Pāṇḍavas he had to play many roles in their life. When the Pāṇḍavas were banished to the forest he is said to have accompanied them. It is he who taught Yudhiṣṭhira (the eldest of the Pāṇḍavas) the rite of pleasing the Sun-god and obtain the divine vessel of food (known as akṣayapātra) from him. He was the chief priest at the marriage of Draupadī to the five Pāṇḍavas and also at the Rājasūya sacrifice performed by them at Indra-prastha. When the Pāṇḍavas lived incognito in the kingdom of Virāṭa, he protected their Vedic fires.</p>
			<p>It was again he who performed the coronation ceremony of Yudhiṣṭhira after his victory in the Kurukṣetra war.</p>

			<p>According to the Hindu scriptures, mokṣa or spiritual emancipation is the goal of life. This can be attained through yoga. Yoga may be practised in two stages: Haṭhayoga and Rājayoga. Haṭhayoga prepares the body by cleansing it so that it is free from all ailments where as Rājayoga cleanses the mind giving it the power to reveal or realise the Self within.</p>
			<p>Dhauti is one of the well-known ṣaṭkarmas or six purificatory processes in Haṭhayoga and is of four kinds.</p>

			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>The dhenumudrā is a pose of the fingers of both the hands, in the form of the udder of a cow, and is used during the offering of food to the deity. It is formed by crossing the fingers of the two hands in such a way that the tip of the little finger of one hand touches the tip of the ring finger of the other, and, the tip of forefinger of one hand with that of the middle finger of the other.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>When Drupada, the king of Pāñcāla wanted a valiant son who could kill Droṇācārya, his enemy, he performed a special sacrifice. Dhṛṣṭadyumna was then born, as an adult son, from the sacrificial fire. Draupadī too (wife of the Pāṇḍava heroes), was born out of the same fire, after him.</p>
			<p>He was a great hero and a good ruler. It was he who conducted the svayaṁvara—the rite of a princess of marriageable age choosing her husband from among the assembled princes—of his sister Draupadī where Arjuna succeeded in the contest and won her.</p>
			<p>Since Arjuna and the other Pāṇḍavas were disguised as brāhmaṇas, Dhṛṣṭa-dyumna secretly went to their dwelling place and discovered their true identity.</p>
			<p>During the Kurukṣetra war, he was made the commander-in-chief of the Pāṇḍava army. He successfully fought with many heroes of the enemy&#x2019;s army, like Droṇa, Aśvatthāma and Duryodhana. He beheaded Droṇa who had retired from the battle as per the sages&#x2019; advice. They had come to dissuade him from using the Brahmāstra.</p>
			<p>Dhṛṣṭadyumna was ultimately killed in sleep by Aśvatthāma.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>If Dhṛtarāṣṭra had not been born, the world would have suffered an irreparable loss; because, there would then have been no <em>Mahābhārata</em> and hence no <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> either! Born blind, he was impervious to the sage advice of great sages and savants, including his best well-wishers. His infatuation for his arrogant son Duryodhana was matched only by his hatred of the virtuous Pāṇḍavas. He was the very anti-thesis of what his name signifies.</p>
			<p>He was the levirate-son of Vicitra-vīrya in Ambikā by Vyāsa. Since he was sightless, he could not be made the king of Hastināpura. His younger brother Pāṇḍu was hence crowned as the king.</p>
			<p>He had married the eleven daughters of Subala, the king of Gāndhāra, of whom Gāndhārī was the eldest and the chief queen.</p>
			<p>When Pāṇḍu died prematurely and his children—the five Pāṇḍavas—were still young, Dhṛtarāṣṭra took the reins of the kingdom and arranged for the proper maintenance and education of the Pāṇḍavas also along with that of his hundred sons.</p>
			<p>When Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍavas was of proper age he was crowned as the yuvarāja (the crown-prince). Very soon, he became extremely popular with the subjects.</p>
			<p>Egged on by Duryodhana, the jealousy-incarnate, Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent the Pāṇḍavas to Vāraṇāvata for a &#x2018;change,&#x2019; where the former had plotted to kill them by arson. Due to the timely help of Vidura, the virtuous minister, the Pāṇḍavas escaped. Later on, they went to Virāṭanagarī, participated in the svayaṁvara of the princess Draupadī and succeeded in marrying her.</p>
			<p>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, on the advice of the grandsire Bhīṣma and others, called them back and gave them half the kingdom. The Pāṇḍavas started ruling it from their newly built capital Indraprastha. Their prosperity and popularity roused the jealousy of Duryodhana further, who managed to banish them to the forest by the well-planned stratagem of a game of dice exerting pressure on them through his father.</p>
			<p>When the Pāṇḍavas had fulfilled all their commitments and sent Śrī Kṛṣṇa as their emissary of peace, requesting for their share of kingdom or at least some means of maintenance, Dhṛtarāṣṭra pleaded his helplessness, unable to control or influence his son Duryodhana.</p>
			<p>On the one hand, he was afraid of the impending war. On the other, he was hoping against hope that his sons would come out victorious!</p>
			<p>After the war when all his sons and their comrades had been decimated, his anger, especially against Bhīma, manifested itself in a surreptitious attempt to crush him. However, Śrī Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s forethought saved Bhīma from the tragedy.</p>
			<p>Though he was looked after well, by the king Yudhiṣṭhira, problems of old age, repentance about past actions and the advice of the saintly Vidura induced him to take to the life of a Vānaprastha. He later perished in a forest fire.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Along with Prahlāda, Dhruva too has carved out for himself a permanent place in the annals of child-devotees in our purāṇas.</p>
			<p>Dhruva was the elder son of the king Uttānapāda from his first wife Sunīti. Enamoured of Suruci, his second wife, the king had completely neglected Sunīti and her son Dhruva.</p>
			<p>Once, snubbed by his step-mother Suruci in the presence of his father, Dhruva became despondent and approached his mother for solace. She advised him to pray to Lord Viṣṇu by performing austerities.</p>
			<p>When he was going to the forest, the sage Nārada met him and instructed him in meditation. After a severe penance, Dhruva had a vision of Lord Viṣṇu who gave him the boon of the kingdom. He also bestowed on him a long, happy life here and a permanent abode in the heavenly regions after death. That is now known as &#x2018;Dhruvanakṣatra&#x2019; (pole-star).</p>
			<p>Once, Uttama, younger brother of Dhruva, went to the Himālayas on a hunting expedition but was killed in an encounter with the yakṣas (a kind of demigods) who were the followers of Kubera. Enraged by this, Dhruva attacked them, killing them in large numbers. Kubera was forced to fight with Dhruva when Svāyambhuva Manu (the forefather of Dhruva) appeared on the scene and stopped the fight. Then the two became friends.</p>
			<p>Dhruva ruled his kingdom according to the highest principles of dharma for many years.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Pūjā or ritualistic worship is an important aspect of Hindu religion. The central part of it is the offering of upacāras. The upacāras are various articles ceremonially offered to the deity with appropriate mantras.</p>
			<p>These upacāras can be 5 or 10 or 16 or even 64. One of the upacāras common to all these is the &#x2018;dhūpa.&#x2019; It consists in lighting some incense sticks and waving them before the deity along with the ringing of the bell.</p>
			<p>Instead of the incense sticks, one can also wave lighted embers in which fragrant powders like loban have been put and cented smoke is being emitted.</p>
			<p>The method of smoke being used for curing certain diseases or for removing pollution from the atmosphere seems to be an ancient one, recommended in the textbooks of Āyurveda. The term &#x2018;dhūpa&#x2019; might have been derived from this practice.</p>

			<p>A flag or a banner called &#x2018;dhvaja&#x2019; fixed on a post is a common feature in Hindu temples. The post is called &#x2018;dhvaja-stambha&#x2019; and the flag itself is a metallic plate, either of copper or of brass. It contains the figure of the vāhana (carrier mount) of the main deity in the temple. For instance, if it is a temple of Śiva, the figure on the banner will be that of a bull (Nandi). If of Devī, it will be a lion. If of Viṣṇu, it will be Garuḍa (eagle-mount).</p>
			<p>The dhvajas or flags made of cloth are hoisted in temples temporarily on special occasions like brahmotsava and rathotsava. (See <ref>BRAHMOTSAVA</ref> and <ref>RATHOTSAVA</ref>.)</p>
			<p>The saṁnyāsins of some Hindu religious orders also carry a dhvaja on their staffs.</p>

Out of the 32 forms described in the iconographical works, &#x2018;Dhvaja-Gaṇapati&#x2019; (also called &#x2018;Dvija-Gaṇapati&#x2019;) is one. He is depicted as a fierce deity of the colour of full-moon, with four heads and four hands. In these four hands he is carrying a book, a rosary, a water pot and a flagstaff (daṇḍa with dhvaja). The name is probably derived from the last item.</p>

			<p>One of the essential parts of a traditional Hindu temple is the dhvaja-stambha or the flagpost. The actual temple, in the ritualistic sense extends from the garbhamandira (sanctum) up to the dhvajastambha.</p>
			<p>Since a temple is considered as the &#x2018;palace&#x2019; of God, the emperor of emperors, it must have a flagpost in front of it, in a prominent place. The lāñchana or insignia, made of copper or brass and fixed like a flag to the top of the post, varies according to the deity in the temple. The figure on the lāñchana is invariably that of the vāhana (the mount) of the deity. For instance, in Śiva temples it contains Nandi; in Devī temples, the lion; in Viṣṇu temples, Garuḍa and so on.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A stable and concentrated mind is a great asset in life. In spiritual life, it is a must.</p>
			<p>The art and science of concentration has been systematically described in the works on yoga. The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali (200 B. C.) is the most standard treatise on this subject.</p>
			<p>Patañjali describes eight steps to the attainment of yoga, of which dhyāna happens to be the seventh or the penultimate step.</p>
			<p>In dhāraṇā (fixing the mind on the object of meditation), the step prior to dhyāna, the concentration is not continuous. Moments of concentration are interspersed with moments of distraction. But in dhyāna, it is continuous. Each succeeding wave of the mind is absolutely identical with the preceding wave. Say, for instance, if a person is concentrating on the form of a deity like Gaṇapati, everyone of the mental waves carries the same impression or image of that deity. The mind is then flowing in an unbroken continuous stream like the oil that is being poured from one vessel into another.</p>
			<p>Dhyāna practised over a long period leads to samādhi (absolute concentration resulting in mystical experience).</p>

			<p>The Upaniṣad starts with an eulogy of yoga. Then comes a description of Brahman as extremely subtle and also as all-pervading. This is followed by a picturesque depiction of praṇava or Om, and meditation on it.</p>
			<p>Meditation on Vāsudeva (who is Brahman with attributes) in the lotus of the heart as also its fruit is given next.</p>
			<p>Then, the yoga of six steps (ṣaḍaṅga-yoga) comprising āsana (posture), prāṇā-yāma (breath-control), pratyāhāra (with-drawal of mind from sense-objects), dhāraṇā (fixing the mind on the object of meditation), dhyāna (meditation) and samādhi (superconscious experience) is described.</p>
			<p>A delineation of the cakras like mūlā-dhāra and the kuṇḍalinī power follows next. The five major prāṇas like prāṇa and apāna, as also the five minor ones like nāga and kūrma are also described.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;union [with God through] meditation&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Dhyānayoga is the technique of meditation. The ṛṣis who could not arrive at a satisfactory or convincing answer to their queries regarding the ultimate cause of the world, are said to have taken recourse to Dhyānayoga to realise it (<em>vide Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em> 1.3). In the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, the sixth chapter has been christened <em>Dhyānayoga</em>.</p>
			<p>The word &#x2018;dhyānayoga&#x2019; may mean the union (yoga = union) of the jīvātman (the individual soul) with Paramātman (God) through dhyāna or meditation. Or, it can be interpreted as dhyāna or meditation resulting ultimately in yoga or samādhi (perfect concentration) on God.</p>
			<p>The Dhyānayoga of the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> has the following steps:</p>
			<p>The yogi should select a clean and lonely place for his practice of meditation. He should then prepare his seat by spreading the kuśa grass, covering it with a deer skin and then with a cloth. He should sit on it, keeping the chest, the neck and the head erect. He must start the process of concentration by directing his sight towards the tip of his nose. He can then meditate on God, by withdrawing the mind from all other things.</p>
			<p>The yogi should incorporate into his life the following disciplines: fearlessness, continence, faith in God, moderation in eating and sleeping, and desirelessness.</p>
			<p>Such a yoga, when practised steadily, will result in great happiness. The yogi will then be able to see all beings in himself and himself in all.</p>
			<p>Though this yoga is difficult to practise, due to the fickleness of the mind, it can be achieved by abhyāsa (repeated efforts) and vairāgya (spirit of renunciation).</p>
			<p>If by chance, the yogi dies before attaining its fulfilment, he will be reborn in a family with a congenial atmosphere for continuing the practice.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In ritualistic worship as also in any ritualistic act, especially those aimed at fulfilment of desires, there is always a possibility of obstacles being created by inimical spirits. These spirits have to be &#x2018;locked out&#x2019; of dik (= quarters) during the ritual. The way of doing it is by chanting certain powerful mantras or mystical formulae like the vyāhṛtis of the Gāyatrī or syllables like phaṭ. This is called &#x2018;digbandhana&#x2019; or &#x2018;digbandha&#x2019;. After the ritual is over, the quarters (or dik) have to be reopened. This is called &#x2018;digvimoka&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The process may also be used to arrest the movements of those who are likely to harm a person, like criminals. Such use of extraordinary powers has been recorded in the lives of great saints like Tailaṅga Svāmin (19th century) and Vijayadāsa (A. D. 1682-1755).</p>

			<p>Expeditions by ambitious kings for conquering others&#x2019; territories or for collecting ransoms from them have been known to exist right from the most ancient times. Such expeditions were called &#x2018;dig-vijaya&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Kauṭilya&#x2019;s <em>Arthaśāstra</em> (12.1) classifies such digvijayas into three kinds:—</p>
			<ol>
				<li>dharmavijaya: Here the conqueror is satisfied if the defeated ruler agrees to be submissive.</li>
				<li> lobhavijaya: The conqueror is satisfied if he gets land and money.</li>
				<li> asuravijaya: This is the lowest and abominable type since the conqueror robs the vanquished king of all his possessions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The dharmaśāstra works condemn the last one.</p>

			<p>In the Hindu scheme of creation, as depicted in the purāṇas, the eight quarters or directions (= dik) have been put under the protection of eight deities. They are known as &#x2018;dikpālakas&#x2019; or &#x2018;aṣṭadikpālakas&#x2019;. They are:</p>
			<p>Indra for pūrva or east<br />Yama for dakṣiṇa or south<br />Varuṇa for paścima or west<br />and Kubera for uttara or north.</p>
			<p>The intermediate directions are taken care of by:</p>
			<p>Agni for south-east<br />Sūrya for south-west<br />Vāyu for north-west<br />and Īśāna for north-east.</p>
			<p>These deities are rarely worshipped. They are mostly represented on the central panel of the ceiling in the chief pavilion (mahāmaṇḍapa) of a temple.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Derived from the root &#x2018;dīkṣ&#x2019; (&#x2018;to destroy ignorance by giving knowledge and wisdom&#x2019;) the word dīkṣā has several meanings such as observing certain rules for a period of time, a rite to be performed at the beginning of a holy venture, like a Vedic sacrifice, the sacrament of upanayana, receiving a mantra (sacred formula) from a qualified guru and shaving the head as a part of a religious vow.</p>
			<p>Dīkṣā is a must in all ritualistic acts.</p>
			<p>Consecration of the sacrificer at the beginning of a Somayāga is also called &#x2018;dīkṣā&#x2019;. It takes place after some preliminaries like an iṣṭi and āhuti (offering a ladleful of ghee into the fire). The sacrificer has to wear a particular garment, a girdle of muñja grass and a piece of cloth as head-dress. He should also keep a daṇḍa as staff. His wife should wear a yoktra (a belt of muñja grass). They are expected to follow certain rules during the period of the sacrifice.</p>
			<p>Imparting a mantra to a worthy disciple is called &#x2018;dīkṣā&#x2019; in the tāntrik works. It is of several varieties. The guru can rouse the spiritual potential of the disciple by just a look or a touch. (See <ref>TANTRAS</ref> for details.)</p>

			<p>Vedic sacrifices (yajñās and yāgas) were very common in India during the ancient days. We find them mentioned not only in the Vedic and allied literature but also in the epics and the purāṇas.</p>
			<p>Somayāga is an important variety of such yāgas. Before a Somayāga is started the Dīkṣaṇīyā, a minor rite of the iṣṭi type (See <ref>IṢṬI</ref> for details.) has to be performed. The main part of it is the offering of puroḍāśa on eleven kapālas (pot-sherds) to Agni and Viṣṇu.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Dilīpa was a great king of the Sūryavaṁśa (the royal race which traced its origin from Sūrya or the Sun-god) and the father of Raghu who became even more renowned than his father. In fact, the race itself came to be known as &#x2018;Raghuvaṁśa&#x2019; after him.</p>
			<p>Dilīpa had no children. As per the directions of his (royal) preceptor Vasiṣṭha, he faithfully served his cow Nandinī (an offspring of the famous Kāmadhenu, the celestial cow) who tested him by creating a critical situation. Dilīpa came out victorious and was then blessed by the divine cow. As a result, he got a valiant son whom he named &#x2018;Raghu&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Dilīpa was also known as Khaṭvāṅga. He was once requested by the gods in heaven to help them in their fight against the demons. With his valiant assistance they attained victory. When they offered him a boon, he just asked them to know how much of his life was still left. On getting the reply &#x2018;one muhūrta&#x2019; (about 48 minutes) he immediately sat in meditation, concentrated his mind on Lord Viṣṇu and gave up the body, thus attaining mukti or liberation.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The religious works that regulated the conduct of the Hindus during the ancient and the medieval period, both at the personal and at the social level, are known as the dharmaśāstras. If the gṛhyasūtras and the dharmasūtras form the first stratum, the smṛtis form the second. Among the smṛtis, the <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em> is considered only next in importance to the <em>Manusmṛti</em>.</p>
			<p>These smṛtis needed explanations, amplifications and clarifications of doubts as the society grew more complicated. The commentaries written by later scholars well-versed in this field, supplied the much-needed material for this.</p>
			<p>The <em>Dīpakalikā</em> is such a commentary on the <em>Yājñavalkya Smṛti</em> written by Śūlapāṇi (A. D. 1365-1445). It is a brief work but quoted as an authority by well-known later writers like Raghunandana. His views have been considered as rather archaic.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In rituals as also in spiritual practices, mantras play a very important part. These mantras have to be received in dīkṣā or spiritual initiation from a competent guru or teacher.</p>
			<p>The special class of works known as the tantras declare that a mantra has to be subjected to a purificatory process if is to be effective. This process called &#x2018;mantra-saṁskāra&#x2019; is of ten types, of which &#x2018;dīpana&#x2019; or &#x2018;dīpanī&#x2019; is also one. According to one view, the bījamantra or seed-letter has to be repeated seven times with the praṇava (Oṁ) preceding and following it. This is &#x2018;dīpana&#x2019; for that mantra. For instance, &#x2018;Gaṁ&#x2019; is the bījamantra for Gaṇapati. In dīpana, &#x2018;Oṁ gam Oṁ&#x2019; has to be repeated seven times.</p>
			<p>According to another view the dīpana has to be done with the formula &#x2018;Oṁ hrīṁ śrīṁ.&#x2019; The details have to be learnt from the guru.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;row of lighted lamps&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Being a festival of lights, decorative illuminations and fireworks, Dīpāvalī or Divālī is perhaps the most popular of all the Hindu festivals, bringing joy to the young and old alike. It is celebrated very widely throughout India and among the Hindus settled abroad.</p>
			<p>It is very difficult to trace its origin and development. According to some scholars it was already a well-known festival by the time of the <em>Bhaviṣyottara </em><em>Purāṇa</em> said to be composed before A. D. 1000.</p>
			<p>In some works it has been called as &#x2018;Kaumudī Utsava,&#x2019; &#x2018;a festival in which people find delight on this earth among themselves&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Dīpāvalī proper is of three days&#x2019; duration; and with the addition of dvitīyā, it is spread over four days. It normally falls during the last part of October and the early part of November. The first day, Āśvayuja kṛṣṇa caturdaśī, is called &#x2018;Narakacaturdaśī&#x2019;. Originally, the celebration of this day may have been aimed at escaping from naraka or hell, by propitiating Yama, the god of death and hell. But later, it seems to have been associated with Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s killing of the demon Narakāsura, the king of Prāgjyotiṣapura (modern Assam). On this day one is advised to take an oil-bath at dawn, pray for the destruction of one&#x2019;s sins, offer tarpaṇa (satiation with handful of water mixed with sesame) to Yama and light a lamp to Naraka. After a sumptuous feast with fourteen kinds of vegetables (since the festival starts from the 14th day), rows of lamps should be lighted in the evening illuminating all parts of one&#x2019;s house. Temples and public places too should be illuminated in the same way. Some religious texts suggest that the day should be spent in fasting and that food can be taken only at night.</p>
			<p>The next day, amāvāsyā, is said to be the darkest day of the year. Oil-bath, worship of Lakṣmī, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, offerings to the pitṛs or departed manes, feeding of brāhmaṇas and fasting by day are the main items of the rite on this day. Lighting of lamps and general illumination should continue as on the previous day. Since this is a day specially dedicated to Lakṣmī and since there is every chance of Alakṣmī (the inauspicious goddess, the opposite of Lakṣmī) peeping in to ruin one&#x2019;s prosperity, women of the town or village are asked to create a terrible noise by beating drums and winnowing baskets around midnight !</p>
			<p>In Bengal, Kālī is worshipped on this day in clay image, instead of Lakṣmī, throughout the night. Hence this day is named Kālīpūjā day or festival.</p>
			<p>In other parts of India, this is traders&#x2019; day. They adore Lakṣmī, worship their account books, open the new account books, invite friends, customers and other traders and give them tāmbūla (betel leaf with betel nuts) and sweets.</p>
			<p>Next day—Kārttīka śukla pratipad—is known as &#x2018;Balipratipadā&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bali-pāḍyamī&#x2019;. It is one of the $3\frac{1}{2}$ days considered as most auspicious in the Hindu almanacs. Though there is unanimity in assigning great auspiciousness to Cāndramāna Yugādi and Vijayadaśamī, there are differences of opinion regarding the third. Some give that privilege to Balipratipadā while others do so to Akṣayyatṛtīyā. The left over day becomes the $\frac{1}{2}$!</p>
			<p>Worship of Bali (the powerful king of the asuras who was vanquished and pushed into the pātāla or the nether world by Viṣṇu as the incarnation Vāmana) at night, especially by the king, is the most important rite of this day. One should also keep awake the whole night spending the time in seeing religious dramas. Gifts made on this day bring inexhaustible fruits.</p>
			<p>On all the three or four days of the Dīpāvalī festival, the skies are rent asunder by the terrific sounds of bursting crackers. This bursting of crackers seems to be a universal practice all over the country. It may signify not only the expression of one&#x2019;s joy but also the destruction of evil personified by demons like Narakāsura.</p>
			<p>Balipratipadā is also called &#x2018;Dyūta-pratipadā&#x2019;. &#x2018;Dyūta&#x2019; means gambling. There is a curious (or queer?) direction in the <em>Brahmapurāṇa</em>, issued to those observing this day, to gamble! It seems that on this day Pārvatī defeated Śaṅkara in a game of dice and that she became very happy whereas Śaṅkara was distraught with sorrow. (This scene has been shown in the Ellora cave no. 21.) Hence those that win in the gambling on this day will be happy <em>throughout the year</em>, the opposite being the case of those that lose! This temptation naturally makes people—even today—to gamble recklessly.<aside>According to Dr. P. V. Kane (<em>vide History of Dhamaśāstra</em>, Vol. V, pt. 1, p. 203) the stakes soared up to three milion rupees in a small country like Nepal in 1955, on the Balipratipadā day!</aside> May be that the writers of these purāṇas wanted the flock <em>not to gamble</em> for the rest of the year! This is perhaps better than our modern contrivances like &#x2018;Courtesy Week&#x2019; wherein people think that they need not be courteous for the remaining part of the year!</p>
			<p>Some more observances prescribed during the celebration of the Balipratipadā may now be given. They are: worship of cows and bulls, worship of the Govardhana hill, tying of Mārgapālī and ārati to menfolk by the womenfolk of the family.</p>
			<p>Cows and bulls should be decorated, worshipped and fed well. Cows must not be milked that day and bulls must not be made to work. Obviously this is a way of expressing one&#x2019;s gratitude to those animals which do so much for us.</p>
			<p>Next is the worship of the Govar-dhana hill. The &#x2018;hill&#x2019; is prepared either out of cow-dung or out of anna (cooked rice) and other cooked food. This latter, as also its worship, is called &#x2018;Annakūṭa&#x2019;. An image or a picture of Bālagopāla (boy Kṛṣṇa) is also kept with it and worship is offered with 16 upacāras. The mantras used expressly refer to the protection that Bālakṛṣṇa gave to the people by lifting up the Govardhana hill and sheltering them beneath it.</p>
			<p>Mārgapālī (&#x2018;protectress of the road&#x2019;) is a rope of kuśa grass and is tied to a pole on one side and a tree on the other, in the afternoon. All people including the king and the brāhmaṇas bow down before it and pass under it. It is perhaps the &#x2018;goddess of the road,&#x2019; whose grace is needed to keep the town safe and also for safety during journeys. This is then followed by a tug of war between the men of the royal families and the common folk. If the common folk win, it is said to be good for the king and the country. Obviously, this is a symbolic way of expressing the simple truth that the ruler can be successful and the country well-ruled only when the people have a say in the affairs of the State.</p>
			<p>Next comes the festival of Yama-dvitīyā or Bhrātṛdvitīyā (Kārttīka śukla dvitīyā). According to an ancient legend, Yama, the god of death and hell, and the river goddess Yamunā, were brother and sister. On this day of Kārttīka śukla dvitīyā, goddess Yamunā is said to have invited her brother Yama to her house for dinner and honoured him. Hence, this day has become a day of reunion of brothers and sisters. Brothers are invited by the sisters to their houses and sumptuously fed. The former give presents to the latter. Since there is separation of the sisters after their marriage, from their parents and brothers, and may live in far off places or may not meet for a long time, this festival provides for a much-needed opportunity for a get-together.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, the sisters worship god Yama and pray to him for the longevity of their brothers. People living on the banks of the Yamunā river, do not miss taking bath in the river on this day. In some places there is a <em>melā</em> (fair) on the banks of the river.</p>

			<p>Diti and Aditi are two of the daughters of Dakṣa Prajāpati (lord of beings) married to the sage Kaśyapa. Daityas are the sons of Diti and āditeyas or ādityas or devas are the sons of Aditi.</p>
			<p>Once Diti requested her husband Kaśyapa to bless her with a son who could vanquish Indra. However, Indra came to know about it and managed to break the foetus into 49 parts. They were born as the Maruts, a class of minor gods.</p>

			<p>Divodāsa is a common name met with in the <em>Ṛgveda</em> as also in the epics and the purāṇas.</p>
			<p>Divodāsa Atithigva, son of Vadhr-yaśva, was a leading prince among the Bharatas. He was the father (or grand-father) of the famous king Sudāsa mentioned in the &#x2018;daśarājña&#x2019; or the &#x2018;battle of the ten kings&#x2019; (<em>vide Ṛgveda</em> 7.33.3 and 5). Śambara, the chieftain of the mountain tribes, was his great enemy.</p>
			<p>The son of Bhīmasena, the king of Kāśī, was also known as Divodāsa. His queen was Mādhavī and Pratardana, his valiant son, who vanquished Vītahavya, the king of the Haihayas.</p>
			<p>This Divodāsa is considered as a reincarnation of Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods in heaven, and the teacher of Suśruta (the author of the famous treatise on surgery, the <em>Suśruta Saṁhitā</em>).</p>
			<p>Another Divodāsa has been mentioned in the purāṇas as the son of Bharmyāśva and brother of the famous Ahalyā (wife of the sage Gautama).</p>

			<p>Vivāha or marriage has been considered as a saṁskāra (a purificatory rite or sacrament). It is one of the three most important of the sixteen saṁskāras, normally called &#x2018;ṣoḍaśasaṁskāras&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The dharmaśāstras (religio-legal works) of Hinduism have always considered vivāha as sacred and inviolable. Hence the question of divorce or remarriage of widows has not received much attention. Even then, in cases of mutual hatred with the possibility of danger to life and limb, divorce has been permitted.</p>
			<p>The husband or the wife can abandon the other under certain circumstances such as longstanding incurable disease, becoming &#x2018;patita&#x2019; or an outcaste due to heinous sins and so on. Even in such cases bare maintenance has to be provided to the abandoned party.</p>
			<p>After the passage of &#x2018;The Hindu Marriage Act&#x2019; in 1955, many desirable changes have been brought about in the system of marriage which include provisions for divorce also.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Though this word generally means &#x2018;divine,&#x2019; it is used in the dharmaśāstras in a more technical sense. When a king had to decide whether a particular person had committed a crime or not, especially when the evidence normally relied upon, like eye-witness accounts or strong circum-stantial evidence, was not conclusive, he could take recourse to &#x2018;divya&#x2019; or supernatural mode of evidence. &#x2018;Divya&#x2019; is defined as &#x2018;that which decides a matter in dispute, not determined by human means of proof&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The suspect is subjected to an ordeal and is declared innocent if he comes out unharmed. The <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> (6.16.1) refers to the ordeal of holding a heated axe in hand by a suspected thief. If he is not scalded, he is considered innocent and freed.</p>
			<p>Such divyas can range from two to nine. Some of them are: viṣa (administering poison), kośapāna (drinking holy water, used for bathing an image in worship), phāla (licking a red-hot ploughshare), taṇḍula (swallowing rice-grains specially prepared) and taptamāṣa (taking out heated gold pieces with bare fingers).</p>
			<p>The details of the tests are described in the dharmaśāstra works.</p>
			<p>Physical laws of nature are inexorable. How can they fail in such tests? For this objection the answer given by the writers of the dharamaśāstras is that even the normal processes of strong evidence have sometimes failed to prove the guilt. And, supernatural things, unexplained mysteries, are happening, even now.</p>

			<p>When saṁyama—dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi—is practised on the puruṣa or the individual soul, the yogi attains special supernatural powers, of which divyadṛṣṭi or ādarśa is also one (<em>vide Yogasūtras</em> 3.36). He is then able to &#x2018;see&#x2019; objects which may be extremely small or hidden by other things or at a great distance or belonging to a past time or a future time.</p>
			<p>Such siddhis or supernatural powers can prove to be obstacles to spiritual illumination.</p>
			<p>Lord Kṛṣṇa is said to have given divyadṛṣṭi to Arjuna before showing his cosmic form (<em>Bhagavadgītā</em> 11.8).</p>

			<p>The Viśiṣṭādvaita system of philosophy is also known as &#x2018;Ubhaya Vedānta&#x2019;, since it recognises two kinds of works (ubhaya = both, two) as equally authoritative. They are: the Sanskrit works commonly known as the &#x2018;prasthānatraya&#x2019;, viz., the Upaniṣads, the <em>Brahmasūtras</em> and the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>; the Tamil works of the Āḷvārs known as the <em>Divyaprabandham</em> or <em>Nālāyira Prabandham</em> (since they contain four thousand [nāl = four, āyira = thousand] verses).</p>
			<p>The Āḷvārs were Tamil saints who lived during the period A. D. 700-900. It is their mystical compositions that are known as <em>Divyaprabandham</em> or &#x2018;divine compositions&#x2019;. An &#x2018;Āḷvār&#x2019; is one who is deeply immersed in the love of God. Since these prabandhams or compositions were the spontaneous outpourings of their hearts, deeply immersed in devotional fervour, they are &#x2018;divya&#x2019; or divine.</p>
			<p>The following is the list of the Āḷvārs and their compositions:</p>

			<p>Total : 4004 pāśuras in 24 prabandhams by the 12 Āḷvārs.</p>
			<p>Since the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta considers the <em>Divyaprabandham</em> as one of the two cardinal scriptures, the philosophy of the latter is the same as the philosophy of the former. (See <ref>VIŚIṢṬĀDVAITA VEDĀNTA DARŚANA</ref>.) It can be briefly stated as follows:</p>
			<p>The fundamental tattvas or realities are three (tattvatraya). They are Īśvara (God), cit (the conscious soul) and acit (the insentient prakṛti or nature). Īśvara is the independent reality whereas the latter two are totally dependent upon him.</p>
			<p>The universe is evolved out of the acitprakṛti through 24 cosmic principles (as enumerated in the Sāṅkhya philo-sophy). The cit or the jīva—there are infinite numbers of jīvas—is bound in saṁsāra or transmigratory existence since beginning-less time due to karma, both good and bad.</p>
			<p>It is Īśvara who out of compassion inspires him to try for mokṣa or liberation. In this attempt for liberation, the jīva has to rediscover his relationship with Īśvara, which is of nine kinds: father and son; protector and protected; whole and part; husband and wife; known and knower; master and possession; supporter and supported; soul and body; enjoyer and enjoyed.</p>
			<p>The best means of liberation are: bhakti (devotion), prapatti (total surrender to God) and kaiṅkarya (service to God in his various aspects).</p>
			<p>The Āḷvārs seem to be more partial to the path of prapatti than bhakti.</p>
			<p>The <em>Prabandhas</em> contain profuse praise of the avatāras like Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, as also the deities in the temples like the ones in Śrīraṅgam and Tirupati, which are known as arcāvatāras and considered as fully living and conscious.</p>
			<p>Some of the pāśuras of the praban-dhas are chanted in Śrīvaiṣṇava temples daily as a part of the worship of the deity.</p>

			<p>The <em>Yogasūtras</em> of Patañjali describes the several supernatural powers that a yogi develops by practising saṁyama as directed by it. &#x2018;Saṁyama&#x2019; is a technical term signifying dhāraṇā (fixing the mind on the object of concentration,) dhyāna (continuous meditation on the same) and samādhi (perfect concentration resulting in supernatural or psychic experience) on the <em>same</em> object. By practising saṁyama on the relation between pure ākāśa (ether principle, called &#x2018;śabdatanmātra&#x2019;) and the organ of hearing, both of which being products of ahaṅkāra or the cosmic ego-principle, the power to hear sounds, even though they are subtle or at a great distance or separated by other objects, is attained. This is called &#x2018;divyaśrotra&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The same technique can be applied to other organs too, attaining similar divine powers pertaining to the eye, the nose, the tongue and the skin.</p>

			<p>The Holi is one of the most popular of the Hindu festivals and sacred days. Whereas it is celebrated as a day of revelry in all parts of the country, Bengal observes it in a quiet and dignified manner as Dolāyātrā or Dolpūrṇimā (the festival of the swing). This festival is said to have been initiated by the king Indradyumna in Vṛndāvana. It is spread over 3 or 5 days, starting from the śukla caturdaśī of the month of Phālguna (usually in March). A celebration in honour of Agni and worship of Govinda (Kṛṣṇa) in image kept on a swing (dolā = swing) are the important features. The fire kindled on the first day is to be preserved till the last day. The swing is to be rocked 21 times at the end of the festival.</p>
			<p>The day is also observed as the birthday of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya (A. D. 1486-1533) mostly in Bengal as also Purī (Orissa), Mathurā and Vṛndāvan (Uttar Pradesh).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Derived from the root &#x2018;duṣ&#x2019; (&#x2018;to contaminate,&#x2019; &#x2018;to spoil&#x2019;) , the word &#x2018;doṣa&#x2019; is used in several senses such as: fault, sin, vice, crime, disrespect, abuse, evil and deficiency.</p>
			<p>However, it is used in a technical sense too, in certain fields of knowledge.</p>
			<p>In literary compositions, doṣa can be of five types, pertaining to the use of the word or a part of the word, sentence, meaning and sentiment. They are respectively known as padadoṣa, padāṁśadoṣa, vākyadoṣa, arthadoṣa and rasadoṣa. These defects are sometimes raised to ten or even more. </p>
			<p>In tarka or logic, the doṣas are broadly categorised as lakṣaṇadoṣa (defect in implicatory meaning) and hetudoṣa (defect in the enumeration of causes).</p>
			<p>In the Āyurveda, the main constituents of health are the three doṣas or humours: kapha (phlegm), vāta (wind) and pitta (bile). If they are in a balanced state, health will be maintained. If they are disturbed, disease results.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;the seer&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>According to the various works on the Vedānta system of Indian philosophy, each one of us is actually the ātman, the soul, whose real nature is &#x2018;sat-cit-ānanda&#x2019; (existence, knowledge and bliss). This ātman has become involved and identified with the body-mind complex due to prim-eval ignorance which, however, can be annihilated by jñāna or knowledge. The process of discrimination between the dṛk or draṣṭā (the seer, the witness or the subject) and the dṛśya (the seen, the object) will help in ultimately isolating the ātman from the body, the senses and the mind.</p>
			<p>For instance, an external object is dṛśya and the eye is the dṛk. Again, the eye becomes the dṛśya for the mind which is now dṛk. However, even this mind becomes the dṛśya for the ātman, the conscious Self. There is none who is the dṛk for the ātman. Hence the ātman is the ultimate dṛk or draṣṭā. The draṣṭā who is pure consciousness continues to remain so eventhough there may be nothing to become dṛśya for him. For instance, in pitch darkness, in an empty room, though the eye is &#x2018;seeing,&#x2019; there is nothing to be &#x2018;seen.&#x2019; Similarly, the draṣṭā, the ātman as the ultimate witness is always the conscious subject or the seer and there is no loss of his consciousness irrespective of the existence or non-existence of objects to be comprehended by him.</p>

			<word>Draupadī</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;daughter of Drupada&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Draupadī, also known as Kṛṣṇā (since she was of dark complexion) (kṛṣṇa = dark) and Pāñcālī (since she was the daughter of the king of the country of Pāñcāla) was the chief queen of the five Pāṇḍava princes. She was, in a way, the root-cause of the fratricidal war of Kuru-kṣetra.</p>
			<p>She was born, along with her brother Dhṛṣṭadyumna, from the sacrificial fire of Drupada, the king of Pāñcāla. Since she was a damsel of extraordinary beauty, Drupada arranged for her svayaṁvara (See <ref>SVAYAṀVARA</ref>.) with very high stakes, in the form of piercing the matsyayantra (See <ref>MATSYAYANTRA</ref>). Arjuna succeeded in the feat and was garlanded by her.</p>
			<p>When the five Pāṇḍava princes who were then in disguise as forest hermits, announced to their mother Kuntī that they had brought an extremely precious alms, Kuntī who was busy inside the hut, commanded them to &#x2018;share it equally!&#x2019; When she actually saw the girl and realised her mistake it was too late! Draupadī was then married to all the five brothers. The sage Nārada came to the rescue of the brothers stipulating that she should live with each of them for one year by turns and that if any of the others saw her during that period, should go on a pilgrimage for one year as a penance.</p>
			<p>In the first gambling match with the Kauravas, Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍavas, lost his all, including Draupadī. Though she was humiliated, she was rescued by the divine intervention of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p>
			<p>The Pāṇḍavas regained their possessions but Yudhiṣṭhira lost them again in a second round match. This time they were forced into exile for thirteen years.</p>
			<p>After the exile period was over, when the Pāṇḍavas were in a mood to compromise with the Kauravas, Draupadī appealed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa to bring about the destruction of the latter through war. Śrī Kṛṣṇa did so. Her anger subsided when Duśśāsana and Duryodhana were killed in the battle.</p>
			<p>When Yudhiṣṭhira was crowned as the monarch, Draupadī became the queen.</p>
			<p>During the final journey of the Pāṇḍavas to heaven (known as &#x2018;mahā-prasthāna&#x2019;) Draupadī was the first to collapse. The reason given by Yudhiṣṭhira was that she was loving Arjuna more than the others, though she was expected to love all the five husbands equally.</p>
			<p>Draupadī has been considered as an aspect of the Mother-goddess and worshipped as such by the folk-cults of South India. There are numerous shrines dedicated to her in Tamil Nadu and Karna-taka, where an annual ritual festival known as &#x2018;Karaga&#x2019; is celebrated. The shrines also contain the icons of Dharma-rāja (or Yudhiṣṭhira) as her consort.</p>
			<p>Iconographically, she is shown as a beautiful lady with three eyes and two arms, the right one holding a lotus. The figure is bent in three places (tribhaṅga).</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>There are seven rock-cut temples in Māmallapuram or Mahābalipuram near Madras (or Chennai) on the east coast. They are generally called &#x2018;Rathas&#x2019; since they resemble a ratha or a chariot in shape. The Draupadī-ratha is also one of them. It is the first on the northern side.</p>
			<p>It is a simple cell, 3.3 metres (11 ft.) square externally, with a curvilinear roof rising to a height of 5.4 metres (18 ft.). The cell inside measures 1.95 metres in depth by 1.35 metres across (6.5 ft. by 4.5 ft.). On the back wall there is the figure of a female deity (with four arms) and her four attendants. There are also two dvārapālikās (gate-keepers) at the entrance.</p>
			<p>It is in Pallava style of architecture and belongs to the 7th cent. A. D.</p>

			<word>Drāviḍa</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>This word has been used in the dharmaśāstra literature in several senses. &#x2018;Drāviḍa&#x2019; is the name of a caste classed among the śūdras. Persons of this caste are supposed to have sprung from the kṣattriyas who had not undergone the Vedic sacraments like upanayana.</p>
			<p>The brāhmaṇas of India have been divided into two groups: pañca-drāviḍa and pañca-gauḍa. The karṇāṭas, the tailaṅgas, the gurjaris, the mahārāṣṭrians and the drāviḍas belong to the former group. Among these, the drāviḍas are also one.</p>
			<p>Among the three well-known styles of temple architecture, drāviḍa is also one, the other two being nāgara and vesara. The drāviḍa style is in the form of truncated pyramids and is more common in the region to the south of the river Kṛṣṇā.</p>

			<word>Draviḍians</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The question of the ancient people of India, whether they were the original inhabitants or immigrants, has always received great attention at the hands of historians, indologists, anthropologists and philologists. Several hypotheses and theories have been advanced over the last two centuries though no particular school of thought has been universally acclaimed or even gained a majority of adherents.</p>
			<p>One such vexatious question is that of the Āryans and the Draviḍians. If some say that the Draviḍians were the original inhabitants of India, driven to the southern peninsula by the invading Āryans, there are others who declare that they too were immigrants who came from the Mediterranean region much earlier than the Āryans.</p>
			<p>However, there is also another view that the Harappa-Mohenjo Dāro culture is the advanced stage of Vedic culture—and hence has nothing to do with the so-called Draviḍian culture—and that the Draviḍian languages like Tamil, Telugu and Kannada are gradual evolutions from the Prākṛt and Paiśācī languages which themselves were derivatives of the Sanskrit language.</p>
			<p>There has been so much of racial commingling and complicated evolutions of languages over the millennia that no single theory can be accepted as unquestioningly authentic.</p>
			<p>Since Agastya, the great Vedic sage, had been universally acclaimed as the originator of the religion, language and culture of South India (which later spread to the South East Asian countries also), suffice it to say that the Āryan-Draviḍian divide is more a conjecture than a well-established fact.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The word &#x2018;dravya&#x2019; has been used widely in several senses, including the technical ones in some systems of Indian philosophy. The general senses are: wealth, an object or substance, an auspicious one, an ointment, intoxicating liquid, medicine and bronze.</p>
			<p>In the Nyāya system of Gautama, &#x2018;dravya&#x2019; is one of the seven padārthas or fundamental substances in the universe. This &#x2018;dravya&#x2019; is of nine types: the five bhūtas or elements, kāla (time), dik (quarters or directions), ātman (the individual soul) and manas (mind).</p>
			<p>In the Dvaita Vedānta system, it comprises 20 items such as Paramātman (God), Lakṣmī (The Divine consort of God), jīvātman (the individual soul), prakṛti (nature), the three guṇas like sattva, buddhi (intellect), indriya (senses), avidyā (ignorance) and so on.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta recognises only six items under dravya. They are: prakṛti (nature), kāla (time), śuddha or pure sattva, dharma-bhūta-jñāna (knowledge as an attribute of the jīva), jīva (individual soul) and Īśvara (god).</p>
			<p>The substances like fuel-sticks of aśvattha (<em>Ficus religiosa</em>), sesamum seeds, pudding of milk, ghee, sweetmeats, coconuts, jaggery, honey and certain fruits—are also called &#x2018;dravya&#x2019; or &#x2018;homadravya&#x2019; and are used in homas or sacrifices.</p>
			<p>In the Āyurveda (health science) seven dravyas like vāta (wind), pitta (bile), śleṣma (phlegm), tvak (skin) and māṁsa (flesh) are recognised as comprising the physical body.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;sacrifice with wealth&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Yajña or the system of sacrifices is an ancient institution. According to the Hindu scriptures like the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (3.10) it was created by Prajāpati (father of creation) himself in the beginning as a link between the gods in heaven and the human beings here. The human beings have to satiate the gods like Indra through yajña and the latter in return bestow rains and grant other things needed by the human beings.</p>
			<p>Though Śrī Kṛṣṇa has accepted this basic system, he has expanded its scope considerably in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (4.25-33). It is in this connection that he has used the word &#x2018;dravyayajña&#x2019; (4.28). It is interpreted as giving money or things to worthy and deserving persons at the appropriate time and place, and, in an appropriate manner.</p>
			<p>The most important act in a yajña is sacrificing the individual good for social or universal good. In whichever act, such a spirit is seen, that itself is elevated to the level of a yajña.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>&#x2018;Snakes&#x2019; and dreams have come in very handy for the Advaita Vedānta philosophy to prove one of its cardinal teachings viz., the unreality of this world. If the &#x2018;snake&#x2019; in the rajju-sarpa-nyāya (the maxim of the rope appearing as a snake in insufficient light) serves as the proof for the absolute unreality of this world, the dream can help in proving its relative reality. Just as a dream is real as long as it lasts, this world too is real as long as we are under the sway of avidyā or nescience.</p>
			<p>However, dreams assume a much greater significance in other fields of knowledge like Āyurveda (health-science) and prognostication or futurology. Directions have also been given in them as to how to utilise them to one&#x2019;s advantage if they predict good things and how to offset them if they forebode evil.</p>
			<p>Dreams can be caused by physical causes like the disturbance of the humours (kapha or phlegm, vāta or wind and pitta or bile), past experiences of this life or the past lives. Depending upon the type and the time of occurrence of the dreams, the results are predicated. Dreams occurring in the first part of the night will give their results in one year, in the second part in eight months, in the third part in three months and at dawn, in 10 days. The result may be immediate if the person wakes up at once.</p>
			<p>If the person sleeps again after the dream or tells others about it, the dream will not give its results.</p>
			<p>Seeing the following in a dream is considered as auspicious: elephant, a king, gold, a bull, a cow, a lighted lamp, food, fruits, a maiden, an umbrella, a chariot and a flag.</p>
			<p>The following objects seen in a dream forebode evil: shaving of the head, nakedness, wearing dirty garments, falling from high spots like a hill, riding boars, asses and camels, killing horses, ascending a funeral pyre, falling of sun and moon, playing with goblins, plunging into oil or drinks, wearing red garments or applying red unguents and so on.</p>
			<p>The epics and the purāṇas contain innumerable verses on this subject.</p>
			<p>The remedies suggested to offset the effects of bad dreams are: performing a śrāddha like the one on an amāvāsyā day or reciting holy texts like the <em>Durgā-saptaśatī</em> or the <em>Viṣṇusahasranāma</em> or the <em>Gajendramokṣa</em> part of the <em>Bhāgavata.</em> Performance of appropriate śāntis (reli-gious rites to bring about auspicious results) is also recommended.</p>
			<p>The work <em>Adbhutasāgara</em> of the king Ballaḷasena of Bengal (A. D. 1168) is considered as a great authority on this subject.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Jyautiṣa or the &#x2018;science of light&#x2019; is an ancient science, the science of astro-nomy and astrology combined. Out of the several technical words used in Hindu astrology, the word &#x2018;dreṣkāṇa&#x2019; (or drekkāṇa) is also one.</p>
			<p>When a sign of the zodiac is divided into three equal parts, each part is called &#x2018;dreṣkāṇa&#x2019;. The lord of the first dreṣkāṇa is the owner of the sign itself. The lord of the second dreṣkāṇa is the lord of the 5th sign in question. The lord of the third dreṣkāṇa is the lord of the 9th sign.</p>
			<p>For instance, consider the zodiacal sign Meṣa or Aries. Divide it into three equal parts, each being called a dreṣkāṇa. The first is governed by the sign of Meṣa or Aries, viz., Kuja or Mars. The second is ruled by the lord of the 5th sign (Siṁha or Leo), viz., Ravi or Sun. The third is ruled by the lord of the 9th (Śani or Sagittarius), viz., Guru or Jupiter.</p>
			<p>The ecliptic (of 360&#xb0;) is divided into 12 Rāśis or zodiacal signs like Meṣa (Aries), Vṛṣabha (Taurus) and so on, each occupying 30&#xb0; in the same. It is this 30&#xb0; that is divided into 3 dreṣkāṇas, each dreṣkāṇa being of 10&#xb0; extension.</p>
			<p>The word dreṣkāṇa is said to be of Egyptian or Greek origin, the original word being &#x2018;decanoi&#x2019; (deca = 10). Each of these 36 had its own geni or deity, ruling over it.</p>
			<p>These terms and associated ideas have their own use in astrological calculations.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Bhīṣma and Droṇa or Droṇācārya were the two greatest warriors that fought for Duryodhana in the Kurukṣetra war of the <em>Mahābhārata.</em> Like Paraśurāma, his teacher, Droṇācārya too was a brāhmaṇa by birth, but a kṣattriya (warrior) by profession.</p>
			<p>Born as the son of the sage Bharadvāja, he got his early education, including the training in dhanurvidyā or archery from the ṛṣi Agniveśa. Drupada, the king of Pāñcāla, was a fellow-student. After completing his training under Agni-veśa, he once approached the king Drupada for financial help. The king in his arrogance humiliated him. Enraged by this, he approached Paraśurāma for higher training in archery and warfare so that he could take revenge on the king. After completing the same, he was, though by chance, appointed as the teacher of the Kaurava and the Pāṇḍava princes by Bhīṣma. Arjuna, of the five Pāṇḍava princes, proved to be his worthiest and best disciple. With his help, he got Drupada taken prisoner, usurped half of his kingdom and then let him off.</p>
			<p>Once, the Pāṇḍava princes discovered the hunter-boy Ekalavya in a forest by accident and found him to be a better archer than Arjuna. Ekalavya claimed to be a disciple of Droṇācārya himself. The latter then demanded and got his thumb as his gurudakṣiṇā or fee just to please Arjuna!</p>
			<p>Throughout the conflict between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, Droṇācārya too, like Bhīṣma, tried his best to advise Duryodhana to desist from his evil ways and make peace with the Pāṇḍavas. But his advice fell on deaf ears.</p>
			<p>In the ensuing Kurukṣetra war he fought fiercely, first under Bhīṣma and later as the commander-in-chief. Then as per the advice of the sages like Vasiṣṭha and Gautama, he retired from the battle and sat in yoga. At that time he was killed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the son of Drupada.</p>
			<p>Two more Droṇas are mentioned in the purāṇas. One was a Vasu (a kind of a demigod) who, along with his wife Dharā, performed austerities in the Gandha-mādana hill for long time to get the Lord as their son. They were reborn as Nanda and Yaśodā in their next life. Lord Kṛṣṇa, as their foster child, gave them great happiness and bliss through his childish pranks.</p>
			<p>The sage Śārṅgaka, the son of the sage Mandapāla and Jaritā when they had assumed the bodies of birds, was also known as Droṇa and was considered a brahmarṣi.</p>
			<p>Droṇa is also the name of a mountain mentioned in some purāṇas.</p>

			<p>Among the Vedic sacrifices, the Somayāgas are a class by themselves. The soma juice is the main dravya or ingredient to be offered into the sacrificial fire in these yāgas. The soma juice is prepared by crushing the soma stalks with stones. It is then strained through a cloth called daśāpavitra into a wooden vessel with a handle. This latter is called &#x2018;droṇakalaśa&#x2019; or &#x2018;duroṇakalaśa&#x2019;.</p>

			<p>Vedic sacrifices are an ancient institution. Out of the several materials used in the sacrifices for oblation into the duly consecrated fire, puroḍāśas or cakes made by baking pounded grains is also one. The two mill-stones used for pounding the grains are called dṛṣad and upala. Dṛṣad is the lower stone, flat in shape whereas Upala is the upper cylindrical stone.</p>

		<description>
			<p>All the systems of Hindu philosophy give importance to logic and reasoning, to prove their theories. One of the steps normally accepted by them is to give a &#x2018;dṛṣṭānta&#x2019; or illustration or example. Take this statement: &#x2018;The hill is fiery since it is smoky.&#x2019; The reason normally offered is &#x2018;Wherever there is fire, there is smoke.&#x2019; And the dṛṣṭānta or example is: &#x2018;the fire in the kitchen oven.&#x2019; This is an example of the positive type and is called &#x2018;sādharmya-dṛṣṭānta&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The same point can be proved by giving a negative example too. &#x2018;Where there is no fire there is no smoke.&#x2019; This is called &#x2018;vaidharmya-dṛṣṭānta&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>For a dṛṣṭānta to be valid, it should be acceptable both to the common man and to the philosopher.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Sṛṣṭi or creation of this world has been an important topic of discussion in all the six philosophical systems of Hinduism. Though the philosophers of the Advaita Vedānta school admit in general, of the existence of the external world and its creation—since the topic has been dealt with in the Upaniṣads—they do not accept it as a permanent reality.</p>
			<p>Out of the several schools of Advaita Vedānta in the post-Śaṅkara period, that developed by Prakāśānanda (A. D. 1550-1600) is also one. It is subjective idealism. His view of creation is known as &#x2018;dṛṣṭi-sṛṣṭi-vāda&#x2019;, the view that creation of the external object is simultaneous with its perception by the seer. According to this school, a thing existed only when it was perceived and <em>not</em> before or after perception. For example, a blue lotus and its awareness are one and there is no external object apart from the cognition. The dream state is purely mental and there are no extra-mental objects. Similarly in the waking state, the so-called external object is only a mental state and there is really no distinction. The whole world is thus only a psychic modification and has no reality outside the mind. This view is similar to the idealism of the <em>Yogavāsiṣṭha</em> and is perhaps derived from it. The Vijñānavāda of Buddhism is also almost the same.</p>

			<p>All living beings seriously try to escape from duḥkha or sorrow and suffering. An analysis of the causes of duḥkha and the means of getting relief from it often find a place in philosophical systems.</p>
			<p>Duḥkha has been defined in various ways by these systems. Some of them are: that which is characterised by pain; One of the qualities or states of mind that can be known by the reactions seen on the face; that which brings about hatred and so on.</p>
			<p>Duḥkha can be brought about by various factors such as: loss of freedom; mental tensions and diseases; sickness of the body; loss of honour; enemies; unhappy marriage; living in a bad place; serving a bad master; old-age; living in the houses of others, depending upon them and so on.</p>
			<p>Duḥkha has been classified in various ways by different systems. Here, the causes are given greater importance. For instance—those caused by: diseases, the six enemies such as lust and greed, tendencies carried over from previous lives, birth and death.</p>
			<p>Persons easily susceptible to jealousy, hatred, cruelty and a doubting nature are always subjected to duḥkha.</p>
			<p>Though appropriate remedial measures are available for these duḥkhas, mokṣa or liberation from transmigratory existence is the ultimate and the surest remedy.</p>

			<word>Durgā</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;the One [who is] difficult [to approach]&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Durgā is, perhaps the most widely worshipped aspect of Śakti. An entire Purāna, the <em>Devībhāgavata</em>, has been dedicated to her. Another work, more well-known than the <em>Devībhāgavata</em>, but containing practically the same material in a concise from, is the <em>Devīmāhātmyam</em>. It is also known as the <em>Durgāsaptaśatī</em> or <em>Caṇḍī</em>, and forms a part of another well-known purāṇa, the <em>Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa</em>. This work is so highly venerated that every verse of it is considered to be a mantra (sacred formula) of the Devī and its repetition is believed to confer whatever boons the votary prays for.</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>Literally &#x2018;Durgā&#x2019; means one who is difficult to approach, or, difficult to know. Being the personification of the totality of the powers of the gods, she is naturally difficult to approach or to know. However, being the Mother of the universe, she is the personification of tender love, when supplicated.</p>
			<p>Out of the several aspects of the Śakti put forward by this work, Yoganidrā (&#x2018;meditation-sleep&#x2019;) comes first. She is the power of sleep, taking recourse to which, Lord Viṣṇu rests between two cycles of creation. She is praised as responsible for the creation, sustenance and withdrawal of the universe. She is the mysterious power, the very personification of know-ledge, wisdom and memory. She is pleasant and beautiful. At the same time she is terrible also. This combination of the opposite qualities is possible only for her. She is described as wielding several weapons like the bow, arrow, sword, discus and trident.</p>
			<p>The next is Mahiṣāsuramardinī, the deity who took shape as a result of the pooling together of the powers of all the gods, who had been oppressed by the demon Mahiṣāsura. Viṣṇu, Śiva and Brahmā were incensed by hearing the accounts of the misdeeds of Mahiṣāsura and the Devī was born out of their wrath, followed by the wrath of the lesser divinities. The powers of these gods formed her limbs and the exact duplicates of their weapons formed her arsenal. Armed with these formidable weapons and riding on a fierce lion, she challenged Mahiṣāsura and destroyed him along with his army.</p>
			<p>This story is followed by an exquisite hymn which combines in itself both poetic excellence and devotional fervour and insight. She is the power inscrutable, by which the whole universe is permeated and energised. She is the personification of all wealth, power, beauty, as also virtues. She is the embodiment of yajña (sacrifice), parāvidyā (the highest know-ledge concerning the spirit) as well as aparāvidyā (knowledge of the secular sciences). It is she who bestows wealth—both material and spiritual—dispels difficulties, and annihilates the evil ones. Her beauty as well as her valour, is incomparable.</p>
			<p>The gods could not enjoy their freedom for long. Very soon, they were overpowered by the demons Śumbha and Niśumbha. So they had to run to the Himālayas and supplicate the Devī again. This hymn, well-known as the &#x2018;Aparājitā-stotra,&#x2019; praises her as the &#x2018;unconquered&#x2019;. Her immanence in all the living beings is the main theme of this hymn. The powers and activities of all beings are manifestations of only her power.</p>
			<p>In response to this prayer, she manifested herself as Kauśikī Durgā, emanating from the body of Pārvatī, who herself became Kālī the dark one, after this manifestation.</p>
			<p>The world-bewitching beauty of Durgā attracted the attention of Śumbha and Niśumbha who sent proposals of marriage through a serf. Unfortunately for them, in a moment of &#x2018;weakness and foolishness&#x2019; she had vowed to marry only him who would vanquish her in battle. All attempts at forcibly dragging her away ended in disaster for the demons. Heads rolled, the intervention of giants like Dhūmralocana, Caṇḍa, Muṇḍa and Rakta-bīja not withstanding. Kālī, the fierce black goddess who emerged from the Devī&#x2019;s forehead, beheaded Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa and thus won the name Cāmuṇḍā for herself. Only the battle with Raktabīja was longdrawn needing some special efforts by the Devī since he had the mysterious power to multiply himself through the drops of blood spilled in the battle. Even the Saptamātṛkās (seven Mothers) who came out of her body to battle, seemed helpless. It was Kālī who managed to spread her extensive tongue and drink away all the blood gushing out of Raktabīja, thus preventing the emergence of more demons and enabling Durgā to exterminate him. The rest was easy. Niśumbha was easily put to death after a mockery of fight. Śumbha being exasperated by now, accused her of taking the help of &#x2018;others!&#x2019; Laughing derisively, the Devī withdrew all her emanations and manifestations into herself, showing that she was always the One without a second. In the ensuing battle, Śumbha the lord of the demons, was easily killed, thus ridding the worlds of the great terror.</p>
			<p>This is followed by another piece of prayer, an enchanting poetical hymn, which is as simple as it is elegant. Known as the &#x2018;Nārāyaṇīstuti&#x2019; it starts with a fervent appeal to the Mother by the grateful gods to be benign and gracious. The hymn describes her as the mistress and the mother of the whole creation. She is the physical universe. She is the mysterious power of Viṣṇu (Vaiṣṇavīśakti), the original cause, as also the power that deludes beings. It is only by pleasing her that one can hope to get spiritual emanci-pation. All arts and sciences as also womankind, are her manifestations. She is residing as the intellect in the hearts of human beings. She is the all-devouring time. She is the very personification of all that is good and auspicious. She is ever engaged in protecting her children. The Saptamātṛkās are really her aspects. Kālī the terrible, with a garland of human skulls round her neck, is also another of her aspects. When pleased, she can remedy all diseases. If displeased, she can destroy all that we love and like to possess. Her votaries are always free from troubles. She is the Supreme Truth described in all the scriptural works.</p>
			<p>The work also describes her other manifestations like Vindhyavāsinī (one who lives in the Vindhyas), Raktadantā (of red teeth), Śatākṣī (of hundred eyes), Śākaṁbharī (sustainer of vegetables), Durgā (slayer of demon Durgama), Bhīmā (the terrible) and Bhrāmarī or Bhrama-rāmbā (having the form of bees).</p>
			<p>The Devī as depicted in this work has three major manifestations: Mahākālī, Mahālakṣmī and Mahāsarasvatī. These aspects should not be confused with the pauraṇic deities, Pārvatī, Lakṣmī and Sarasvatī. They are actually the three major manifestations of the One Supreme Power Maheśvarī, according to the three guṇas (tamas, rajas and sattva).</p>
			<p>The first, Mahākalī, has ten faces and ten feet. She is deep blue in colour, like the gem Nīlamaṇi. She is bedecked with ornaments and wields in her ten hands, the following weapons and objects: sword, discus, mace, arrow, bow, iron club, lance, sling, human head and conch. Being the personification of the tāmasic aspect of the Devī, she is also the Yoganidrā, who has put Lord Viṣṇu to sleep. It is to her that Brahmā prayed, requesting her to leave Viṣṇu so that the latter could destroy the demons Madhu and Kaiṭabha.</p>
			<p>She is the personification of Māyā, the mysterious power of Lord Viṣṇu. Unless she is pleased and voluntarily withdraws, the Lord in us will not awake and destroy the powers of evil which are trying to destroy us. This seems to be the import of the story of Brahmā, Madhu and Kaiṭabha.</p>
			<p>Mahālakṣmī, the second, the rājasic aspect of the Devī is described as red in colour like the coral. She holds in her eighteen hands the rosary, battle-pot, cudgel, lance, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup, trident, noose and the discus Sudarśana. Being &#x2018;born&#x2019; out of the combined wraths and powers of all the gods, she is the personification not only of the powers but also of the will to fight the evil forces. That is why she is shown as red in colour, the colour of blood, the colour of war. It is she who destroyed Mahiṣāsura.</p>
			<p>The story of Mahiṣāsura has several implications. Mahiṣāsura, the he-buffalo, represents the jungle law that might is right. He is the ruthless brute force that does not brook any opposition where selfish ends are concerned. And he succeeded even against the gods; but only when they were divided. But he fell before their combined powers and the will to fight, which is exactly what the Devī, Mahiṣāsura-mardinī, represents. The lesson of this story at the social level is too obvious to need an explanation. Nor can we ignore its social implications. At the subjective level, Mahiṣāsura stands for ignorance and stubborn egoism. Its subju-gation and conquest are possible only when the sādhaka (spiritual aspirant) pools all his energies together and fights it with a tenacious will. Since God helps him who helps himself, the intervention of the divine power in his favour is always there.</p>
			<p>Mahāsarasvatī is the third deity representing the sāttvic aspect of the Devī. She is bright like the autumn moon and has eight hands in which she holds the bell, trident, ploughshare, conch, pestle, discus, bow and arrow. It is she who manifests out of the physical sheath of Pārvatī and hence known as Kauśikī Durgā. She is the very personification of physical perfection and beauty. She is the power of work, order and organization.</p>
			<p>The section dealing with her exploits is the longest. Dhūmralocana, Caṇḍa, Muṇḍa, Raktabīja, Niśumbha and Śumbha are the chief demons destroyed by her. All these demons known as Asuras, are archetypes of highly egoistic people who revel in a life of the pleasures of the body and the sense-organs. Symbolically they represent various stages and states of egoism. If Dhūmralocana (&#x2018;the smoky-eyed&#x2019;) stands for the grossest state of ignorance and egoism, Raktabīja represents a more subtle state which multiplies itself and our troubles! While Muṇḍa is the low profile of our egoism (muṇḍa = the low), Caṇḍa is the more horrible side of it (caṇḍa = fierce). Śumbha and Niśumbha signify more englightened aspects of egoism (Śumbh = to shine).</p>
			<p>Dhūmralocana was destroyed by a huṅkāra, by a mere frown! Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa were too mean to be handled by the Devī directly. Hence Kālī, the horrible, finished them at her behest. Raktabīja required more skilful handling. The source of his strength was destroyed first before destroying him. As for Niśumbha and Śumbha, the Devī was obliged to give them a straight fight. Lower states of ignorance and egoism as typified by Dhūmralocana, Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, should be destroyed by sudden bursts of energy and rough handling. More crafty states which result in endless multiplication of desires—that is what Raktabīja signifies—should be tactfully handled by going to the root, by suppressing them as soon as they arise. &#x2018;Enlightened egoism,&#x2019; if one can use such an expression, which is egoism all the same, needs a straight fight. It may be a long drawn fight and Devī&#x2019;s grace is absolutely necessary for success.</p>
			<p>Aspects of Durgā mentioned in the Purāṇas and Āgamas are legion. For instance: Śailaputrī, Kūṣmāṇḍā, Kātyā-yanī, Kṣemaṅkarī, Harasiddhiḥ, Vana-durgā, Vindhyavāsinī, Jayadurgā and so on. They are of greater interest in icono-graphy and to the supplicants who can get different types of desires fulfilled by worshipping the different aspects.</p>
			<p>Images of Durgā can have four or eight or ten or eighteen or even twenty hands. The eyes are usually three. The hair is dressed up as a crown (called karaṇḍa-mukuṭa). She is gorgeously dressed with red cloth and several ornaments. Among the objects held in hand, the more common ones are—conch, discus, trident, bow, arrow, sword, dagger, shield, rosary, winecup and bell. She may be shown as standing on a lotus or on a buffalo&#x2019;s head or as riding a lion.</p>
			<p>Lion, the royal beast, her mount, represents the best in animal creation. It can also represent the greed for food and hence the greed for other objects of enjoyment which inevitably leads to lust. To become divine (devatva) one should keep one&#x2019;s animal instincts under complete control. This seems to be the lesson we can draw from the picture of Siṁha-vāhinī (the rider of lion).</p>

			<alias>Durgotsava</alias>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The worship of God as Śakti (Supreme Power) and as Devī (Divine Mother, Mother of the Universe) is as old as the <em>Ṛgveda</em> itself. Over the centuries it has grown into a formidable cult with its own philosophy, myths and rituals. The Durgāpūjā is undoubtedly the most important festival of this religious tradition.</p>
			<p>As in the case of many other important vratas and utsavas, the Durgotsava is both nitya (compulsory) and kāmya (optional). It may be performed for nine days or just three days (from Āśvayuja śukla saptamī to navamī ). Those who want to celebrate it just for a day, can do so either on the aṣṭamī or on the navamī day.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that the various gods of the Hindu pantheon, including Viṣṇu, are described as going to sleep for a period of four months (Āṣāḍha to Kārttīka). That the rainy season spread over this four-month period gave little scope to movement and activity or that the sun gave very little light to the Vedic Āryans living the northern latitudes, may have been the origin of this myth.</p>
			<p>Be that as it may, since Mother Durgā who goes to bed on Āṣāḍha śukla aṣṭamī, is still sleeping at the time the Durgotsava is planned to be celebrated, she has to be woken up first! This is called &#x2018;bodhana&#x2019; and is done on the evening of Āśvayuja śukla ṣaṣṭhī. A ghaṭa or kalaśa (a pot with water containing sandalwood paste, dūrvā grass, leaves of five trees like mango, clay from seven places, fruit etc.) is established under a bilva tree (<em>Aegle marmelos)</em>, the mantras of bodhana or awakening are uttered, and the bilva tree itself is worshipped as Mother Durgā. A second ghaṭa is also established there itself. Next morning (i.e., on the saptamī day), a small branch of that bilva tree is cut, placed in the second ghaṭa and ceremonially carried to the hall of worship where the clay image has already been established, and kept at its feet. After prāṇapratiṣṭhā, a detailed worship is done to the ghaṭa (in the presence of the image) with sixteen upacāras, followed by homa (sacrifice in a duly consecrated fire).</p>
			<p>The story goes that when Durgā (or Pārvatī ) came to her mother&#x2019;s house from her husband&#x2019;s home, it was late evening. So, she decided not to disturb her parents and spent the whole night under a bilva tree near the house. The ritual described above is symbolic of this.</p>
			<p>The pūjās done on the aṣṭamī and navamī days are practically identical with the saptamī pūjā. On all the days, snāna or bath is given to the sword or the mirror kept in front of the image reflecting it. Again, on all the days, ceremonial recitation of the famous work <em>Devīmāhātmya</em> (also known as <em>Śrī </em><em>Caṇḍī</em> and <em>Durgā-saptaśatī</em> ) is arranged at a suitable place in the worship hall. This recitation, especially on such holy days, is considered to confer great benefits on the performer of the pūjā.</p>
			<p>Part of the aśṭamī pūjā is the Kumarīpūjā, worship of a girl-child in the age-group of 2 to 10. She should be a healthy child unblemished in body and appearance. She is to be worshipped as the embodiment of the Devī or goddess herself.</p>
			<p>Another important  ritual is the Sandhipūjā, performed at the junction of the two tithis, aṣṭamī and navamī. The Devī along with the Yoginīs (various emanations of the Devī, 64 in all) is to be worshipped then. A bali (sacrifice) is also to be given.</p>
			<p>Though animal sacrifice has existed as part of Durgāpūjā, it is relegated as tāmasic (bad or evil), fit for people of lower culture and evolution.</p>
			<p>On the early morning of daśamī, the tenth day, the visarjanapūjā (worship signifying a send-off to the goddess) is done, symbolically withdrawing the deity from the image into one&#x2019;s own heart. In the evening, after a simple ārati (waving of light) the image is taken in a grand procession and immersed in a tank or a river or the sea. Much revelry is seen during the procession and afterwards, in the manner of the festivities of Śabaras (mountain tribes or barbarian tribes). In this Śabarotsava, as it is called, all people irrespective of their social status, were expected to join, probably emphasizing that all were equal before the Mother of all.</p>
			<p>The evening of Vijayadaśamī, after the immersion of the Durgā image, is an occasion of great joy for the people who meet their friends and relatives and warmly greet them.</p>
			<p>The Durgotsava described till now as the biggest festival, is mainly celebrated in Bengal, Bihar and Assam. However, now-a-days, it is being celebrated in the urban areas of almost all parts of the country, thanks to the concentration of the Bengali population there.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Vratas and utsavas (religious vows and celebrations) are an important aspect of popular Hinduism.</p>
			<p>The <em>Devīpurāṇa</em>, a minor work, refers to a Durgāṣṭamī-vrata, which has no reference to the exploits of the goddess Durgā like the killing of Mahiṣāsura. It is entirely different from the Durgāpūjā or Durgotsava.</p>
			<p>It is observed on the śukla aṣṭamī days only, for one year, beginning from Śrāvaṇa-śukla-aṣṭamī (the eighth day in the bright fortnight of the month of Śrāvaṇa, usually in July/August). Feeding of virgins and brāhmaṇas, apart from a worship of Durgā, is an important item of this vrata.</p>

			<p>This is a short, but well-known and popular Vedic sūkta. There are only seven mantras. These mantras, though forming a part of the <em>Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> (2.1-7), are spread over in the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, the <em>Taittirīya Saṁhitā</em> and the <em>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa</em>.</p>
			<p>Out of the seven mantras only the second concerns Durgā. The seventh is a prayer addressed to Indra. The other five are related to Agni. Yet, tradition has considered all the mantras as one unit and called them <em>Durgāsūkta</em>.</p>
			<p>Its recitation is specially recommended for overcoming the difficulties in life. It is believed that Durgā (the Divine Mother) and Agni (the deity of fire) protect us from internal and external enemies.</p>
			<p>The following is a brief summary of the hymn:</p>
			<p>May we extract the soma juice in order to offer as oblation to Jātavedas, Agni who is all knowing. May he destroy our enemies. May he take us across all perils even as a ship takes us across the sea. May he also protect us from all wrongs.</p>
			<p>I take refuge in her, the goddess Durgā, who is lustrous like fire, who is radiating power through her tapas (austerity), who belongs to Paramātmā or the Supreme God and who is worshipped by the votaries through various rites to get their fruits. Our salutations to you who is skilled in taking us across the ocean of saṁsāra.</p>
			<p>O Agni! You are worthy of praise. Through auspicious means take us beyond all difficulties, to the other shore. May our home-town and home-land become extensive and may the plot of agricultural land also be ample. Further, may you be pleased to bless our children and grandchildren with joy.</p>
			<p>O Agni! You destroy all our sins and take us beyond all troubles. You protect us just as one who takes a person across the sea by a ship. O Fire-god! Guard our bodies and be mindful of its safety like the sage Atri who always prayed mentally (for the good of all).</p>
			<p>We invoke from the highest place of assembly, Agni (the Fire-god) who is the conqueror of enemies, the charger of foes, and who is fierce. May he, the Fire-god, take us across all our difficulties and wrongs, and all that is perishable, and protect us.</p>
			<p>You are lauded in sacrifices. You increase our happiness. You are seated in the sacrificial place as ancient and modern sacrificer. O Agni, be pleased to make us happy, we who are your own selves. Grant us good fortune from all sides.</p>
			<p>O Indra! You are unconnected (with sin and sorrow). You pervade (all sacrifices). (Desirous of good fortune) comprising cattle and overflowing (with the current of immortal bliss), may we serve you. May the gods who dwell in the highest region of heaven delight me—practising loving adoration of Viṣṇu—here on earth by granting my wish.</p>
			<p>In some of the readings, a Gāyatrī-mantra of Durgā is added thus:</p>
			<p type="poem">kātyāyanāya vidmahe | kanyakumāri dhīmahi | tanno durgiḥ pracodayāt ||</p>
			<p>Its meaning is: We know Kātyāyanī (daughter of the sage Katyāyana). We meditate upon Kanyākumāri! May she, Durgā, impel our understanding in the right direction!</p>

			<word>Durgā Temple</word>
			<note>(of Aihoḷe)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>One of the more ancient group of temples, built out of stone and preserved as archaeological monuments is at Aihoḷe, a small town in the Bijapur district of northern Karnataka. The Durgā temple is a major building of this group. The temple derives its name because it is situated inside a structure that resembles a &#x2018;durga&#x2019; or fort and <em>not</em> because it is dedicated to the goddess Durgā. It is assigned to the period A. D. 600 and is of the Cāḷukyan style. The apsidal plinth resembles Buddhist caitya in architectural style. The vimāna (tower above the main shrine) is of the nāgara type. (See <ref>NĀGARA</ref> for details.)</p>
			<p>There is no image of any deity inside the sanctum. There is a passage round it meant for pradakṣiṇā or circumambulation.</p>
			<p>The pillars carrying the roof are rectangular in shape and are of a very simple design. The relief figures etched on the outer walls and on the pillars in the front include: Rāmā and Sītā seated in a boat navigated by Guha, Śiva riding his bull (Nandi), Viṣṇu, Narasiṁha, Varāha, Durgā, Garuḍa, Gaṇgā and Yamunā.</p>
			<p>There is reason to believe that it was a Vaiṣṇava temple.</p>
			<p>The stone inscriptions discovered here do not give any significant details or information about the temple and its builders.</p>

		<description>
			<p>In yajñas and yāgas (sacrifices), Vedic mantras are invariably recited. There are specific rules guiding their recitation. These include not only the modes of intonation but also of repetition. One such is the dūrohaṇa method mentioned by the commentary (of Devasvāmin) on the <em>Āśvalāyana Śrautasūtras</em> (8.2.12 and 13). According to this mode, while chanting a mantra the following should be the order:</p>
			<p>ascending order : First pāda, half verse and then three pādas at a stretch, followed by a pause.</p>
			<p>descending order : Three pādas, half verse, pāda and then the entire verse without a pause.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Dūrvā (<em>Cynodon dactylon</em>), a common variety of grass found all over India, has been considered as sacred and fit to be used in worship and other religious rites. After taking bath in a river or a tank, a little of this grass, with a small quantity of mud is placed on the head and some mantras (<em>vide Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad</em> 1.34 and 35) are repeated as an act of purification. In these mantras dūrvā has been praised as a deity.</p>
			<p>When dūrvā grows tall, it is called &#x2018;darbha&#x2019;. Rings made of darbha are tied to the ring-finger at the commencement of many a religious rite. It is then called &#x2018;pavitra&#x2019;, &#x2018;that which &#x2018;sanctifies&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>Dūrvā, considered as dear to the deity Gaṇapati, is extensively used in his worship.</p>
			<p>The works on Āyurveda sometimes mention three varieties of Dūrvā: nīladūrvā, śvetadūrvā, and gaṇḍadūrvā. Several medicinal properties are attributed to them. As such it is an appetiser, an analgesic, a purifier of blood, a remedy for skin troubles and a cure for diarrhoea.</p>

			<word>Durvāsas</word>
			<note>(&#x2018;[One who is] difficult to live with&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>If there was one sage in the entire mythological literature of Hinduism who was the very embodiment of anger and the propensity for cursing, it was Durvāsas. For this very nature of his, he was a difficult (= dur) man to live with (= vāsa). However, when pleased, he was capable of bestowing great boons too.</p>
			<p>He was the third son of the sage Atri and his wife Anasūyā, the paragon of wifely virtues, born as a partial incarnation of Śiva.</p>
			<p>He is sometimes described as the human personification of Śiva&#x2019;s arrow that destroyed Tripuras or the Three cities of the demons who were the sons of Tārakāsura.</p>
			<p>His exploits and feats range from the sublime to the not-so-sublime levels. They can be summarised as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Pleased with the maiden Kuntī, the daughter of the king Kuntibhoja, for her devoted service, he gave her a mantra with the help of which she could invite any deity and get a son from his grace. The five Pāṇḍavas and Karṇa were born by the power of this mantra.</li>
				<li>As per his direction, Kṛṣṇa smeared his body (except the feet) with the remnants of the pāyasa (pudding) eaten by the sage. This made his body (except the soles of his feet) invulnerable to weapons.</li>
				<li>He completed the half-done sacrifice of the king Śvetaki and enabled him to ascend to heaven.</li>
				<li>He tried to harm the Pāṇḍavas (when they were in the forest) at the behest of Duryodhana but was made to flee by the divine intervention of Kṛṣṇa.</li>
				<li>His unjustified anger against the virtuous king Ambarīṣa created a real crisis in his own life. He had to run for cover, being relentlessly pursued by the Sudarśana-cakra (the discus-weapon of Lord Viṣṇu). He was ultimately rescued by the king himself!</li>
				<li>He was responsible for the banishment and subsequent demise of Lakṣmaṇa by forcing him to go against Rāma&#x2019;s command.</li>

			<word>Duryodhana</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>It was the villainy of Duryodhana (also known as Suyodhana), the personification of greed and jealousy, and the inordinate attachment of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, his blind father, that led to the tragic war of Kurukṣetra, resulting in the total extirpation of the Kaurava race.</p>
			<p>At the time of his birth there were numerous ill-omens that made many a sane well-wisher of the Kuru-Pāṇḍava race, exhort Dhṛtarāṣṭra to abandon this evil boy. But the blind infatuation of this sightless father made him to ignore their wise counsels, ultimately leading to disastrous consequences.</p>
			<p>The Kaurava and the Pāṇḍava princes underwent their training and education, first under Kṛpācārya and then under Droṇācārya. The brilliance and the remarkable progress of the Pāṇḍavas roused the envy and the hatred of Duryodhana to such an extent that he tried his best to eliminate them by abominable means such as poisoning and arson. But none of his tricks worked, thanks to the timely intervention of Vidura and other well-wishers of the Pāṇḍavas.</p>
			<p>When the Pāṇḍavas along with their newly wed wife Draupadī, were given half the kingdom and they started ruling from their capital Indraprastha, their popularity and prosperity further fuelled his fire of jealousy. He invited Yudhiṣṭhira for gambling through a game of dice. Since the latter had a great weakness for it he readily consented, but was easily vanquished by the crafty Śakuni, the uncle of Duryodhana, who had substituted for him. The result was an utter debacle for the Pāṇḍavas who lost everything. Taking this as an opportunity, Duśśāsana, the second of the Kauravas tried to molest and disrobe the Pāṇḍava queen Draupaḍī, whose honour was saved by the divine intervention of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra then gave them back their kingdom and they returned to Indraprastha.</p>
			<p>Duryodhana contrived with Śakuni to have a second round of the game of dice with Yudhiṣṭhira. The latter lost in it his kingdom and was banished for a period of thirteen years. The first twelve years were to be spent in a forest and the last year incognito. If found out during that period, they had to repeat it all over, once again. Duryodhana tried hard to find them out and mounted an attack against them, then living in the capital of the king Virāṭa. But, he tasted a humiliating defeat. By this time, the Pāṇḍavas had completed their thirteenth year too.</p>
			<p>When they demanded their kingdom back, Duryodhana flatly refused, saying that he would not yield even as much land as would be covered by the point of a needle. Kṛṣṇa&#x2019;s last ditch efforts too, for peace, failed. Duryodhana&#x2019;s attempt to capture and imprison Kṛṣṇa was nullified by the latter&#x2019;s yogic powers.</p>
			<p>In the ensuing war, Duryodhana lost his all and ultimately died in a duel with Bhīma.</p>

			<p>Born as the second son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī, Duśśāsana was next to Duryodhana in age but worse in vulgarity and vileness. He laid the foundation for the Kurukṣetra war by dragging the princess Draupadī to the open court and dis-honouring her, after the first game of dice.</p>
			<p>He was defeated in his combats with the heroes in the Pāṇḍava army several times. Arjuna, Abhimanyu and Sātyaki had that privilege. He was finally killed in his combat with Bhīma.</p>

			<word>Duṣyanta</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>One of the famous couples in Hindu mythology who have attracted the attention of writers in Sanskrit literature is Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā.</p>
			<p>Duṣyanta was the son of Ilila and a scion of the famous Candra Vaṁśa. His first wife was Lākṣi or Lakṣaṇā.</p>
			<p>When Duṣyanta went to the forest for hunting, he chanced to meet Śakuntalā (the daughter of Menakā from the sage Viśvāmitra) in the hermitage of the sage Kaṇva. They fell in love with each other and married by the gāndharva rite. Duṣyanta left, promising to come again and take her to his place. He did not turn up even after five years. Hence the sage Kaṇva, the foster-father of Śakuntalā, took her, along with her child Sarvadamana-Bharata, to the king. Due to a curse the king had forgotten the whole affair and hence refused to accept Śakuntalā. However there was an &#x2018;ākāśa vāṇī&#x2019; (voice from the void) confirming Śakuntalā&#x2019;s statement thereby making the king accept her.</p>
			<p>Bharata succeeded him to the throne. It was his extraordinary greatness that made this country (India) go by his name as &#x2018;Bharatakhaṇḍa&#x2019; or &#x2018;Bharatavarṣa&#x2019;</p>
			<p>Kālidāsa&#x2019;s famous work <em>Abhijñāna-Śākuntalam</em> is based on this story of Duṣyanta.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>The Dvādaśāha is a Vedic sacrifice belonging to the Somayāga group. It is called so since it extends over twelve (= dvādaśa) days. It can be either an ahīna (spread over several days) or a sattra (where the yajamānas themselves are the priests too).</p>
			<p>It comprises Daśāha (ten principle days) preceded and followed by an Atirātra. (See <ref>ATIRĀTRA</ref>.) The Daśāha again has a few minor Soma sacrifices like the Pṛṣṭhya and the Ukthya. The details are too many and complicated.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Among the Hindu festivals and sacred days—which are generally celebrated according to the cāndramāna or lunar calendar—ekādaśī and dvādaśī (the eleventh and the twelfth days) are the more common ones, ceremonially observed.</p>
			<p>Dvādaśī is the day following ekādaśī and hence known for pāraṇā, ceremonial breaking of the fast, which includes worship of Viṣṇu, celibacy, avoiding a second meal as also non-vegetarian food. Some of the purāṇas specially mention eight kinds of dvādaśīs like Jayā, Vijayā, Jayantī and Pāpanāśinī, associated with certain nakṣatras (asterisms). Fasting is enjoined for these days also.</p>
			<p>One of the most well-known festivals that falls on a dvādaśī is the Utthāna-dvādaśī (Kārttīka śukla dvādaśī ). On this day Lord Viṣṇu who had gone to sleep on the Śayanī day (Āṣāḍha śukla ekādaśī ), gets up. Hence it is called &#x2018;Utthānadvādaśī (utthāna = getting up).</p>
			<p>It is again on this day that Tulasī or Vṛndā was married to Hari or Viṣṇu. So, it is also called &#x2018;Tulasīvivāha day.&#x2019; Ceremonial marriage of the Tulasī plant (holy basil) with Lord Hari is performed on this day. In some houses images of Hari and Tulasī are kept for three days (from the navamī to ekādaśī) and worshipped. They are married on the dvādaśī day.</p>
			<p>Vaikuṇṭha-dvādaśī or Mukkoṭi-dvādaśī is another festival observed in the South. It is the next day of Vaikuṇṭha Ekādaśī. Details of the festival are the same as for the Ekādaśī.</p>

			<p>Any school of Hindu philosophy which believes that the ultimate Reality is not one but many, can be called &#x2018;dvaita&#x2019;. The chief system of dvaita is the Dvaita Vedānta Darśana propagated by Madhvācārya (A. D. 1238-1317). The other schools are:</p>

			<word>Dvaitādvaita</word>
			<note>(of Nimbārka)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Nimbārka lived in the latter half of the 12th century. His Dvaitādvaita is very similar to the Bhedābheda of Bhāskara. However, being a firm believer in Brahman with form and attributes and the path of devotion, his philosophy is more akin to that of Rāmānuja.</p>
			<p>Nimbārka&#x2019;s main work is <em>Vedānta-pārijātasaurabha</em> which is his commentary on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>. It is rather brief but lucid, since he avoids the dialectical methods or a flowery style.</p>
			<p>According to him there are three equally real and co-eternal tattvas or principles: Brahman, cit and acit. While Brahman is the controller or niyantṛ, cit (the sentient being, the jīva or the soul) is the enjoyer, bhoktṛ, and acit (the insentient nature, prakṛti) is the enjoyed, bhogya.</p>
			<p>Acit is of three kinds: prākṛta or what is derived from prakṛti or primal matter; aprākṛta or what is not derived from prakṛti, but derived from a non-material substance of which the world of Brahman is made and, kāla or time.</p>
			<p>They are different from one another in their svarūpa or nature. But the cit and the acit are paratantra-tattvas, dependent realities.</p>
			<p>Nimbārka adopts the view that the bheda (difference) and the abheda (non-difference) are both equally real. They coexist but do not contradict each other. It is something like the relationship between the sea and its waves or the sun and its rays. Cit and acit, the souls and the universe, exist in Brahman from all eternity and never get separated from him whether in the causal state or when manifested.</p>
			<p>They retain their individuality even during salvation, or dissolution of the universe.</p>
			<p>Brahman is personal, possesses a celestial body full of exquisite beauty and grace. Nimbārka identifies him with Kṛṣṇa and posits Rādhā as his Śakti or consort even as Rāmānuja accepts Lakṣmī as the consort of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa.</p>
			<p>Brahman is omniscient, the cause of the origin, sustenance and destruction of the universe. He is all-powerful and yet all-merciful. He is gracious to his devotees and helps them have a direct vision of himself.</p>
			<p>The jīvas are atomic and infinite in number. Each of them is a distinctive agent, a jñātṛ (knower), kartṛ (doer) and bhoktṛ (enjoyer) of the karmas he does. They animate the body they live in, even as a small lamp kept in a room lights up the whole room.</p>
			<p>There are three destinies for the jīvas—naraka or hell for the sinners, svarga or heaven for the virtuous and apavarga or release for the enlightened ones. Apavarga is attaining the world of Brahman from which there is no return.</p>
			<p>Constant meditation on Brahman as the inmost self of the jīva or the individual soul is the means of attaining Brahman in Brahmaloka. There he has brahma-svarūpa-lābha, becomes similar to him in nature, except for the power of creation.</p>
			<p>The other sādhanas recommended are: scripture-ordained work, knowledge, devotion and surrender to God, as also strict obedience to the spiritual teacher.</p>

			<word>Dvaita Vedānta Darśana</word>
			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
			<p>The Vedānta-darśana, the last of the six well-known systems of Indian philosophy, has three main branches: Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita. The Dvaita Vedānta system, vigorously propounded and propagated by Madhva<aside>He was also known as Ānanda-tīrtha and Pūrṇa-prajña.</aside> (A. D. 1238-1317) is the most powerful reaction to the extreme idealism of Advaita as taught by Śaṅkara (A. D. 788-820) and his followers. The division of reality into two tiers viz., the vyāvahārika (empirical) and the pāramārthika (absolute), the doctrines of Nirviśeṣa-brahman (attributeless Supreme Being) and mithyātva (falsity) of the objective world as asserted by the Advaitins, have all received a very severe treatment at the hands of the dualistic philosophers, especially Madhva.</p>
			<h3>DVAITA LITERATURE</h3>
			<p>Contrary to the general understanding, the literature on the dvaita philosophy of Madhva is quite extensive. Madhva has to his credit 37 works in all, generally known as <em> Sarvamūlagrantha</em>. Apart from the commentaries on the ten Upaniṣads and the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, he has left three treatises on the <em>Brahmasūtras</em>: <em>Brahmasūtrabhāṣya</em>, <em>Aṇubhāṣya</em> and <em>Anuvyākhyāna</em>. Some of the other works that may be mentioned are: a special class of literature known as the <em>Tātparya-nirṇaya</em> on the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, the <em>Mahā-bhārata</em> and the <em>Bhāgavata</em>; <em>Viṣṇutattva-vinirṇaya</em>, <em>Ṛgbhāṣya</em> and <em>Māyāvāda-khaṇḍana</em>.</p>
			<p>Some more important works of this school are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>By Jayatīrtha (13th century A. D.):—<em> Nyāyasudhā</em> (on the <em>Anuvyākhyāna</em>), <em>Tattvaprakāśikā</em> (on the <em>Brahma-sūtrabhāṣya</em>), <em>Nyāyadīpikā</em> (on the <em>Gītā-tātparyanirṇaya</em>) and <em>Prameya-dīpikā</em> (on the <em>Gītābhāṣya</em>).</li>
				<li>By Vyāsatīrtha, also known as Vyāsa-rāya (A. D. 1447-1539):—<em>Nyāyāmṛta</em>, <em>Tarkatāṇḍava</em> and <em>Candrikā</em>.</li>
				<li>By Rāghavendra (A. D. 1598-1671):—<em>Nyāyasudhāparimaḷā</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>PHILOSOPHY</h3>
			<p>Generally, the Indian systems of philosophy discuss their subject under four broad categories: pramāṇa (means of knowledge), prameya (what is to be ascertained by the pramāṇas), sādhanās (spiritual practices) and mokṣa (liberation from transmigratory existence).</p>
			<h2>PRAMĀṆAS</h2>
			<p>Like most of the other schools, the Dvaita Vedānta of Madhva, accepts the three pramāṇas viz., pratyakṣa (direct perception), anumāna (inference) and śabda, śruti or āgama (scriptural testimony). However, it gives very great importance to pratyakṣa as far as the things of this world are concerned. It never concedes that this world of sensory experi-ence is mithyā (illusion) since it has been a universal and direct experience. This direct experience attains certainty due to its being illumined by the energy of the jīva (the individual soul) called sākṣī in this system. The analogy of the snake being perceived in a rope in semi-darkness cannot be extended to this world-experience since that snake never existed and was only an illusory perception and hence, it was sublated by the later, correct, perception of the rope. This &#x2018;khyāti&#x2019; or the theory of illusory perception has been named here as &#x2018;abhinava-anyathākhyāti&#x2019; (&#x2018;ultra-new theory of false perception&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>However, as far as the things beyond the ken of our sensory perceptions and inferences based on them are concerned, the śabda or the scripture (the Veda) is our ultimate authority. It is true that the Upaniṣads contain statements which support the theory of Brahman, the Absolute, being attributeless and also his being a Person (God) with infinitely great and auspicious qualities. Whereas the Advaita Vedānta treats the former as the main import of these statements and gives a lower status to Personal God in its two tier theory of vyāvahārika-satya (the empirical reality) and pāramārthika-satya (the absolute Reality), the Dvaita Vedānta of Madhva considers the latter as the main import and the former as supporting the same in a round-about way. The latter texts are called &#x2018;upajīvya&#x2019; (basic) and the former as &#x2018;upajīvaka&#x2019; (dependent or expla-natory). Since the world of multiplicity is a fact of universal experience, certified by the sākṣī, its denial by the upajīvaka texts should be construed rather in a symbolic way, as just asserting the unity of the many in the one (God, the absolutely independent Reality on whom all the other categories depend). This assertion of the unity must needs presuppose the many!</p>
			<h2>PRAMEYAS</h2>
			<p>Coming to the prameyas, the following ten are the ultimate categories as accepted by this system: dravya (substance), guṇa (quality), karma (action), sāmānya (class character), viśeṣa (particularity), viśiṣṭa (the qualified), aṁśī (the whole), śakti (power), sādṛśya (similarity) and abhāva (negation).</p>
			<p>Dravya or substance is the substratum of attributes and the material cause of evolution of some entities like prakṛti and the emanation in others like Brahman and the jīva.</p>
			<p>Dravya, again, is of six types: Brahman or Viṣṇu (God), Lakṣmī (Consort of God), jīvas (individual souls), avyākṛta-ākāśa (unmodified space), prakṛti (the insentient material cause) and the three guṇas (sattva, rajas and tamas).</p>
			<p>A more detailed treatment of these can be taken up later.</p>
			<p>Guṇas are attributes. They are countless. They may be physical, mental or spiritual. But they always depend on the substances they qualify. God, however, is never touched by the bad guṇas.</p>
			<p>Karma or action is of two kinds: puṇya (meritorious) and pāpa (sinful). They are responsible for the pleasant and the painful experiences of the jīvas.</p>
			<p>Sāmānya or universal is that property by which we see something common in a plurality of objects, as for instance &#x2018;tableness&#x2019; in several tables, which are all different individual pieces.</p>
			<p>Viśeṣa (particularity), translated more often as &#x2018;difference-identity&#x2019; by the Mādhva scholars, is a special contribution of Madhva to the group of categories. When we say that we see a table, it also means that we see it as different from the floor on which it is placed. Again, we also see it as different from all other objects. There is only one process of knowing involved in the perception of both the entity as such and its difference from all others. This is viśeṣa, the self-linking capacity of substances, that enables them to assimilate the attributes into their very nature without obstructing the capacity of the attributes to display themselves. For instance, a ripe mango has several attributes: red colour, softness, sweet taste and a flavour of its own. This substance mango is not only identified with them but also different from them. Not only that, even these several attributes are different from one another. This special quality of the substance, of being different and also being identified with the attributes is <em>inherent</em> to it and is called &#x2018;saviśeṣa-abheda&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The viśiṣṭa or the qualified, is the &#x2018;thing-in-itself&#x2019; (viśeṣya) with the qualifying adjuncts (viśeṣaṇas), seen together in a single perception as one. The subtraction or addition of any viśeṣaṇa will produce a <em>new</em> viśiṣṭa. Hence the whole is something <em>more</em> than its parts.</p>
			<p>Aṁśī is the entity that has aṁśas or fractions or parts. A cloth is an aṁśī whereas its threads are its aṁśas. Incarnations of God are called &#x2018;svarūpāṁśa&#x2019; (a fraction of potency) whereas the jīvas are termed as &#x2018;bhinnāṁśa&#x2019; (a potency in separation).</p>
			<p>Śakti is the capacity or power and is said to be of four kinds: Brahman&#x2019;s capacity beyond human comprehension, induced power as in consecrated images, the super-sensory power in causes that helps them to produce their effects and the power of words to produce their meanings.</p>
			<p>Sādṛśya is resemblance or similarity. After seeing one cow, when we see another, we see not only a new cow but also the resemblance between the two. Since resemblance as such cannot reside in either of the cows, it must be recognised as a separate category.</p>
			<p>Abhāva or negation, though not positive, is considered as a category in this system. The four varieties—same as accepted by the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika-system—are: prāgabhāva (perception of non-existence before a thing is produced), pradhvaṁsā-bhāva (perception of its absence after it is destroyed), anyonyā-bhāva (perception of the mutual non-existence of one thing in another) and atyantābhāva (absolute non-existence). The absence of a pot before its production and after its destruction is the example for the first two abhāvas. The reciprocal negation between a jar and a cloth is the example for the third. The &#x2018;son of a barren woman&#x2019; or the &#x2018;horns of a hare&#x2019; are the illustrations for the last.</p>
			<h3>THEOLOGY</h3>
			<p>The doctrine of pañcabhedas or five-fold differences is fundamental to the dvaita philosophy of Madhva. According to this doctrine, Brahman is different from the jīvas, and the prakṛti, the jīvas are different from one another and from the prakṛti, and, the various objects evolved out of prakṛti are also different from one another.</p>
			<h2>BRAHMAN OR GOD</h2>
			<p>Dvaita metaphysics divides the ultimate categories into two groups: the svatantra (absolutely free Reality) and the asvatantra (the dependent reality). Brahman or God alone is svatantra and all the others—Lakṣmī (God&#x2019;s consort), the jīvas or the individual souls and prakṛti or nature—are asvatantra. Though God does not create them (they being coeval with him) he is their absolute master and controller both from within and from without.</p>
			<p>God is personal, but has no physical body, no anthropomorphic form. He is all-pervading. He is Viṣṇu, also called Hari, Nārāyaṇa, Puruṣottama, Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva and by several other names. He is not only the creator and destroyer of the universe but also the controller in each and everyone of its aspects. He is full of infinite, auspicious, attributes as described in the scriptures. He is the quintessence of all perfection. No imperfection in the asvatantra categories can ever touch him. Māyā is his acintyaśakti (inconceivable power) by which he performs all cosmic activities like creation, sustenance, dissolution, control, enlightenment, obscuration, bondage and release of the souls. Grace is one of the most important of his attributes that helps a jīva devoted to him, to be redeemed. He can incarnate himself as avatāras. All the avatāras are equal, though the manifestation of his power may be different in them.</p>
			<p>The Vedas are the only source of information about God. Though he can be apprehended by them, he can never be comprehended. The authority of secondary scriptures like the <em>Mahābhārata</em> and the purāṇas should also be accepted since they too are works of Vyāsa, the editor of the Vedas.</p>
			<h2>LAKṢMĪ</h2>
			<p>Lakṣmī, represented as the consort of Viṣṇu, is the foremost among the conscious entities. Though absolutely dependent upon him, she has no bondage and is co-eval with the independent Viṣṇu and is hence called &#x2018;Samānā&#x2019; (his equal).</p>
			<p>Like Viṣṇu she is omnipresent and has no material form. But she can manifest in infinite forms. Viṣṇu has bestowed on her, his own cosmic powers, through which she can control the destinies of the jīvas and also the modifications of prakṛti, the insentient nature.</p>
			<h2>JĪVAS OR INDIVIDUAL SOULS</h2>
			<p>A jīva or an individual soul, is the centre of the I-sense which is endowed with consciousness and will. It has the powers to know, to act and to enjoy. It is atomic in size, but can pervade the body it occupies. It is a knower with an inherent capacity to know itself and others. It is a pratibimba or a reflection of God and hence gets a faint colouring of some of his attributes like self-luminosity and bliss. However, it is ever dependent on him.</p>
			<p>The jīvas are infinite in number and are all different from one another as also from all the products of prakṛti. Each is unique. Its ignorance of its real nature as the centre of consciousness, different from the body-mind complex, is called &#x2018;avidyā&#x2019; and is due to the will of God. It is this that has brought about its saṁsāra or transmigratory bondage.</p>
			<p>Unlike the other systems of Vedānta, the dvaita system of Madhva categorises the jīvas into three permanent groups: mukti-yogyas (those which are fit for salvation), nitya-saṁsārins (the eternally transmigrating ones) and the tamo-yogyas (the damned ones). The jīvas of the first group are receptive to spiritual values. By concentrated spiritual disciplines and the grace of God, they can get salvation. Those of the second group are worldlings who delight only in worldly values and feel no need for ethical and spiritual life. Hence they undergo transmigration eternally. The jīvas of the last group are positively evil by nature, go on progressively degenerating, finally ending in eternal perdition.</p>
			<h2>PRAKṚTI OR NATURE</h2>
			<p>Prakṛti or nature is the ultimate source of the physical universe. It is eternal but insentient. The three guṇas—sattva, rajas and tamas—are regarded as its first products. From them emerge in succession the mahat (intellect), ahaṅkāra (egoism), manas (mind), the indriyas (sensory organs) and the five bhūtas (elements like earth, water etc.). This evolution of prakṛti is similar to that in Sāṅkhya philosophy. However, being a dependent reality, it evolves, not by itself but by the will of God, who again, exercises his will as per the karmas or deserts of the jīvas.</p>
			<p>Since prakṛti is the upādānakāraṇa or the material cause of the universe, it is necessary to describe here the dvaita view about the cause and effect relationship. When a pot is produced out of clay, clay is the cause (kāraṇa) and pot is the effect (kārya). The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika view that the effect did not exist in the cause, is called &#x2018;asatkāryavāda,&#x2019; the doctrine that the effect did not exist (asat) in the cause. The Sāṅkhya-Yoga view, accepted by certain schools of Vedānta also, is that the effect (kārya) pre-existed (sat) in the cause (kāraṇa) though in a subtle form. This view is called &#x2018;satkāryavāda&#x2019;. The Dvaita Vedānta however, differs from both these schools and puts its own view, viz., &#x2018;sad-asat-kārya-vāda,&#x2019; the doctrine that the effect is both sat (existent) and asat (non-existent) though not simultaneously. Before production, the pot, existed as the kāraṇa or the cause but not as kārya or effect. After its production it existed as kārya or effect, but not as kāraṇa or cause. The Dvaita Vedānta, however, like other doctrines, recognizes the efficient cause (nimittakāraṇa) also.</p>
			<h2>AVYĀKṚTA-ĀKĀŚA OR UNMODIFIEDSPACE</h2>
			<p>The dvaita system postulates an avyākṛta-ākāśa or unmodified space, as a fundamental and permanent category, co-eval with God. It is different from the bhūtākāśa or elemental space which is a product of prakṛti. This ākāśa enables one to perceive dik (direction), like east and west. It exists even in pralaya or dissolution. It is infinite.</p>
			<h3>MOKṢA OR LIBERATION</h3>
			<p>A jīva is in saṁsāra or bondage, due to avidyā or ignorance induced in him by God, the absolutely independent Reality. Hence it is only by the grace of God that a jīva can get liberation from that bondage.</p>
			<p>A jīva must first acquire jñāna or knowledge of God—his greatness and goodness—through the scriptures by approaching a competent guru or preceptor. Śravaṇa (listening to the scriptures), manana (reflecting on their teachings) and dhyāna (meditation) will induce bhakti or devotion towards God and ultimately win his prasāda or grace. Thus it is bhakti that is the primary means of salvation, in this system. The ninefold devotion that is described in the <em>Bhāgavata</em> (7.5.23) is strongly recommended by Madhva for liberation. Madhva does not recognise vidveṣa-bhakti (&#x2018;hatred-devotion&#x2019;) of Hiraṇyakaśipu or Śiśupāla as bhakti and considers it as a eulogy of concentration. He does not recommend madhura-bhakti (lustful attitude towards God as by the gopis of Bṛndāvana) to ordinary mortals and declares it as fit only for the apsara (nymph-like) jīvas.</p>
			<p>Vairāgya or a spirit of renunciation and purity of mind by the practice of Karmayoga as described in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā </em>must precede the above-mentioned disciplines. Duties pertaining to one&#x2019;s life must be continued to be performed till the end.</p>
			<p>All this applies only to the mukti-yogya jīvas and not to the other two varieties.</p>
			<p>In mokṣa, the jīva attains its original state of freedom and bliss in accordance with its intrinsic capacity. Since no two jīvas are identical, gradation persists even in the state of liberation.</p>
			<p>After the death of the body, such a jīva that has qualified to attain the final liberation has all of its karma destroyed, passes through several subtle regions led by the ātivāhikas or heavenly guides and goes to Brahmaloka, the supreme abode of Brahmā, also known as Hiraṇyagarbha. At the end of the kalpa or the creative cycle when Brahmaloka dissolves, the jīva, along with Brahmā, enters into Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of Viṣṇu, after abandoning the sūkṣmaśarīra or the subtle body and assuming a divine body made of śuddha-sattva (pure, untainted, sattva).</p>
			<p>The system also posits a fourfold distinction in mokṣa: sālokya (residence in the same region), sāmīpya (being near God), sārūpya (having a form similar to that of God) and sāyujya (togetherness with him).</p>
			<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
			<p>The contribution of the dvaita of Madhva to Indian philosophical tradition is considerable. Madhva&#x2019;s sharp logic cuts to pieces the snobbish attitude of some thinkers who consider devotion as secondary to knowledge, and restores it to its rightful place. For him to love is to know and to know is to love.</p>
			<p>Though his categorisation of the jīvas into three groups as salvable, world-bound and damnable, appears a little strange, he lifts God above all the blame for the evil in the world. His theology and ethics are supported by a strong epistemology. The doctrines of sākṣī, viśeṣa and bheda are his original contribution. He has also successfully established the harmony of the Upaniṣadic thoughts with those of the itihāsas (epics) and the purāṇas (mythology).</p>
			<p>An earnest study of his dvaita system can certainly enrich our knowledge and increase our devotion to God thus making our spiritual evolution much more easy.</p>

			<p>In the Hindu Mythological lore, time is expressed in immense quantities. A kalpa is a day of Brahmā, the creator. It is divided into 14 manvantaras and also into 1000 caturyugas. The caturyugas are: Kṛtayuga, Tretāyuga, Dvāparayuga and Kaliyuga. Thus, the Dvāparayuga is the third of the four yugas. Its duration is 8,64,000 human years.</p>

			<p>The science of building construction, architecture and town-planning was well-developed in ancient and medieval India. Works like the <em>Arthaśāstra</em> of Kauṭilya (300 B. C.), the <em>Mānasāra</em> (revised edition, 11th cent. A. D.), <em>Mayamata</em>, <em>Mānasollāsa</em> of king Someśvara (A. D. 1126-1138) and various purāṇas like the <em>Agnipurāṇa</em> and the <em>Matsyapurāṇa</em> contain a lot of information on this subject.</p>
			<p>Location and construction of the dvāras (entrances and doors) of buildings was considered as very important, not only from the standpoint of safety and beauty, but also of auspiciousness.</p>
			<p>A village or a town must have dvāras in the four cardinal directions and also four, in between, in the corners.</p>
			<p>Buildings too should have four main dvāras or doors on the four sides. Smaller doors can be constructed as per convenience.</p>
			<p>The main entrance door in a building should not be kept in the middle, but on either side only. But, in the case of temples it should be in the middle only.</p>
			<p>The most general rule for the dimension is that the height of the door should be twice the width (h = 2w).</p>
			<p>The doors are generally decorated with the carvings of leaves and creepers. The relief figures of Gaṇeśa, Sarasvatī and other deities should be there on both sides of a door.</p>
			<p>Though it is advisable to have two shutters, the door may have a single shutter also.</p>
			<p>The above-mentioned works give detailed measurements and instructions for the construction of doors.</p>

			<p>Places of pilgrimage are legion in Hinduism. In the olden days, when transport and communication were difficult, the devout Hindu cherished a life-time&#x2019;s ambition of visiting important pilgrim centres like Kāśī or Prayāga.</p>
			<p>One of the seven important places of pilgrimage which every Hindu liked to visit in his life, is Dvārakā or Dvārikā, also known as &#x2018;Dvārāvatī&#x2019;. It is situated on the sea-shore, near the Okha port in Saurashtra (Gujarat).</p>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa is said to have built it. It got submerged in the sea at the time of his departure from this world. </p>
			<p>Most of the scholars agree that the modern Dwarka along with the Bet-Dwarka (an island in the sea) could have been the same Dvārakā described in the Hindu mythological works and digests.</p>
			<p>A Viṣṇukṣetra (place dear to Lord Viṣṇu), Dvārakā has been highly eulogised in the Hindu religious works, especially the purāṇas.</p>
			<p>The main temple is that of Dvārakādhīśa or Raṇchoḍjī (Śrī Kṛṣṇa). The original temple could have been built during the Gupta period (A. D. 320-525) and repaired during the age of the Solaṅkis (9th to 13th cent. A. D.). It is situated on the bank of the Gomatī which is not a river but the back-waters of the Arabian sea. The main dome or tower is 42 metres (140 ft.) in height. The large maṇḍapa (open hall) has sixty pillars. There is enough space for pradakṣiṇa or circumambulation. In the garbhamandir or sanctum there is the beautiful image of Kṛṣṇa made of black stone, 90 cms (3 ft.) in height, with four arms. Pilgrims are permitted to touch the feet of the image and offer tulasi (holy basil) leaves.</p>
			<p>Other images in the temple campus are those of Ambā, Balarāma, Trivikrama and Pradyumna.</p>
			<p>There is a separate temple for Śiva as &#x2018;Kuśeśvara Mahādeva&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>There are nine bathing ghāṭs for pilgrims such as Saṅgama-ghāṭ, Nārāyaṇa ghāṭ, Vāsudeva-ghāṭ, Goghāṭ and so on.</p>
			<p>There is a small lake of salt water near one of the ghāṭs, called &#x2018;Niṣpāpa-sarovara&#x2019;. A bath here has been considered almost compulsory.</p>
			<p>Other temples in Dvārakā are those of Lakṣmīnārāyaṇa and Vāsudeva. The temple of Nāgeśvara-liṅga (Śiva) is an ancient one.</p>
			<p>Pilgrims sometimes undertake what is known as &#x2018;Dvārakāpradakṣiṇa,&#x2019; circumambulation of the whole place for which a particular order is prescribed.</p>
			<p>Śrī Kṛṣṇa-janmāṣṭamī is the biggest festival observed in the main temple.</p>
			<p>There is an ancient monastery—the Śāradāpīṭha—established by Śaṅkarā-cārya (A. D. 788-820) here.</p>

			<note />
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>All the Hindu temples built in the traditional style have dvārapālas or door-guardians, generally at the sides of the main doorway of the sanctum. Their iconographic details vary according to the sectarian affiliation of the temple (Śaiva, Śākta or Vaiṣṇava).</p>
			<figure><figcaption /></figure>
			<p>In Vaiṣṇava temples there are three pairs of dvārapālas: Caṇḍa and Pracaṇḍa at the sides of the temple; Jaya and Vijaya at the sides of the sanctum in the ardhamaṇḍapa; Pūrṇa and Puṣkara at the outside enclosure. Sometimes Nanda and Sunanda, as also Kumuda and Kumudākṣa are also mentioned as dvārapālas.</p>
			<p>There are other deities also who too function as guardians. For instance Garuḍa, Viṣvaksena, Ānanda, Vīrasena and Sambhava.</p>
			<p>In the Śiva temples the following four-armed guardians are shown: Nandi to the left and Mahākāla to the right of the eastern entrance; Vināyaka and Puṇḍarīka at the southern entrance; Vṛṣabha and Skanda at the western entrance; Devī and Caṇḍeśvara at the northern entrance.</p>
			<p>Daṇḍi, Muṇḍi, Āmoda, Pramoda and Kṣetrapāla are the other deities mentioned as guardians in Śiva temples.</p>
			<p>In the Devī temples the dvārapālas are: Vetāla and Karaṭa at the eastern entrance; Piṅgalākṣa and Bhrukuṭa at the southern entrance; Dhūmraka and Kukkuṭa at the western entrance; Raktākṣa and Sulocana at the northern entrance.</p>
			<p>Sometimes certain goddesses like Ṣaṣṭi, Kumārī, Dhanadā, Acalā and others are also projected as dvāramātṛkās or guardian deities of entrances.</p>
			<p>For temples of other deities like Kārttikeya and Gaṇeśa, the dvārapālas will be different.</p>

			<note>(&#x2018;mantra in two parts&#x2019;)</note>
		</head>
		<description>
			<p>In Śrīvaiṣṇavism—the practical religious aspect of Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta—prapatti or śaraṇāgati (total surrender to God) is a very important step of spiritual practice.</p>
			<p>In prapatti, one has to receive three mantras or sacred formulae from a compe-tent ācārya (spiritual preceptor). The first is the aṣṭākṣarīmantra (the eight-syllabled mantra) viz., <em>oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya</em>. The second is the dvaya or dvayamantra, a twofold mantra. The third is the caramaśloka, the 66th śloka of the 18th chapter of the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (&#x2018;<em>sarva-dharmān parityajya</em>...&#x2019;).</p>
			<p>The dvayamantra is:</p>
			<p type="poem">1. <em>śrīman-nārāyaṇa-caraṇau śaraṇaṁ prapadye</em> |</p>
			<p type="poem">2. <em>śrīmate nārāyaṇāya namaḥ</em> |</p>
			<p>The first mantra means: &#x2018;I take refuge at the feet of Śrī-nārāyaṇa&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The second one means: &#x2018;Obeisance to Śrī-nārāyaṇa.&#x2019;</p>
			<p>In both the mantras Nārāyaṇa is described as being with Śrī or Lakṣmī.</p>
			<p>Though the commentators declare that these mantras are part of the <em>Kaṭhaśruti</em>, the recensions available now do not contain them.</p>
			<p>This dvayamantra is called &#x2018;mantra-ratna&#x2019; and is considered a tāntrik mantra. Hence <em>all</em> have the right to receive it for spiritual evolution.</p>

		</head>
		<description>
			<p>Hinduism has always stressed the cultivation of moral and ethical virtues in the life of every individual since they conduce to happiness in personal life and peace in social life. Just as there are virtues to be assiduously cultivated, there are vices too, to be avoided and eliminated. One such vice that is classed among the ariṣaḍvargas or the six enemies of every human being, is dveṣa or hatred. Droha (desire to harm), krodha (anger) and amarṣa (intolerance) are its different forms and manifestations.</p>
			<p>It has been defined variously by the different philosophical systems. The Nyāya system considers it as one of the characteristics of the ātman (the jīva or soul) since it experiences the same, in the state of bondage. It is the desire to give up that which causes duḥkha, sorrow and suffering. The <em>Yogasūtras</em> (2.8) of Patañjali (200 B. C.) describes it as the residue in the mind after experiencing pain and suffering. Dveṣa is similar to fire since it burns, as it were, our mind.</p>
			<p>Dveṣa can be eliminated by removing the cause of dveṣa. However, viveka or discrimination in the mind, that pinpoints the evil effects of dveṣa on oneself, is a good method for eliminating it. So also, trying to see God in everyone and the hand of God in the happenings that bring us suffering, to reform and transform us, can be of great help.</p>

			<p>Persons belonging to the first three varṇas or castes are called &#x2018;dvijas&#x2019;. Literally, the word means &#x2018;One who is born a second time or twice-born&#x2019;.</p>
			<p>The first birth is the physical birth from the womb of the mother. The second is the spiritual birth brought about by the sacrament of upanayana. Hence all those who have undergone the upanayana ceremony—the brāhmaṇas, the kṣattriyas and the vaiśyas—are &#x2018;dvijas&#x2019;. However, in practice the term is more generally applied to the brāhmaṇas.</p>
			<p>The brāhmaṇas of Vedic learning are called &#x2018;vipras&#x2019; and the vipras with an excellent conduct are known as &#x2018;śrotriyas&#x2019;.</p>

			<p>Bhāratavarṣa (India) is in the first continent called Jambūdvīpa.</p>

			<p>In the mūrtiśilpaśāstra or iconography, all the measurements are based on tāla (measurement of the length of the face, which is equal to the span) as the basic unit. The images and associated figures are to be made as per this tālamāna system.</p>
			<p>The measurement of dvitāla (two tālas or spans, equal to 24 aṅgulas) is adopted while preparing the images of birds like swan, dwarfish spirits such as Kūṣmāṇḍa and for the Matsyāvatāra of Viṣṇu.</p>

			<p>Started perhaps as the academic title of a person who has studied two Vedas (dvi = two) it gradually became the family title of persons born as his descendants.</p>
			<p>Similarly is the evolution of the two other titles trivedī and caturvedī—for those who are the scions of the persons who had mastered three or four Vedas.</p>
			<p>Study of one Veda was the minimum expected of every dvija or the twice-born.</p>

			<p>Creation of this world is a topic that is invariably discussed in the darśanas or systems of Indian philosophy. The Vaiśeṣika darśana of Kaṇāda accepts paramāṇus or atoms of earth, water, fire and air as the four fundamental substances from which this physical universe evolves.</p>
			<p>Impelled by the karma of the unredeemed jīvas or individual souls, at the beginning of the creation, two paramāṇus are united forming a &#x2018;dvyaṇuka&#x2019;. Three such dvyaṇukas join together making a &#x2018;tryaṇuka&#x2019;. This process goes on till the entire physical world is finally created. (<em>vide Brahmasūtras</em> 2.2.11 and Śaṅkara&#x2019;s commentary on the same.)</p>

		<description>
			<p>Derived from the root &#x2018;div&#x2019; (= to shine) the word &#x2018;dyaus&#x2019; or &#x2018;dyo&#x2019; represents heaven, the region of light. It is sometimes treated as a deity, as the father of both gods and human beings. Pṛthvī is considered as the mother. Hence the use of the word &#x2018;dyāvāpṛthivī&#x2019; as the parents of all beings. These divine parents are invoked to give their worshippers rains, food, wealth and success in life.</p>

			<p>Princess Sāvitrī has been highly eulogised in the Hindu mythological lore as an ideal wife, nay, the very personification of wifely virtues like chastity and singular devotion to the husband. Satyavān was her fortunate husband.</p>
			<p>Dyumatsena, the king of the Sāḷva country was his father. Though he was devoted to dharma and ruled well, he lost his eyesight and was conquered by a rival king who drove him out of his kingdom. He lived in a forest along with his wife and son Satyavān. Princess Sāvitrī chose to marry Satyavān even though she was apprised that he would die very soon.</p>
			<p>Dyumatsena regained his eyesight and the kingdom due to Sāvitrī&#x2019;s prayer to Yama, the god of death.</p>

			<p>Gambling with dice play seems to be an ancient pastime, especially for kings. The <em>Ṛgveda</em> (10.34) contains the piteous laments of a gambler. The notorious game of dice between Yudhiṣṭhira and Śakuni (on behalf of Duryodhana) described in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> is now history, as the root-cause of the Kurukṣetra war. In the purāṇas and the dharmaśāstras there are statements of condemnation of the gambling with dice-play. At the same time rules to regulate it too have been described! It was perhaps necessary to control it since it existed as an unavoidable evil.</p>
			<p>The dice pieces are made of vibhītaka wood (a kind of myrobalan).</p>
			<p>The game has to be conducted in a public place supervised by a sabhika (who gives the place and collects some rent for it) and some expert gamblers, who will act as umpires. The defeated person has to pay a part of his loss to the king as tax which may be 5 to 10 per cent. It is the duty of the sabhika or the agents of the king to see that the stake money is paid by the losing party to the victor. In circumstances where the loser loses everything, becoming a beggar, the king prevents it by providing for the bare maintenance of the loser.</p>
			<p>The kings used to permit gambling centres as one of the methods for finding out thieves and criminals.</p>
			<p>An arranged dice-play is a ritual part of the Rājasūya sacrifice.</p>
